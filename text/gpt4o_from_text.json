Branch spreads are irregular but lean horizontally.\n- The gradient dividing the grassland and background begins approximately at one-third from the bottom of the image, creating distinct planes of depth.\n- The size of the giraffes' legs, necks, and bodies should reflect their relative anatomical proportions: the neck length is about equal to their torso from shoulder to rear hip.\n\n---\n\nThis description outlines the critical components of the scene necessary to recreate its structure and essence in SVG format, ensuring adherence to naturalistic detail and proportional relationships.",
  "v1_107": "This is a detailed analysis of the given image to facilitate its recreation as an SVG:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n#### **Aircraft:**\n- **Central Object**: The main subject of the image is a passenger airplane, captured head-on as it takes off or lands on a runway.\n- **Shape**: The airplane is symmetrically aligned with its fuselage centered and wings stretched horizontally across the image (spanning nearly the entire width). The nose is rounded, the cockpit is located at the top-front of the fuselage, and the engines are circular underneath the wings.\n- **Engines**: Two large cylindrical jet engines are mounted on each wing. They appear circular from the front, with visible turbine blades inside the dark openings. The inner rims of the engines are clearly defined.\n- **Landing Gear**: The aircraft’s landing gears are fully extended and visible underneath the fuselage. They include vertical struts, two main gear assemblies with visible wheels on each side, and smaller details like hydraulic components.\n\n#### **Background Elements:**\n- **Urban Skyline**: A cityscape of buildings is in the background. This includes mid-rise and high-rise buildings with geometric, rectangular forms.\n- **Mountains and Sky**: The backdrop above the urban skyline shows faint silhouettes of mountains (soft, undulating curves) and a hazy, pale blue-gray sky.\n  \n#### **Runway:**\n- A runway stretches toward the airplane from the bottom of the image, forming a perspective that converges toward the distant horizon. \n- **Runway Markings**: Clearly defined rectangular white markings are evenly spaced on the asphalt. These markings narrow toward a vanishing point, emphasizing the perspective.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n#### **Aircraft:**\n- **Fuselage**: The airplane is off-white (light beige or light gray) with subtle reflections of the surrounding light. Its surface is smooth and polished, creating a slightly glossy effect.\n- **Engines**: The interior of the engine openings is very dark (almost black), providing contrast with the pale color of the aircraft.\n- **Landing Gear**: The wheels and struts are matte black and metallic gray, with minimal reflections.\n\n#### **Background:**\n- **Sky**: The sky is a gradient of pale blue-gray with a hazy look, indicating atmospheric distortion or mist.\n- **Cityscape**: The buildings are muted, with beige, white, gray, and faint blue color tones. Their features are softened due to distance.\n- **Runway**: The runway is dark gray (asphalt) with clearly visible white markings that contrast sharply. Heat waves or jet exhaust distort the area behind the airplane, creating a rippling, blurry effect.\n\n#### **Lighting**: \n- Bright daytime lighting from the front-top-right illuminates the aircraft and runway.

Inside the mouth, the tongue and teeth can be seen, adding depth.\n   - Surrounding the face are two large, round black shapes representing the panda ears positioned symmetrically on the upper corners.\n\n2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**:\n   - The image uses stark contrasts with a monochrome palette: black and white.\n   - The background and majority of the face is white, while features like the eyes, mouth, and ears are in deep black.\n   - Texture isn’t prominent; this image relies on sharp edges and simple coloration creating a flat, 2D effect common in digital designs and meme art.\n\n3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**:\n   - The face occupies the center of the entire image frame.\n   - The eyes are evenly spaced horizontally about a quarter of the way from the top of the frame, with the mouth situated in the lower half, occupying a significant portion of the vertical space.\n   - Ears appear diagonally, each slightly above and outward from the eyes, closely coordinating the rounded symmetry typical of panda imagery.\n\n4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**:\n   - The image adopts a simplistic and bold style, characteristic of digital artwork often used in memes.\n   - Exaggeration is a key element, particularly in using enlarged facial features to convey humor or emotional intensity.\n   - Sharp contrasts and clear demarcations between facial features evoke a cartoon-like style.\n\n5. **Specific Details**:\n   - There are no text elements or additional symbols, maintaining focus solely on the visual parody of a panda face.\n   - The overall layout is balanced vertically, with the mouth serving as the anchor.\n   - To translate proportions and placement into SVG, geometric points for the eyes, mouth, and ears should respect a grid that emphasizes symmetry and exaggerated proportions to ensure the humorous intent is preserved.\n\nBy maintaining this balance and simplicity in shapes, the recreated SVG will capture the intended humorous depiction of a panda-themed face combining human-like caricature elements.",
  "v1_157": "This image is a humorous and stylized representation of a cat with exaggerated features. Below is a detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- **Cat's Face:** The primary object in the image, featuring a close-up of a white and black cat with an exaggerated open mouth. The mouth occupies a large portion of the center area, stretched in a dramatic, unnatural oval shape.\n- **Eyes:** The cat’s eyes are squinting, forming crescent-like curves towards the sides of its head.\n- **Mouth Interior:** The interior of the mouth is almost circular but slightly oval, deep, and dark black.\n- **Tear Marks:** Multiple stylized, symmetrical lines represent tears streaming down from the corners of each eye. These lines are thin, short strokes in light blue.\n- **Text:** The Chinese character \"妈!\" (which means \"Mom!\") is centered within the cat’s mouth. This text is bright white with a clean sans-serif font.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- **Fur:** The texture of the cat’s fur is soft but simplified in tone. The majority of the fur is white with black patches, particularly around the ears and part of the forehead.\n- **Mouth Interior:** Deep black with subtle gradients towards the edges where it meets the fur.\n- **Ears:** Black with a slightly pinkish inner layer.\n- **Nose:** Small, triangular pink nose in the center of the face.\n- **Tear Streaks:** Solid light blue strokes.\n- **Background:** The background is a plain, neutral light grey with no distracting elements.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The cat’s face takes up approximately 80% of the image, leaving minimal background visible.\n- The mouth is central in both the horizontal and vertical axes. It is disproportionately large in relation to the rest of the face.\n- The eyes, though squinting, are positioned symmetrically on either side of the face, and the tear streaks angle downward from the outer corners.\n- The text \"妈!\" is perfectly centered inside the circular mouth, creating a humorous focal point.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The image appears digitally edited, particularly in the exaggerated size and shape of the mouth and the addition of cartoon-like tear lines.\n- The overall style blends realism (in the natural texture of the cat’s fur and facial features) with exaggerated, meme-oriented elements (oversized mouth, tears, and text).\n- The tonal contrast is high, with dramatic differences between the bright whites of the fur and the deep black of the mouth.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- **Text:** The text \"妈!\" is centrally placed and perfectly horizontal. The font has clean, bold edges and is proportionate to the width of the mouth.\n- **Symbols:** The thin blue tear streaks resemble comic-style visual cues for sadness or crying.\n- **Facial Features:** The nose and fur details are realistic, but the exaggerated mouth and tears shift the mood to playful and comical.\n\n---\n\n### Geometric Details for SVG Reproduction:\n- **Face Outline:** Create a slightly uneven oval for the outline of the cat's face, emphasizing natural asymmetry.\n- **Mouth:** Draw an elongated upright oval or ellipse for the mouth, set centrally on the face. It should occupy about 50% of the face width.\n- **Eyes:** Use curved lines or crescent shapes for the eyes, with their arc opening downwards. Position them symmetrically about 25% from the top of the image.\n- **Ears:** Draw tall, sharply triangular shapes for the ears, with slight inward curves at the base. The black patches should cover about 80% of each ear.\n- **Tear Lines:** Draw short, slightly diagonal, and evenly spaced strokes starting at the outer corners of the eyes. Use repetitive line elements with slight downward angles for realism.\n- **Text:** Position the text \"妈!\" to fit neatly within the central oval mouth. Scale it so it occupies about 25% of the mouth diameter.\n\n--- \n\nThis level of detail should allow an accurate SVG reproduction of this humorous and exaggerated cat image.",

Approximately 4 of these stars contain concentric rings of light.\n  - A large crescent moon is displayed in the upper-right corner. The moon is a solid yellow crescent with subtle brighter curves giving it depth.\n\n- **Cypress Tree:**\n  - A dark, towering, flame-like cypress tree occupies the left foreground. It has a pointed peak that touches nearly the top of the image.\n  - The tree is an elongated, uneven triangular shape with undulating edges, resembling natural irregularity.\n\n- **Hills and Landscape:**\n  - Curving hilltops dominate horizontally across the lower half of the image. These hills are made up of flowing, curved lines filled with darker blues and purples.\n  - One prominent hill shape near the center of the image curves upward and provides a backdrop for the sky swirls.\n\n- **Townscape Below:**\n  - At the bottom of the image is a small village with houses and a vertical white church steeple. The steeple is positioned near the center of the lower half, creating a prominent vertical element.\n  - Houses are rectangular blocks, mostly topped with triangular or slanted rooftops. Some have faintly colored roofs (red, brown, blue-gray).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Primary Colors:**\n  - The sky is dominated by shades of blue, ranging from deep indigo to lighter, almost-teal tones.\n  - Stars, the moon, and their surrounding halos are bright yellow and white, contrasting heavily with the blue background.\n  - The cypress tree appears as deep black-green, almost silhouetted against the lighter sky.\n  - Hills are various shades of dark blues and purples.\n\n- **Texture:**\n  - The entire painting consists of short, visible, swirling brushstrokes that underscore movement and turbulence. These strokes are curved in the sky, following flowing and spiral forms.\n  - The sky elements (swirls and stars) are layered with circular, dynamic, and radiating textures.\n  - The townscape below features denser, smaller, and more geometric strokes, creating a calmer texture compared to the sky.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- The canvas can be divided into three horizontal bands:\n  1. **Top Section:** Dominated by the sky and celestial elements. The swirls occupy the center-right portion, while stars and the crescent moon are evenly distributed.\n  2. **Middle Section:** Represents the hills and background landscape, curving horizontally and forming a natural division.\n  3. **Bottom Section:** Occupied by the townscape and the dark cypress tree on the left foreground.\n\n- **Proportional Relationships:**\n  - The cypress tree takes up about 20%-25% of the image horizontally and reaches upward into the top third of the canvas.\n  - The circular stars and swirls are proportionally large, with the largest star about 10% of the height of the painting.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- The painting is rendered in Van Gogh’s signature **Post-Impressionist** style.\n- Thick, textured brushstrokes dominate, with an emphasis on exaggerated movement and emotion.\n- The swirling shapes and overlapping curves define the painting’s dynamism, creating the illusion of movement and wind.\n- Perspective is somewhat flattened, with abstracted proportions placing less emphasis on realism and more on emotional impact.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n\n- **Key Symbols:**\n  - The cypress tree is often interpreted as a bridge between earthly and celestial realms.\n  - The spiraling swirls evoke the cosmos or turbulence in the natural world.\n\n- **Geometric Details for SVG:**\n  - The stars and moon can be approximated as circular shapes with layered rings emanating outward. Start with concentric ellipses in yellows and whites.\n  - The sky swirls are dynamic, irregular curves that intertwine. Begin creating these with flowing Bézier paths to mimic the spirals.\n  - The village consists of rectangles and triangles for the houses, with a singular vertical triangle for the white church steeple. The proportions of the rooftops vary slightly to give natural irregularity.\n  - The cypress tree is an elongated brushstroke-like shape, beginning wider at its base and narrowing as it rises with sharp points.\n\n---\n\nBy following these geometric guidelines and visual descriptions, the painting can be accurately interpreted into an SVG format with layered shapes, flowing curves, and detailed color distributions.",

  "v1_30": "### Detailed Image Description:\n\n#### 1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**  \nThe image features two F-14 Tomcat fighter jets in flight above a cloud-filled landscape during what appears to be a late afternoon or early evening golden hour. The jets are the focus, with the closer jet dominating the foreground, while the second jet appears smaller in the background, slightly above and behind the first.  \n\n- **Foreground Jet:** This F-14 Tomcat is displayed prominently, viewed from a rear-side angle that shows its swept-back wings, twin-engine exhaust nozzles, vertical stabilizers, and cockpit canopy. It has sharp, angular surfaces reflective of its aerodynamic design.  \n- **Background Jet:** The second F-14 is further away, appearing smaller with less detail. It matches the design of the first jet and maintains an angular and dynamic silhouette.\n\n#### 2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \n- **Core Color Palette:** The jets have a muted gray exterior with darker panel lines and subtle weathering marks across their surfaces, indicative of wear and a functional military aesthetic.  \n- **Cockpit Canopy:** The canopy has a reflective, slightly tinted effect, with visible transparency that hints at two seats (pilot and co-pilot) inside, though details of the personnel are blurred.  \n- **Engines & Exhausts:** The twin exhaust nozzles are metallic, with a mix of silver and darker gray tones. Subtle gradients depict lighting effects.  \n- **Cloudscape:** The background contains a fluffy, clustered layer of white and off-white clouds with some golden tones created by the sunlight. The ocean below the clouds is dimly visible, reflecting sunlight in shimmering tones of gold.  \n- **Lighting and Shadows:** The sun is positioned off to the upper right, casting warm golden highlights along the upper fuselage, wings, and vertical stabilizers of the closer jet. Shadows fall on the underside and back of the jet, emphasizing depth and detail in the paneling.  \n\n#### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \n- **Foreground Jet:** Positioned slightly left-of-center and angled to the right, this jet occupies about 60% of the frame. The camera perspective places the viewer just above and behind the aircraft, creating a sense of dynamic movement and depth.  \n- **Background Jet:** Located higher and further back in the upper-right quadrant of the image, the distant F-14 is roughly 1/3 the size of the foreground one due to perspective. It trails behind in a complementary but less dominant position within the composition.  \n- **Clouds and Horizon:** The clouds extend horizontally across the bottom third of the image, while the horizon line tilts slightly downward to the left, adding dynamic visual tension.  \n\n#### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- The image is hyper-realistic, almost photographic in its artistry, with a focus on detailing the jets’ military-grade construction, lighting effects, and textural accuracy.  \n- The coloration evokes realism, while the golden lighting enhances drama and adds an atmospheric, cinematic quality to the scene.  \n- The art style is consistent with digital rendering, leveraging fine details in shading, reflections, and environmental interaction (e.g., sunlight on metal).\n\n#### 5. **Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n- **Foreground Jet Markings:**  \n  - The vertical stabilizers bear a patch-like design with the text \"BLACK ACES\" (top) and \"41\" (center), along with the squadron insignia positioned within a black diamond. Below the diamond, \"USS ENTERPRISE\" is printed.  \n  - The right fuselage includes \"*101*\" in bold black numbers near the cockpit, followed by a star insignia with \"NAVY\" printed beneath.  \n  - Additional smaller text decals and labels (e.g., \"F-14A,\" manufacturer markings, and warning labels) are scattered along its fuselage and near the wing root, though they might be illegible without zooming in.  \n  - Missile bays and weapon systems under the wings further reinforce the military purpose of the aircraft.  \n- **Background Jet Symbols:** Similar markings to the foreground jet, though these are less discernible due to the distance and size of the plane.  \n\n### Geometric Details and Proportions (for SVG Accuracy):  \n- **Foreground Jet Dimensions:** \n  - The wings form a wide triangular span, tapering sharply toward the back. The body length of the jet is roughly 3:1 compared to its height in this perspective.  \n  - The twin tail fins form near-equilateral triangles and are angled slightly outward.  \n  - The engines and rear fuselage occupy about 25% of the total visible area of the jet.  \n- **Background Jet Dimensions:**  \n  - Proportions are consistent with the foreground jet but scaled down (approximately 30%) due to distance.  \n- **Positioning of Jets Relative to Each Other:**  \n  - The background jet is offset diagonally upward, with its center approximately aligned with the foreground jet’s rear right vertical stabilizer.  \n- **Clouds and Horizon:**  \n  - The horizon line is slightly skewed in alignment, with the cloud layer stretching near-parallel to it.  \n\n### Reproduction Notes:  \nFor SVG recreation:  \n- Create geometric shapes for the jets (e.g., wings as polygons, fuselage as elongated ovals or composite paths). Ensure panel lines, markings, and shapes are precise.  \n- Use gradients to replicate lighting effects, especially on the fuselage and clouds.  \n- Utilize texture overlays or patterns to emulate weathered surfaces and metallic panels.  \n- Include transparency for the cockpit canopy and reflective gradients to highlight lighting realism.  \n\nThis breakdown provides sufficient architectural, proportional, and stylistic details to recreate the image faithfully in SVG format.",

Its chest and throat are a warm, rusty orange transitioning into a white underbelly. The texture of the feathers is smooth and neatly layered.\n  - **Second from left (Tufted Titmouse - 1)**: This bird has soft gray feathers on its body, with pale cream-colored underparts. Its crest is slightly raised, and it has a dark spot above its beak near the eye. Fine feather detailing is visible.\n  - **Third from left (Tufted Titmouse - 2)**: Similar to the previous bird, but positioned as if chirping; the open beak is visible. The plumage and colors are identical to its counterpart.\n  - **Fourth bird (Female Northern Cardinal)**: This bird has a beige-brown body with hints of warm red on the wings, tail, and crest. Its crest is prominent, a muted red-orange bill is visible, and the feather texture is soft but visibly layered.\n  - **Fifth bird (Male Northern Cardinal)**: Bright red all over with deeper crimson hues on the wings, slightly fluffed feathers along the chest and tail. The crest is tall, and the vibrant orange-red beak creates contrast. Its feathers appear slightly more textured than the other birds.\n  - **Far-right bird (Female Eastern Bluebird)**: A blend of soft gray, orange, and white tones. It has a rusty-orange chest that fades into a white underbelly, with soft bluish-gray wings and back.\n- **Branch**: The branch is slightly mottled with shades of brown and green, textured to hint at moss or lichen. It's uneven in thickness and includes sections of budding green leaves, indicating springtime.\n- **Background**: A light green and gray bokeh effect with no distinct objects. The colors are soft and muted, ensuring that the birds and branch remain the focal point.\n\n#### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**:\n- The birds are evenly spaced along the branch except for a slight clustering of the second and third birds from the left. \n- The branch spans horizontally across the middle of the image with a very slight upward curve.\n- The birds are positioned in the foreground, creating depth against the blurred background. The spacing suggests a natural alignment, not perfectly symmetrical but balanced.\n- Some small twigs extend diagonally out from the branch, creating additional natural detail without cluttering the focus.\n\n#### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**:\n- The image is realistic with great attention to detail in the birds' plumage and form. Subtle lighting enhances the contours of the birds' feathers and adds dimension, but the overall light is soft and diffused.\n- The style is photographic with naturalistic composition, emphasizing the colors and textures of the birds. The depth of field isolates the subjects (birds and branch) while maintaining a harmonious soft-focus background indicative of a professional wildlife photograph.\n\n#### 5. **Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**:\nThere is no text or visible symbols present in the image. The details to note for reproduction:\n- **Proportions**: The birds are approximately uniform in size relative to one another, with slight variation in bulk (e.g., the male cardinal is slightly larger and more robust than the Eastern Bluebird).\n- **Angles**: Each bird is captured at a slight side angle, showing one profile of the body but with slight variations (e.g., the Titmouse tilts its head slightly forward, giving a chirping expression).\n- **Small Details**:\n  - The texture and subtle coloration of feathers should be replicated.\n  - The natural irregularity of the branch should be captured, including slight protrusions and budding.\n  - Leaves are sparse, oval-shaped, and a vibrant green, appearing freshly emerged.\n\nThis detailed breakdown provides all necessary information to recreate the image as an SVG accurately, including layout positions, shapes, colors, and proportional relationships.",

Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Notification Text**:\n  - \"AT&T\" for carrier information.\n  - Time displayed in the top right as 6:00.\n  - Specific notification content \"Blur Noc NOC2: Wed Oct 6 00:55:01 U... about a minute ago\"\n  - Motorola logo in a rounded rectangle to the left of notification text.\n- **Symbols**: Network signal, WiFi, and battery status icons are typical and small above the notification bar.\n- **App Icons**: \n  - \"Text Mess\" for messaging.\n  - \"Market\" with an icon resembling a green bag.\n  - \"Browser\" featuring an icon with a globe motif.\n  - Round application menu symbol serving as central navigation.\n\nThis description should facilitate an accurate SVG recreation by focusing on proportional layout choices, color composition, and object elements.",
  "v1_99": "The image is an illustrative diagram representing a marine food web. Below is a detailed description of its elements and layout suitable for SVG recreation.\n\n1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n   - **Animals and Plants:** The image includes varied marine and coastal organisms, including a blue whale, killer whale, seagull, leopard seal, elephant seal, penguin, fish, krill, squid, crab, zooplankton, seaweed, and phytoplankton.\n   - **Arrows:** Black arrows connect the different organisms, illustrating the direction of the food web, indicating who eats whom.\n\n2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n   - **Blue Whale:** The whale is depicted in shades of blue with darker accents along the dorsal ridge, conveying its massive size.\n   - **Killer Whale:** It features a black body with white patches, capturing the classical coloration of an orca.\n   - **Seagull:** The bird has a white body with a grey back, red legs and beak, and a black wing edge.\n   - **Leopard Seal:** Exhibiting shades of grey with spots, the seal has a menacing mouth open to suggest predation.\n   - **Elephant Seal:** Colored in brown tones, this seal is illustrated with large dimensions, indicative of its hefty size.\n   - **Penguin:** Its design includes a black back with white belly and red feet, with slight tilting to add to its animated posture.\n   - **Fish:** The fish is bright blue with darker patterns; its simplistic representation adds vibrancy.\n   - **Krill, Squid, Crab, Zooplankton:** These smaller organisms are meticulously detailed; the krill and squid are reddish and purplish respectively, the crab is orange-red and zooplankton has greens and browns.\n   - **Seaweed and Phytoplankton:** Various shades of green represent the plant life, with the phytoplankton shown as intricate algae forms.\n\n3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n   - The diagram is organized with larger organisms (whales, seals, sharks) in the upper half and smaller prey (fish, krill, squid) centrally or in the lower half. Seaweed and phytoplankton are positioned towards the bottom corners, signaling the beginning of the food chain process.\n   - Arrows are used liberally with varied lengths and directions to guide the viewer's eye from prey to predator, creating dynamic flow throughout the image.\n\n4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n   - The illustration employs a hand-drawn, cartoon-like style with bold outlines and soft, filled colors.\n   - The lack of shadows and gradients enhances a flat, simplified aesthetic typical of educational cartoons.\n\n5. **Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n   - Each animal or organism is accompanied by text labels indicating its name, using a simple sans-serif font.\n   - Arrows vary in size but remain consistent in style, serving as connectors that clarify relationships between organisms.\n   - Certain elements like the fish or squid exhibit dynamic poses – the fish appears to be swimming actively, while the squid shows elongated tentacles, suggesting movement.\n\nFor SVG recreation, emphasize proportions by appropriately resizing elements relative to each other (e.g., ensuring whales appear larger than squid or fish), and accurately positioning the organisms to mirror their hierarchy in the food web. Use consistent color fills and outline strokes to maintain the illustrative style, and ensure text is readable and correctly placed adjacent to each corresponding organism."
