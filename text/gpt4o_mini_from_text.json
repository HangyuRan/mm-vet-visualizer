  "v1_0": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description of the image for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\nThe image consists entirely of handwritten mathematical notation. The equation reads:\n\n```\n(X + 3)^2 = 4\n```\n\n- The equation is written in large, flowing, cursive-style handwriting with a slightly irregular, organic stroke.\n- Every character is a distinct glyph with rounded, fluid curves (no sharp corners), and the stroke is uniform in thickness.\n\n#### Elements Breakdown (from left to right):\n- **Left parenthesis**: Large, tall and curved, encasing the variables and constants inside.\n- **X**: Uppercase, slightly slanted to the right, with the two arms crossing near the center.\n- **Plus sign (+)**: Centered between the X and 3, the horizontal and vertical strokes are roughly equal in length.\n- **Numeral 3**: Handwritten digit with open top and bottom, rounded and prominent.\n- **Right parenthesis**: Symmetrical to the left parenthesis, equally tall and curved.\n- **Exponent '2'**: Small handwritten digit “2” positioned as a superscript above and slightly to the right of the right parenthesis.\n- **Equals sign (=)**: Two horizontal, moderately long strokes, at the central height of the equation.\n- **Numeral 4**: Handwritten digit “4”, distinct and slightly angled, with an open top.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Color**: All characters and symbols are rendered in a bright, neon green (#72E100 is an approximate hex code). There are no gradients or variations in tone.\n- **Texture**: The stroke appears smooth and uniform throughout; no fill, just the stroke, reminiscent of a digital handwriting on a whiteboard.\n- **Background**: Solid white, no shading or elements other than the equation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Layout**: The entire equation is written horizontally, occupying a single line, centered top-to-bottom within the frame.\n- **Proportions**:\n  - The parentheses are the tallest elements, extending below and above the baseline of the other characters.\n  - The 'X', '+', and '3' are of equal height, with the 'X' slightly taller than the '3'.\n  - The exponent '2' is much smaller (about 1/3 the height of the parentheses), placed as a superscript.\n  - The equals sign sits at the midline, and the '4' aligns with the main character height.\n- **Spacing**:\n  - Even, generous horizontal gaps between each element (parenthesis, letters, numbers, and operators do not touch).\n  - Parentheses enclose 'X + 3' snugly, with small gaps before 'X' and after '3'.\n  - The exponent is offset up and to the right from the right parenthesis by a small but noticeable gap.\n  - The equals sign is about one-and-a-half character widths to the right of the parenthesis.\n  - The '4' is a full character width to the right of the equals sign.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Handwritten**: All elements appear to be written by hand, evident in the slight irregularities of line shape and curvature.\n- **Rounded and Playful**: Characters are generously rounded; no sharp angles.\n- **Bold-Stroke**: The line thickness is consistent and bold (suggested stroke width: 8–15% of average character height for SVG recreation).\n- **Casual**: Not perfectly geometric or typographically precise—there is a natural, human quality.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **Characters**:\n  - Uses uppercase 'X'\n  - Arabic numeral '3', '2', and '4'\n  - Arithmetic operators: parentheses, plus, exponent, equals sign\n- **No Additional Symbols**: No decorations, underlines, or extraneous marks.\n- **No Text Outside Equation**: The equation is the only content.\n- **No Borders or Framing**.\n\n---\n\n### SVG Geometric/Proportional Recommendations\n\n- **ViewBox** suggestion: width is approx 8x the height (landscape aspect ratio, e.g., 800 × 100 units).\n- **All strokes** at uniform thickness.\n- **Parentheses height**: 90% of total SVG height.\n- **Main characters (X, +, 3, 4)**: 75% of total SVG height (vertically centered).\n- **Exponent '2' height**: 20–30% of total SVG height, baseline aligned at 65–70% up from the main character baseline.\n- **Horizontal spacing**: Each element separated horizontally by 10–15% of a character width.\n- **Color**: All strokes #72E100 (RGB 114, 225, 0).\n\n---\n\n**Summary for SVG redrawing:**  \nA single mathematical equation, written in bright neon green, bold, smooth, and rounded handwritten script. The equation ‘(X + 3)² = 4’ occupies a single centered row, with the exponent raised. Parentheses are the tallest feature, and all elements are clearly and evenly spaced on a bright white background, with no other visual distractions or embellishments.",

  "v1_100": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description suitable for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n**Overall Layout:**\n- The image consists of two glass jars (Sample A and Sample B) placed side by side horizontally, each with a gray lid.\n- Each jar contains 8 colored balls (representing gas particles), equidistantly and irregularly distributed inside the jars.\n- Curved motion lines near some particles indicate movement.\n- Above the jars is an explanatory text. Below each jar is a sample label and particle data (mass and speed).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n**Jars:**\n- Outlines: Black, relatively thin lines; the jars are transparent (filled with white or non-color).\n- Shape: Rectangular body with rounded bottom corners and a narrow, short neck under a lid.\n- Lids: Rectangular, light gray with a slightly darker gray top to suggest thickness. The lid extends a small amount beyond the neck.\n- No visible texture; flat colors.\n\n**Particles:**\n- Sample A: Circles filled with *bright green* (#67c23a).\n- Sample B: Circles filled with *medium blue* (#757de8).\n- Particles are identical within each sample, with no outline or shadowing.\n\n**Motion Lines:**\n- Three curved black lines (arc-like) near a few of the particles, showing vibration or motion.\n- Sample A: 6 out of 8 particles have motion lines; Sample B: 4 out of 8 particles have motion lines.\n- Each grouping of lines is a set of three curves, spaced like a fan, smaller to larger.\n\n**Text:**\n- Title text (top): Black, bold sans-serif, left-aligned.\n- Labels under jars: “Sample A” and “Sample B” in bold black, sans-serif.\n- Below labels: Mass and speed information, normal weight sans-serif, smaller than the sample labels.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n**Jars:**\n- Horizontally aligned, with some space between them (approx. one jar width apart).\n- Vertically, both are positioned at the same height/base.\n\n**Particles:**\n- In both jars, 8 particles are arranged so they do not overlap or touch jar edges. Distribution is scattered, avoiding symmetry.\n- Motion lines are placed immediately adjacent to certain particles (never intersect or overlap the circles).\n\n**Text:**\n- Title spans both jars near the top.\n- Labels and details are centered under each respective jar.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Flat, illustrative style**: No shading, gradients, or complex textures. No 3D effects.\n- **Simple, geometric shapes**: Jars are built from rectangles and arcs, particles are perfect circles, and motion lines are smooth arcs.\n- **Minimalist**: Only essential details are included (particles, motion lines, jar/lid outlines).\n- **Emphasis**: Color is used to clearly differentiate between the two samples, and bold text highlights key labels.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n\n**Text (from top to bottom, centered over respective elements):**\n\n- *Top full-width text:*\n  ```\n  The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers.

  "v1_102": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description of the image, optimized for recreating the scene as an SVG:\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- **Dominant Structure:** The main focal point is a large, multi-story building that has collapsed into rubble. The collapsed building’s shape is irregular, with concrete beams, wall segments, floors, and rebar protruding in various directions. \n- **People:** Numerous figures (approx. 25-30) are scattered across the rubble. They are standing, bending, or climbing amidst the debris. A group of rescuers in **bright orange vests** is clustered toward the right-middle of the debris.\n- **Rubbles and Debris:** Large concrete slabs, blocks, and twisted reinforcement bars dominate the scene, forming heap-like mounds. There are visible broken columns, panels, lattice bricks, and scattered construction materials throughout.\n- **Smoke:** A thick, white plume of smoke (or dust) emanates from the center-left background, obscuring part of the distant skyline and adding a diffuse, hazy layer.\n- **Vehicles:** To the right edge, there is a red crane truck with an extended arm reaching towards the rubble. Near the bottom right, there are hints of construction or rescue vehicles partially visible under or beside debris.\n- **Background Buildings:** Behind the main rubble, several undamaged multi-story apartment buildings in muted greys and beiges form the urban background. These buildings are rectangular and blocky, with rows of windows.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- **Color Palette:** Dominated by muted, neutral tones: various grays (concrete, sky, smoke), off-whites (dust and stone), and browns/beiges (wooden segments, dirt).\n- **Accent Colors:** Bright safety orange from the rescuers’ clothing stands out vividly against the monotone ruins.\n- **Textures:** Jagged, rough surfaces from the broken concrete and brick. Some lattice-like patterns are visible in the exposed interior structure (wood or brickwork inside the collapsed building).\n- **Lighting:** Overcast, diffuse daylight with no harsh shadows, contributing to an overall flat, somber atmosphere.\n- **Smoke/Dust:** Semi-transparent, soft-edged white area starting at center-left, partially covering the far background.\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- **Foreground:** Large concrete slabs and random rubble, forming the base layer from bottom center to right and left sides.\n- **Middle Ground:** The collapsed building forms an uneven, diagonal ridge from lower left up toward upper right.\n- **Background:** Standing pillars of concrete from the former building rise vertically, especially notable near bottom center and bottom right. Survivors and rescuers are positioned throughout the middle and upper halves, some standing on high points of the debris, others clustered in operational groups.\n- **Focal Group:** The rescuers in orange vests are right of center, both standing and bending as if sifting or searching.\n- **Vehicles:** The crane truck is at far right, with its long arm slanted upward left toward the main debris.\n- **Background Horizon:** Apartment blocks are spaced across the upper third of the image, with the smoky haze sitting just below their rooflines.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- **Realism/Naturalism:** The image is a documentary-style photograph, so visual proportions and perspectives are true to life.\n- **Perspective:** Taken from a slightly elevated viewpoint, capturing both the close-up details of the wreckage and the broader scene.\n- **Line/Shape:** Dominated by angular, jagged shapes (collapsed slabs, beams, concrete pillars). Pillars are mainly vertical, slabs and debris are slanted and irregular. \n- **Emphasis:** The orange uniforms of rescuers draw the eye; the chaos and density of collapsed elements create a sense of disorder and urgency.\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n- **No visible text** or prominent symbols in the main area.\n- **Detailed Elements:**\n  - Concrete posts: cylindrical or rectangular, vertical, broken at the top.\n  - Rebar visible, protruding randomly from broken concrete.\n  - Orange safety vests (highly saturated).\n  - Smoke/dust is not a perfect geometric shape; it flows in soft, amorphous clouds.\n  - Latticework or slatted forms from the building’s destroyed interior.\n  - Red rectangular vehicle with articulating arm (crane) on far right.\n  - Fragmented blocks, small debris, and indistinct objects creating a granular background texture.\n\n---\n\n### **Proportions & Geometric Layout:**\n- **Rubble** covers **~80% of image height and width**; debris mounds reach roughly halfway up the image vertically.\n- **Standing figures** average about 1/10th image height.\n- **Pillars** are spaced irregularly but prominent along the bottom foreground.\n- **Main group with orange vests** occupies a **rectangular patch** roughly 1/5th of image width, right of center.\n- **Crane truck** occupies the bottom right **1/6th**.\n- **Background buildings** span horizontally, each block being about 1/10th image width.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for SVG:**\n- Use rough, overlapping polygons for debris.\n- Add vertical rectangles/cylinders for broken pillars.\n- Scatter ~25 human silhouettes, in black and a group in high-visibility orange.\n- Smoky area: use semi-transparent white/gray amorphous shapes.\n- Vehicles: blocky rectangle (truck) and a diagonally placed arm (polygon/line).\n- Background: rectangles with squares for windows for distant apartments, in muted gray-beige.\n\n---\n\nIf you need further breakdowns, color hex codes, or vector-specific layout, feel free to ask!",

The base of the neck begins halfway up, arcing left and downward into the bush, with its head not visible.\n  - The left giraffe is behind and slightly to the left of the first. Its head is bent leftward and downward, feeding on the acacia. Its neck starts at almost a right angle from its back, curves down toward the foliage, and most of its body is obscured by the bush and the right giraffe.\n  - The giraffe bodies overlap so that from a distance their bodies and necks appear to merge in an optical illusion, as if the right giraffe’s body has the left giraffe’s head attached.\n- **Acacia Bush:**  \n  - Central bush is positioned bottom-center, reaching about one third the image height, with many angular branches and a flattened, spreading top.\n  - Smaller trees frame the image at the far left and right.\n- **Grass:**  \n  - Ranges from the bottom of the frame to just below the giraffes' bellies.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic style:**  \n  - Fine, natural details, realistic shading, and organic shapes.\n  - No visible outlines.\n  - Lighting is diffuse, soft, natural daylight.\n  - Depth is suggested by the focus: foreground elements (giraffes and bush) are sharp, while background hills are misty and blurred.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n\n- **No text or symbols** present.\n- **Notable detail:**  \n  - The image creates an optical illusion due to the position and overlap of the giraffes and the bush: at first glance, it may appear as though a single giraffe has an impossibly long, bent neck, but closer inspection reveals it is two overlapping giraffes.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric & Layout Specifics for SVG:**\n\n- **Giraffes:**\n  - Each giraffe’s body is roughly a vertical oval (~1:2 width to height), necks are long, gently tapering curves (length ≈ body height), with irregular spots of varying sizes.\n  - Legs are long, thin rectangles, very slightly splayed; hooves implied by darker tips.\n  - Heads: small, oblong/oval with ossicones (horns) and small ears.\n- **Acacia bush:**\n  - Trunk is a branching, slightly curved line from ground, forking several times, with spindly branches extending horizontally and upward.\n  - Leaves are clustered, small ovals or polygons.\n- **Relative sizing:**  \n  - Giraffes’ bodies fill the center 2/3 of the frame width; their legs extend from bottom edge up to just above halfway height of frame.\n  - Main bush is almost as tall as the giraffes’ shoulders, extending horizontally 2/3 of image width.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table (for easy SVG mapping):**\n\n| Object           | Position (X, Y)         | Size/Proportion            | Shape                       | Color/Texture                  |\n|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Right Giraffe    | Center-right           | 30% width, 60% height      | Vertical oval, tapering neck| Light brown, dark brown spots |\n| Left Giraffe     | Left off-center        | 25% width, 60% height      | Similar, partial overlap    | As above                      |\n| Main Acacia Bush | Center-bottom to left  | 60% width, 35% height      | Branching, angular lines    | Dark brown, green leaves      |\n| Side Bushes      | Left/right edges       | 10% width, 25% height      | Vertical lines, spiky tops  | Same as above                 |\n| Grass            | Bottom border          | Fills lower 15–20%         | Irregular vertical lines    | Various green shades          |\n| Background Hills | Top two-thirds         | Full width, 15-20% height  | Smooth horizontal curves    | Desaturated blue-gray-green   |\n| Sky              | Upper 1/3              | Full width                 | Flat, untextured area       | Pale gray-blue                |\n\n---\n\n*No* artificial elements, text, or abstract stylization—**all natural, realistic forms and organic textures**.

  "v1_107": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive and detailed description of the image, optimized for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- **Central Object**: \n  - A large commercial jet aircraft (wide-body, twin-engine) viewed from the front, fully centered both horizontally and vertically in the image. The plane is slightly above the runway, immediately after takeoff, with extended landing gear.\n  - The aircraft’s main fuselage is a long, vertical oval/cylinder with a rounded nose at the top.\n  - Two large, circular jet engines are mounted under the straight, slightly dihedral wings. The engines appear as mostly black circles with a lighter rim.\n  - The wings extend horizontally left and right, tapering in thickness from root to tip with a slight upward curve (dihedral) and ending in subtle winglets angled slightly above the horizontal line.\n  - The nose gear and main landing gears are visible, fully extended and in light/dark grey tones.\n  - A small, vertical tailfin can be partially seen emerging from the top-rear of the fuselage, faint due to the perspective.\n\n- **Background Elements**:\n  - Faded cityscape with multiple rectangular high-rise buildings in grey, beige, and muted blue colors; these occupy the majority of the middle third of the image.\n  - Blue-grey hills and hazy sky in soft gradients with no strong visible clouds.\n  - The runway stretches from the bottom center vertically into the distance, marked by white dashed centerlines and solid side lines. Its surface is grey, with brown shoulders and green/gray grass at the margins.\n  - Atmospheric effects: Heat distortion/mirage ripples behind/below the aircraft and engines, causing a shimmering effect on the lower background and the near ground.\n  - Faint, diffused sunlight/reflection on the aircraft’s nose and landing gear.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Aircraft**:\n  - Predominantly white/light grey fuselage.\n  - Engine nacelles appear darker grey or nearly black inside.\n  - Landing gear and undercarriage: dark grey tones, with some metallic shine.\n  - Subtle black window cockpit at the very top center of the nose (short rectangle with curved corners).\n  - Navigation lights: slightly visible as tiny spots at wing tips (possibly red/green or white), and a single strong white landing/taxi light just below the nose.\n\n- **Runway**:\n  - Medium grey with white rectangular dashed lines, each dash being about 1/6 the width of the visible runway, separated by gaps of equal length.\n  - The runway edges fade into darker, brownish ground on both sides.\n\n- **Background**:\n  - Buildings: muted grey, tan, and blue tones; lack of sharp edges due to atmospheric haze.\n  - Sky: light blue to pale grey gradient, no clouds.\n  - Heat shimmer: Distorted, blurry mirage effect in lower third, especially behind the aircraft engines and along runway center, with increased color waviness.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Aircraft**: \n  - Centered perfectly on both the x and y axes of the image; the main point of focus.\n  - The wingspan occupies approximately 80-85% of the image width.\n  - The bottom of the main landing gears sits just above the lower third of the image.\n- **Engines**: \n  - Centered left and right beneath the wings, the same height as the nose’s midsection, equally spaced from the fuselage center.\n- **Runway**: \n  - Perspective lines of the runway converge toward the vanishing point behind the aircraft; the dashed centerline aligns perfectly with the aircraft’s centerline.\n- **Background buildings**: \n  - Spread horizontally, covering almost the entire backdrop, with tallest structures slightly left and right of the aircraft.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Photorealistic with shallow depth of field**: \n  - Sharp focus on the plane, slightly blurred cityscape and runway edges.\n  - Natural color palette, soft contrasts, and realistic lighting, without exaggerated saturation.\n  - Heat haze and atmospheric perspective provide depth and a sense of movement/energy.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n\n- **Markings**: \n  - No airline logos or liveries visible—plain white/grey fuselage, or markings are too small/indistinct due to frontal view/distance.\n  - Cockpit window: wide, rounded rectangle, sharply separated from the white of the nose.\n  - Runway: White rectangular dashes (approx. 10 visible, evenly spaced), no runway numbers or threshold markings visible at this angle.\n  - Landing lights: Single illuminated round light just under the aircraft nose.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric & Proportional Details for SVG Recreation**\n\n- **Aircraft**:\n  - Fuselage: Central vertical oval, occupying 20-25% image height; width (at widest) ≈8% of width.\n  - Wingspan: 80-85% image width, ~3% image height thickness at root, tapering to 1% at wingtips, slight upward angle.\n  - Engines: Circles of 7-8% image height, centered ~17% left/right of center, aligned horizontally with nose.\n  - Nose gear: Centered, rectangle protruding below fuselage, 4% height, 1% width, two small circles (wheels).\n  - Main gear: Rectangles, 10% height, 3% width, just inside each engine.\n- **Runway**:\n  - Centerline dashes: Repeated white rectangles, each 1.5% image height, 0.7% wide, vertically aligned with small gaps (~1.5%) between.\n  - Edges: Parallel lines diverge slightly going upward, vanishing point hidden by aircraft.\n- **Background**:\n  - Rectangular skyscrapers, variably spaced, heights range from 8%-20% of image height, widths 5%-15% of image width.\n  - Sky is a large rectangle from top to ~60% down, smooth uniform gradient.\n\n---\n\n*If you need further dimensional estimates, color codes, or have a specific size in mind for the SVG, please let me know!*",

  "v1_111": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive and detailed description of the image for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- **Zebra**: A single adult zebra is the central figure. It is standing on three legs (front left leg raised) and bending down with its muzzle touching the surface of a shallow pond, drinking water. The zebra is viewed mostly in left profile, its head turned slightly toward the viewer.\n- **Rocks**: Large, rounded rocks and boulders frame the lower left and right foreground as well as the immediate left side near the zebra's legs.\n- **Pond/Water**: A naturalistic edge pond occupies the lower right and central part of the image, reflecting the zebra’s head, neck, and stripes in the water.\n- **Ground**: The area surrounding the pond consists of light, sandy, barren soil with scattered small rocks.\n- **Background Fence**: Behind the zebra, a dark brown or black horizontal fence with wire runs spans the background, segmenting the image horizontally.\n- **Other Background Elements**: Additional large boulders and rocks are situated in the upper right and center-right background.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- **Zebra**:\n  - **Stripes**: Alternating black and white stripes (well-defined, no blending or feathering). Each stripe follows the form of the zebra’s body—horizontal on the torso, vertical/curving downward on the neck and head, circular on the rump, and diagonal on the legs.\n  - **Hooves**: Solid dark color.\n  - **Mane**: Short, upright, black mane following the curve of the top of the neck.\n  - **Tail**: Thin and tapering, ending in a tuft of black hair.\n- **Rocks**: Muted grey and beige tones, with soft, rounded contours, giving a weathered and natural appearance. Minimal texture (smooth, slight irregularities).\n- **Water**: Pale, reflective surface with muted blue-grey and greenish hues. The water is still, producing a relatively clear reflection of the zebra and some surrounding rocks.\n- **Ground**: Sandy tan/cream color with scattered small rocks and minimal green vegetation.\n- **Fence**: Dark brown/black horizontal slats with three visible horizontal metal/wire rods.\n- **Overall Tone**: Muted and subdued colors, giving a soft, naturalistic, and almost monochromatic appearance (except for zebra stripes).\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- **Zebra**: Dominates the left to center part of the image, angled diagonally from upper left to lower center-right, with its head and muzzle pointing toward the pond (slightly right of center).\n- **Zebra’s Reflection**: Clearly visible in the pond beneath the zebra, mirroring its head, neck, and front legs.\n- **Rocks**:\n  - Foreground (left): Large boulder at lower left corner, behind and to the left of the zebra’s raised front leg.\n  - Middle ground (right): Lower edge of one large rock in the lower right, some visible at pond edge.\n  - Background: Multiple rocks and boulders to the right and rear of the zebra, both near the pond and extending to the upper right.\n- **Pond**: Takes up the lower right half/quadrant, edge is irregular and organic, extending up to the zebra’s hooves.\n- **Fence**: Occupies the entire upper background, parallel to image top edge, about 1/6th down from the top, separating the animal enclosure from a deeper, slightly blurred background.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- **Photorealistic**: The image is photographically realistic, with natural proportions and lighting.\n- **Mild Desaturation**: The palette is slightly desaturated, producing a natural but subdued and slightly softened look.\n- **Clarity/Focus**: The zebra, foreground rocks, and pond are sharply in focus. Background fence is slightly blurred, giving subtle depth of field.\n- **Lighting**: Diffused sunlight or overcast conditions—no harsh shadows. Soft, even lighting.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n- **Watermarks**: There are repeating semi-transparent ‘a’ characters distributed across the image, and a semi-transparent “alamy” text watermark appears in several places (center right, lower right, lower left). There is also a code in the bottom right: “Image ID: PPWORN”.\n- **Zebra Proportions**:\n  - **Body**: Approximately 3 to 3.5 times as long as the head.\n  - **Legs**: Long and slender, the front right knee is sharply bent, placing the hoof just above pond edge.\n  - **Head**: Triangle-shaped in profile, muzzle just touching water, eye visible.\n  - **Tail**: Extends back parallel to the body axis about three-quarters the torso length.\n- **Fence Details**: Consists of vertical posts and horizontal slats (possibly 3 or 4 slats), with three thin, equally spaced wire or cable lines running horizontally in front of slats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Composition:**\n- The zebra (main subject) is positioned from left center diagonally toward pond (right of center), drinking. Large foreground rocks form the corner and left border. Reflective pond fills the lower right. Fence creates a horizontal barrier in upper background, with rough, scattered rocks throughout the scene. Zebra’s stripes provide the central pattern and focal point with its reflection as a secondary visual anchor.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions for SVG Recreation:**\n- Use layered polygons for rocks and ground.\n- Draw zebra with grouped paths: separate path groups for black stripes, white base, head, body, legs, mane, tail.\n- Use a semi-transparent gradient or mirrored path for the zebra’s reflection.\n- Fence as rectangles and lines, with appropriate proportions and spacing.\n- Text watermarks and image ID as overlayed SVG text, using a semi-transparent fill and a simple sans-serif font. \n\nLet me know if you need geometric breakdowns for each element or further SVG abstraction!",
  "v1_112": "Certainly, here is a detailed and precise description of the image with an emphasis on elements necessary for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main objects, shapes, and elements:**  \n- Foreground: Two human figures dominate the foreground. One person (Person A, on the left) is carrying another (Person B) piggyback style.\n    - Person A is standing with their back slightly angled toward the viewer, chest facing right.\n    - Person B is on Person A’s back, arms draped over Person A's shoulders and chest, and their body turned slightly leftward.\n- Background: A beach landscape, featuring sand in the lower portion, ocean waves in the middle, and sky in the upper section.\n- Horizon line: Approximately one-third from the bottom, dividing the sand and sea from the sky.\n- Sun: Brightly shining, almost aligned with the heads of the main figures, creating a backlit, radiant effect with strong highlights and lens flare.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, textures, and visual properties:**  \n- **Sand:** Light beige to pale tan, with a smooth, matte texture that shows faint footprints and subtle shadow gradients.\n- **Ocean:** Layers of blue — deep cerulean to turquoise in the foreground, receding to paler blue and white where surf meets shore. Waves are topped with shimmering, irregular white highlights, and wet portions of sand reflect marine blue.\n- **Sky:** Gradient from pale blue at the horizon (washed out by direct sunlight) to deeper blue toward the top. The sunlight creates a bright, glowing spot with soft, radial fadeout and a few streaks radiating outward.\n- **People:**  \n    - Clothing: Casual. Person A wears a pale, near-white shirt; Person B wears a light brown or camel tone top.\n    - Skin and hair:  \n        - Person A: Has short, dark hair.\n        - Person B: Has voluminous, curly hair with dark and auburn hues, dynamically splayed by motion and the breeze.\n    - Arms and hands: Natural skin tones; subtle muscle and shadow contours.\n- **Lighting:** Strong backlighting from the sun. Rim highlights outline the figures, especially hair and shoulders. Shadows project forward on the sand, subtly visible.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning:**  \n- Person A is located just left of the center horizontally and stands upright with slightly bent forward posture under the weight of Person B.\n- Person B is aligned slightly to the right of Person A, arms over Person A's shoulders and their legs looping at A’s sides with knees bent.\n- Both figures are roughly one third up from the bottom and occupy about the central two-thirds of the image’s width.\n- The ocean starts approximately at the figures’ lower back/hips and recedes diagonally toward the left horizon.\n- The sun’s center is positioned slightly above and between both heads, its brightest part flaring over their upper bodies.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics:**  \n- **Photorealistic:** The image strives for a natural, lifelike portrayal, with accurate shadowing, nuanced color gradients, and real-world proportions.\n- **Dynamic energy:** There is implied motion — Person B is being given a piggyback. Loose hair flying and natural body positions convey activity and intimacy.\n- **Atmosphere:** Backlighting imbues the scene with warmth, glow, and a high-contrast effect: light edges on hair, clothing, and shoulders, with some parts in soft, diffuse shadow.\n- **Focus:** Depth of field is moderate — the figures and immediate foreground sand are sharp, while the sea and background are visualized with a slight softness.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, symbols, or specific details:**  \n- **No visible text or symbols** are present in the image.\n- **Detailed effects:**  \n    - Highlights: Sunlight creates a notable flare, especially over the heads and hair, forming semi-transparent white to pale yellow streaks and orbs.\n    - Shadows: Soft-edged, forward-projected from the figures' feet on the sand.\n    - Clothing details: Short sleeves, basic shirt silhouettes with natural folds and mild wrinkling.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric details and proportions for accurate SVG recreation:**  \n- **Figures:** Each body occupies about 40-45% of the image height. \n    - Person A: Torso vertically upright, arms bent supporting Person B, legs straight with feet about shoulder-width apart.\n    - Person B: Arms bent around Person A’s shoulders, back arched, legs bent at 90-120 degrees, knees projecting outward.\n- **Horizon line:** Sits about 28-33% from the image's bottom.\n- **Sun:** Place a large soft white-to-yellow radial gradient approximately 55-60% from the left edge and just above the figures’ headtops, with radius expanding to 15-20% of the image’s diagonal.\n- **Ocean:** Use broad, undulating arcs for waves and foam, decreasing in frequency and amplitude with distance from bottom.\n- **Hair of Person B:** Curved, loose, individually drawn lines with random distribution and slight rightward drift due to wind.\n- **Hand and arm positions:** Person B’s arms rest across upper chest/shoulder area of Person A, with visible hands gripping.\n\n---\n\nIf recreating as SVG, focus on layered objects for:  \n- Sand (bottom), then ocean (mid-layer), then figures (top layer), with their distinctive shapes and orientation.  \n- Use a large soft radial gradient for the sunlight and add semi-transparent, irregular ellipses for lens flare.  \n- Distinguish clothing and hair with multipath shapes for naturalistic, layered effect.  \n- Shadows: use soft, diffuse ovals on the sand, below and just ahead of the feet.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need schematic sketches or further breakdown of body geometry or background elements!",

  "v1_121": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description of the image, focusing on the elements needed for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n\n- **The Plate:**  \n  - Large, round plate, positioned centrally and slightly tilted to the right (viewer’s perspective).\n  - The plate is depicted as a classic ellipse (~3:2 aspect ratio due to perspective), with the rim visible.\n  - The plate is mostly empty, containing only small remnants/scraps of food.\n\n- **The Fork:**  \n  - A metal, standard dining fork lies nearly horizontally across the plate, from left (handle end) to right (tine end).\n  - The fork is centered horizontally across the plate, but its handle slightly extends beyond the right edge of the plate.\n  - The handle is on the right side, tines pointing to the left.\n  - The fork has a reflective, silvery appearance, four tines, and gently curves (with a wider handle tapering to a thinner neck near the tines).\n\n- **Food Remnants:**\n  - Scattered, irregularly shaped small scraps of food are left on the plate, mostly beige/light brown, with crumbs and some slightly stringy textures.\n  - The food bits are distributed unevenly, with clusters concentrated closer to the upper left (plate’s surface).\n\n- **Table Surface:**\n  - The plate rests on a rough, wooden surface with visible, irregular grain and edge patterns.\n  - The wood is a mixture of medium brown and grayish tones, with organic, natural textures.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n\n- **Plate:**\n  - Dominant, solid medium-red color.\n  - Glossy finish, reflecting light (shows faint highlights and light reflections on the surface).\n  - Some subtle, circular surface scratches/usage marks visible, following the plate’s curvature.\n- **Fork:**\n  - Metallic silver/gray, slightly reflective.\n  - Subtle shading along the fork to indicate the 3D form and slight curvature.\n- **Food Remnants:**\n  - Vary from off-white to light beige and brown.\n  - Irregular shapes (crumbs, strings, tiny lumps).\n- **Table:**\n  - Variegated brown and beige, with organic, irregular wood grain textures.\n  - Edges of the wood are jagged and uneven.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- **Plate:**  \n  - Plate occupies about 60% of the image width, nearly centered horizontally but slightly shifted to the left.\n  - The angle of perspective shows the bottom right rim closer/larger, the top left rim further/smaller (foreshortening).\n- **Fork:**  \n  - Placed across the upper half of the plate, at a slight diagonal (handle is higher/right, tines lower/left).\n  - The fork’s handle extends a bit over the plate’s right edge.\n- **Food Remnants:**  \n  - Scattered primarily in the upper left quadrant of the plate, with a few near the center and bottom rim.\n- **Table:**  \n  - Takes up the background beneath the plate, with plate’s left edge overlapping the wood’s darker, thicker section; right edge closer to a brighter, thinner area.\n  - The wood's grain lines and edge are visible and organic, not straight.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic Style:**  \n  - The image is a photo, but for SVG, focus on clean, simple shapes with gradients to suggest gloss.\n  - Use ellipses for the plate, thin rectangles/tapered paths for the fork.\n  - Abstract/crude polygons for food remnants, with color fills and minimal outlines.\n- **Shadow and Highlight:**  \n  - Include a soft drop shadow to suggest the plate’s contact with the table.\n  - Subtle inner highlights following the plate’s elliptical rim; a lighter arc on the upper right (to give gloss/shine).\n  - Fork has shading along its length, and faint shadows under the tines.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n\n- **Text:**\n  - No visible text on the plate, fork, or table.\n  - Ignore the Shutterstock watermark and code at the bottom for SVG recreation.\n- **Specific Details:**\n  - Plate rim: slightly raised, should be indicated with a narrow elliptical ring inside the main ellipse.\n  - Fork tines: four short, equally spaced parallel rectangles; handle may have a simple decorative motif or subtle ingrained line.\n  - Table grain: use wavy paths, not regular lines, to represent wood.\n\n---\n\n### **Geometric/Proportional Summary for SVG:**\n\n- Plate main ellipse: Center at (50%, 58%) of canvas; width ~60%, height ~40%\n- Plate rim: Inner ellipse ~8% smaller on all sides; offset concentrically.\n- Fork:  \n  - Length ~56% of plate’s major axis  \n  - Width at handle ~7% of fork length, narrowing to ~4% at neck\n  - Angle: ~12 degrees off horizontal (handle higher right)\n- Fork tines: 4 prongs, each ~9% of fork length, spacing ~1% fork length\n- Food bits: 6-8 irregular, small shapes, scatter-concentrated on upper left quadrant\n- Shadows:\n  - Plate shadow: offset ~5% below and left of plate; soft blur, dark brown\n  - Fork shadow: short, dark gray/blue, under tines/handle only\n- Wood edges: Irregular polygons, not rectangles; have wavy outlines\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nA large, glossy red elliptical plate sits tilted on a rough, tan-brown wooden surface. Across the upper half of the plate is a silver four-tined fork, with the handle pointing right and just overhanging the rim. The plate is mostly empty, except for a few scattered beige food crumbs and stringy remnants, most of which are near the upper left. The scene is well-lit, showing gentle reflections on the red glaze and fork, with textured, organic wood grain beneath and around the plate.\n\n---\n\nIf you need any elements described in yet more precise SVG terms (e.g., path commands), let me know!",

  "v1_127": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and accurate description of the image (excluding the blurred face):\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Parrot**: The central object in the foreground is a parrot perched on a human hand. The parrot is viewed mostly from the side, showing its back, wing, and part of its side. The beak and head are partially visible, with the head angled toward the hand.\n- **Human Hand**: The hand holding the parrot is visible in the lower center of the image. The fingers are gently curled, with one finger extended for the parrot to grasp.\n- **Background**: The background is a uniform blur of green, suggestive of foliage or an outdoor natural environment, providing a contrast to the more sharply focused foreground elements.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Parrot**:\n  - **Wings & Back**: Bright green with areas of blue and yellow, showing layered feathers with a scaly texture.\n  - **Lower Body & Underwing**: The underside is a deeper blue with hints of red, particularly near the edge and lower side of the bird.\n  - **Neck**: The bird’s neck has a pattern of thin, alternating black and white or gray stripes.\n  - **Foot**: Perched on the finger, the parrot’s visible foot is dark gray, scaly, and gripping with visible claws.\n- **Hand**: Light skin tone, smooth texture, natural shading. The extended index finger is aligned horizontally for the parrot to perch on.\n- **Background**: Varying shades of green, softly blurred, giving a smooth gradient effect typical of shallow depth-of-field photography.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Parrot**: Occupies the left half and center of the image, with its head angled toward the right. Its body is diagonally oriented from the bottom left (tail) upward to the right (head).\n- **Hand**: Emerges from the bottom of the frame, positioned centrally. The finger with the parrot is horizontal and centrally aligned, partially supporting the bird.\n- **Background**: Extends across the entire image, no other discrete objects are visible, ensuring focus remains on the bird and hand.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealism**: The image is a photograph, rendered with sharp focus on the parrot and the hand, contrasted against a smooth blurred background (bokeh effect). The color palette is vivid, especially in the parrot’s feathers.\n- **Depth of Field**: The strong separation between foreground (parrot, hand) and the diffused background creates an emphasis on the subject and imparts a three-dimensional quality.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **No visible text or symbols** appear in the image.\n- **Feather Details**: Distinct overlapping feather shapes outlined in darker tones, giving a layered effect especially on the wing.\n- **Finger Details**: Natural anatomical details, slight curves in the knuckles and joints, fingernail clearly visible.\n- **Parrot's Stripe Pattern**: On the neck, fine, almost zigzagging pattern, high contrast compared to the adjacent colorful feathers.\n- **No accessories or clothing details** are strongly visible except for a possible blue collar or top at the base of the neck.\n\n---\n\n### Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout\n\n- **Parrot**: Occupies roughly 60% of the image horizontally. Body: horizontally elongated oval (~50% image width), tail extending slightly down-left. Head takes up upper center, duller in color near the beak. The wing feathers cover about 2/3 of the bird’s side, distinguished by curved lines indicating feather boundaries.\n- **Hand**: Positioned centrally, with the index finger extended horizontally, parallel to the lower border of the image. The visible knuckle is below the bird’s feet; finger width is about 1/10th the image width.\n- **Arrangement**: The hand and parrot are centrally aligned, with the hand at the bottom center and the bird perched directly above, slightly angled. Negative space (background) surrounds them, especially on the right and upper edges.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Layout for SVG Reproduction:**\n\n- **Main horizontal axis**: Parrot’s body, ~45° diagonal from lower left to upper right.\n- **Hand**: Center-bottom, finger extends horizontally.\n- **Parrot’s size**: Approx. 6x the length of the finger it's perched on.\n- **Feather details**: Layered, scalloped arcs for wings/back, smaller fan shapes for neck and head.\n- **Background**: Uniform blurred green, gradient or soft-noise fill.\n- **No non-organic elements, no text or geometric symbols.**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further breakdowns or technical sketches!",

  "v1_130": "Certainly. Here is a comprehensive description of the image, excluding any mention of the blurred face:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- **Elephant:** The central element is a large Asian elephant depicted in profile, facing left. The elephant is shown mid-stride, with its front left leg forward and trunk hanging down almost to the ground. Its ears are broad and slightly fanned out, typical of the species, and it features a distinctive dome-shaped forehead.\n- **Person:** Seated on the elephant's upper back/neck area, straddling the animal. The person is sitting upright with legs bent at the knees, hands resting on their legs or lightly holding a strap.\n- **Harness/Saddle:** There is a padded, rectangular seat (likely with a wooden frame, dark brown in color) set on a woven mat covering part of the elephant’s back, secured with ropes. Additional rope harnessing circles the elephant’s belly and extends to a chain trailing to the right background.\n- **Flags:** In the right background, two vertical flags are visible—one with horizontal stripes of red, white, and blue, and another solid yellow flag.\n- **Background Elements:** The background shows lush greenery—trees with dense, leafy foliage and visible trunks. There's also a river behind the elephant, with reflections visible on the water's surface, and a strip of light brown/green grassy shore.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Elephant:** The skin is a textured, wrinkled gray with subtle highlights and shadows suggesting three-dimensional form and muscle structure.\n- **Person:** The figure wears a deep blue, loose-fitting garment (shirt and pants) and a large-brimmed, woven straw hat in ochre/beige tones.\n- **Harness/Saddle:** The seat is a mix of dark browns and black (mat and fringe), with the ropes/harness mainly tan and light brown.\n- **Flags:** The leftmost flag (Thailand) has horizontal stripes: red (top and bottom), white (mid-upper/mid-lower), with a central blue stripe. The yellow flag is plain and bright.\n- **Background/Environment:** The greenery is a mix of different shades of green, with some lighter yellow-greens where sunlight penetrates. The river is a muted brownish-green, reflecting the trees. The ground under the elephant is textured dirt, with splotches of dampness near its feet.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Foreground:** The elephant is centrally placed, occupying the majority of image height and width. The person sits slightly forward of the elephant’s mid-back.\n- **Middle Ground:** The river runs horizontally behind the elephant, with a small percentage of the riverbank visible.\n- **Background:** Trees frame the left and back of the image, with clustered foliage at different heights. The flags are positioned mid-right, emerging from the riverbank and extending up to the upper third of the image.\n- **Proportions:** The elephant’s body occupies about 65% of the image width and 80% of the image height. The person is about 1/6 the length of the elephant.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The image is realistic, photographic, and high-resolution, emphasizing natural light. Textures and shading are detailed and true to life. There is no stylization or abstraction; instead, focus is on lifelike rendering, soft natural color gradations, and realistic proportions.\n\n**5. Any Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- **Flags:** The left flag features the distinct pattern of the Thai national flag (horizontal stripes: red, white, blue, white, red from top to bottom). The yellow flag to its right appears solid, perhaps signifying local or royal symbolism.\n- **Straps/Saddle:** The seat is detailed with a fringe, rectangular in shape (~3:1 width-to-height proportion), attached securely with visible knotted ropes.\n- **Ground:** The base is an irregular oval of packed earth, with small puddles and texture indicating a well-trodden path or arena.\n- **Trees:** The trees have jagged trunks and lacy-edged leaves, depicted with intricate, high-detail branching.\n\n**Geometric & Layout Details for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Elephant:** Large ellipse (body) with four slightly tapering vertical rectangles for legs, rounded rectangle for the trunk. Ears are semicircular, flare out just above eye level. Tail is a thin, curved line ending in a brush.\n- **Person:** Rectangular torso, cylindrical limbs, hat as a wide ellipse on top of an oval/head.\n- **Saddle/harness:** Rectangle with series of parallel lines (straps), semicircle for mat fringe.\n- **Flags:** Thin vertical lines for poles, right triangles or rectangles for flag shapes.\n- **River/Background:** Horizontal band for water, large shaded areas behind for trees, with leaf clusters as irregular polygons or cloud-like shapes.\n- **Proportions:** Elephant should be about 5–6 times wider than the person's torso. The flags are approximately as tall as the elephant’s back reference point.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides the detailed, geometric, compositional, and stylistic information needed for a precise SVG recreation of the scene.",
  "v1_131": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive description of the image excluding the blurred face:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Surfer**: Central figure in the image. The person is crouched in a dynamic posture, knees bent, with the right arm extended forward and left arm bent and raised. The upper body leans slightly forward.\n- **Surfboard**: White, elongated, and slightly oval-shaped surfboard under the surfer, angled upwards at the nose, with clear geometric symmetry. The tail is submerged under the right foot.\n- **Wave**: Curved crest of an aquamarine wave supporting the surfboard. The wave forms a gentle arc from right to left, with white water spray in the middle and left of the surfer.\n- **Water Surface**: The lower portion of the image features rippling water, with a mix of smooth and turbulent texture from the surfer’s movement.\n- **Background**: Upper part is filled with a horizontal, out-of-focus dark gray element, possibly a wall or embankment; above the waterline.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

  "v1_133": "Certainly! Here is a detailed description of the image for precise SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Tree Stump:** Central and most prominent object in the foreground, to the right of center. The stump is a cylinder with a rough, cracked texture on its bark. The top surface is irregular, slightly hollowed, showing remnants of cut concentric tree rings, and darkened cracks.\n- **Young Shoots/Sprouts:** Several leafy, slender plants are growing from around the base of the stump and slightly to the left. The tallest of these plants nearly reaches the height of the stump. These shoots are characterized by thin vertical and diagonal stems, each adorned with almond-shaped green leaves, arranged alternately or oppositely.\n- **Grass and Weeds:** The ground is covered with clumps of grass. There's a section in the bottom-left corner where the grass is sparse, revealing dry, brownish soil and mulch with some green shoots.\n- **Background Fence:** A wooden picket fence forms the full backdrop. It's constructed with vertical planks and a horizontal board at the base and upper-middle. The top edges of each picket are cut into points (picket style).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Stump:**\n    - **Color:** Bark is a mix of grayish brown, beige, and hints of yellowish lichen/moss, particularly in the bark fissures. The top surface is slightly lighter, with dark cracks.\n    - **Texture:** Deeply fissured and rugged bark; cracked and decayed contours dominate the top surface.\n- **Shoots/Sprouts:**\n    - **Color:** Stems are reddish-brown and leaves are vibrant green, with some yellowish tints in sunlight.\n    - **Texture:** Leaves are smooth and slightly glossy.\n- **Grass:**\n    - **Colors:** Varying shades of green, from dark at the base to yellow-green tips, with brownish dead patches.\n    - **Texture:** Thin, stringy blades and some broader-leafed weeds.\n- **Fence:**\n    - **Color:** Light brown wood—weathered and sun-bleached, with faint vertical grain patterns and knots visible.\n    - **Texture:** Smooth but slightly irregular surface, with shadows and changes in tone from sun exposure.\n- **Lighting:** Strong sunlight, casting crisp shadows, particularly to the left of the stump and plants.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Stump:** Slightly right of center, occupies about 1/5 of image width at its widest, extending almost from the bottom edge to halfway up the height.\n- **Shoots:** Clustered primarily at the base of the stump, some leaning left, extending upwards to about the top of the stump, and spreading wider at the base.\n- **Grass and Ground:** Covers the bottom quarter of the image, except for the central area surrounding the stump where there’s a patch of brown, with less grass, showing the earth.\n- **Fence:** Runs horizontally across the entire background, spanning the full width, occupying the upper half of the image. The bottom edge of the fence is about 1/4 from the bottom of the image, positioning it just behind the plants and stump.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photographic realism.** The elements are highly naturalistic, with detailed textures and organic line work.\n- **Lighting:** Clear, directional sunlight from the upper left, resulting in strong shadow contrast.\n- **Composition:** Central focus on stump and new life (shoots) juxtaposed with orderly, manmade fence in the background.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n\n- **Text/Symbols:** There are no visible textual elements, symbols, or markings.\n- **Notable Details:**\n    - The top of the stump is irregular, not a perfect circle, with a slightly “cratered” middle.\n    - Faint yellow lichen patches on the bark.\n    - Fence posts have pointed tops and are regularly spaced. The pickets have visible wood grain and knots.\n    - Shadows of the vertical pickets fall onto the lower horizontal piece, visible as narrow rectangles.\n    - Small yellow dandelion flower near the cluster of shoots in the lower-left quadrant.\n    - The area around the base of the stump is a mix of broad and narrow leaves, weeds, and brown mulch.\n\n---\n\n### GEOMETRIC/PROPORTIONAL INFO FOR SVG RECREATION\n\n- **Stump:** \n    - Place center at 65% width, 62% height; ellipse/cylinder 20% total width, 40% height.\n    - Use irregular polygonal/elliptical path for top; bark pattern as a jagged, randomized border.\n- **Shoots:**\n    - Stems: thin ~2px paths, several at 40-80° angles.\n    - Leaves: ovate paths approx 10-20px length, alternate along stems.\n    - Tallest shoot nearly matches stump's height.\n    - Denser at bottom-left of stump, sparser to the right.\n- **Fence:**\n    - Series of vertical rectangles (~7% width, 50% height each), spaced with ~1/3 width gaps.\n    - Picket tops: two-sided sawtooth on each picket.\n    - Two long horizontal rectangles for rails (one near base, one mid-point of fence).\n- **Ground:**\n    - Lower 25%: densely filled with vertical grass blade lines and clumps, patch of irregular, brown area (mulch/soil) at the central base below/facing stump.\n- **Lighting/Shadow:**\n    - Add leftward shadow for stump (skewed, semi-transparent black or dark gray).\n    - Fence projects vertical bar shadows forward and downward onto grass.\n\n---\n\nIf you need additional guidance on layering, grouping, or color referencing, please specify!",

  "v1_139": "Certainly—here is a thorough and detailed description optimized for SVG recreation purposes:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n\n- **Foreground (Lower Third):**\n  - A concrete sidewalk (light gray, smooth texture) runs vertically from bottom-center toward top-center, gradually tapering as it recedes in depth. The sidewalk is about one-fourth the width of the image at the bottom and narrows to about one-twentieth at the top.\n  - Several figures (people) in dark clothing are walking on the sidewalk, clustered primarily in the lower third. There are at least five figures prominent here: three adults (two women, one man) and two children.\n  - The group is holding different objects: one person is holding a bouquet of flowers with yellow and white hues; another holds a rectangular green box.\n  - To their right (viewer’s left), stretches a wide, green grassy lawn occupying the left half of the frame; to their left (viewer’s right), is a narrower strip of grass bordering the street.\n\n- **Midground (Middle Third):**\n  - The sidewalk continues straight up, flanked on both sides by green lawns.\n  - Additional figures—group of six, also dressed in dark formal clothing—walk toward the foreground, also on the sidewalk.\n  - Off to the left, a blacktop driveway curves from the street toward a large car (pale beige, classic boxy sedan) parked near a bush and partially under a tree.\n\n- **Background (Upper Third):**\n  - The sidewalk terminates at the street, which runs horizontally from the left edge to the right edge of the image, forming the background’s primary horizontal division.\n  - A row of cars is parked along the right curb, with varied colors (gray, green, dark blue, black).\n  - The far background reveals additional people, trees with autumn foliage, more cars, and houses set back from the street.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n\n- **Grass:** Vivid, well-kept green with patches of sunlight and shadow, a natural, slightly uneven texture.\n- **Sidewalk:** Light gray, smooth, clear sharp edges against the grass.\n- **People:** Predominantly black or dark navy attire (long coats, hats, formal dresses, and suits), some lighter accents (e.g., white collars, bouquet of flowers).\n- **Cars:** Range from pale beige and silver (foreground and driveway) to green, black, and blue (background/curb).\n- **Other Details:** Bouquets add splashes of yellow, orange, and white. Shadows are soft and elongated, indicating afternoon or morning light.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- Sidewalk is central and forms the main axis, with people arrayed in clusters along this axis.\n- Lawns sit on both sides of the sidewalk, with the larger portion to the left.\n- Driveway splits off from the sidewalk to the viewer's left, creating a strong curve leading to a car.\n- Parked cars line the street on the right, creating a receding perspective and deepening the sense of space.\n- People are distributed in two main groups: one in the foreground, one in the midground, both walking toward the camera.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- Realistic, photographic rendering with natural lighting.\n- Slightly muted, somber color palette emphasizing greens, grays, blacks, and subtle highlights.\n- Depth is conveyed by converging sidewalk edges, scale reduction, and increasingly lighter background tones.\n- The arrangement is formal and slightly symmetrical due to the centered sidewalk and receding perspective lines.\n\n**5. Any Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n\n- No explicit text or symbols present.\n- Vehicles have state license plates, but they are not legible.\n- The bouquets are distinctly detailed—one with a spray of small flowers in orange and yellow tones, another with yellow.\n- The rectangular green box features a subtle border or clasp, held by one person.\n- The positioning and postures suggest a somber procession or formal occasion, reinforced by coordinated dark attire.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric/Layout Guidance for SVG Recreation:**\n\n- **Image Dimensions**: Use a 16:9 ratio, e.g., 1920x1080px.\n- **Sidewalk**: Central. At bottom (0px, 0px) width ≈ 25% canvas width; narrows toward top center (~90% y), to width ≈ 5%.\n- **Driveway**: Begins halfway up the canvas at left edge of sidewalk, curves up and left to mid-top left, ending in a rectangle for sedan.\n- **Lawns**: Large polygonal areas of green with subtle color gradients, main lawn left, narrow lawn right.\n- **Street**: Top 1/3rd, horizontal gray rectangle/band, with cars parked at repeating intervals.\n- **Figure Clusters**: Two main groups, aligned and scaled according to perspective.\n- **Cars**: Simple rectangles/rounded rectangles with ellipse wheels, grouped at right and one prominently left.\n- **Lighting**: Add a yellowish patch on the left lawn for sunlight/shadow; soft shadowing beneath figures and vehicles.\n\nThis precise composition, spatial, and color data should permit a faithful SVG recreation of the scene.",

  "v1_153": "Certainly! Here is a highly detailed and precise description of the image, focusing on geometric and compositional details for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- **A cartoon rhinoceros** stands at the left, facing mostly right, holding a painter’s palette in its left hand and a paintbrush in its right, poised at a canvas on an easel.\n- **The easel and canvas** stand just right of the rhino. The canvas shows a painting: a pointed conical hill and a yellow-orange sky.\n- **The landscape** features grassy green terrain, a rounded conical mound or inselberg (hill) at mid-distance, lone acacia-like trees, and a gentle mountain range at the horizon.\n- **Three paintings** are visible:\n    - **On the easel:** The rhino’s own painting of the landscape, but the hill is depicted as a gigantic rhino horn.\n    - **On the ground, left:** Another canvas or drawing, propped up, also showing a pointed object but in lighter colors.\n    - **On the ground, right:** A painting showing the hill as it actually is (a rounded cone), but still somewhat hornlike.\n- **Art supplies** are scattered: a paint can with two brushes, a blob of red paint, and a palette.\n- **Text** at the bottom in large white sans-serif font on solid black: *“You see the world as you are!”*\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Rhino:** Light gray, with a slightly darker outline and minimal shading. The horn is large, thick, and sharply conical, matching the hill in the background. The eyes are outlined in black, with a gentle, friendly smile. The palette (oval) features dabs of yellow, red, blue, and green paint.\n- **Canvas/Easel:** Canvas is off-white, bordered by a thin wooden brown frame on a tripod easel of dull yellow-brown wood.\n- **Paintings:**\n    - **Canvas painting:** The hill is elongated and sharply conical (like a rhino horn), dominating the center. Orange-yellow sky with smooth blending.\n    - **Left-ground painting:** Fainter, possibly a preliminary sketch, mostly yellow tone with a red element in the corner.\n    - **Right-ground painting:** Similar setting, hill is more rounded, less exaggerated, standard yellow-green coloring and circular sun.\n- **Landscape:** Grassy ground is light-to-medium green, interspersed with tufts and sparse textures. The mound/hill in the scene is pale gray with subtle shadowing. Acacia trees have dark brown trunks and broad, flat, clustered green leaf crowns. Distant mountains are purple and brown, sky is a gradient of orange and yellow with scattered clouds.\n- **Foreground:** Paint can is green with red paint inside; two upright brown-bristled brushes inside. Red paint splotch, palette with visible colored circles, another scattered brush.\n- **Text:** Crisp white, sans-serif, all lowercase.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Rhino:** Stands left of center, front legs and hind legs visible, slightly left-leaning; body occupies left third of image, with the body’s top just below the horizon.\n- **Easel and canvas:** Canvas stands at the same level as rhino’s chest. Angle of the canvas is about 15° tilting back from vertical, with the painting surface facing slightly leftward.\n- **Background:** The painted hill aligns with the real hill in the background, visually suggesting the rhino interprets the hill as a giant horn.\n- **Ground paintings:** Two are lying flatish at the easel’s base—left painting is perpendicular to the easel, right is parallel.\n- **Paint can and brushes:** Left of the easel, close to foreground, with brushes fanning outward.\n- **Other elements:** Tree line and distant hill create horizon at about upper third. Two main acacia trees: rightmost one is tall, near-right, with brown trunk splitting into two, and flat green foliage.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Cartoon style** – exaggerated proportions (large rhino, expressive eyes), thick black outlines, simple gradients and shading for depth.\n- **Comedic/explanatory tone** – rhino appears earnest and friendly, the visual gag plays on the likeness between the horn and the landscape.\n- **Shapes:** Forms are rounded, little sharpness except for the horns and hills. Composition is gentle and inviting, with clear separations and easy-to-follow depth.\n- **Perspective:** Slightly elevated, third-person viewpoint – viewer can see both the scene and be aware of the “illusion” in the painting.\n\n---\n\n**5.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n- **Head Position:** The head shape is centrally aligned in the image, occupying the upper half.\n- **Hair Placement:** The three wavy hairlines start from the top center of the head, varying in direction and arc, stretching into the free space above the head outline.\n- **Text Placement:** Two lines of Chinese text are centered directly below the head. \n  - The first line starts immediately beneath the lowest edge of the black shape, with minimal spacing.\n  - The second line is placed directly beneath the first line, maintaining consistent vertical spacing.\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Overall Style:** The illustration uses a minimal, cartoon-like graphic style. The lines are slightly imperfect, contributing to a hand-drawn look. The absence of shading or intricate detail suggests a focus on expressive simplicity.\n- **Proportions:** \n  - The head/body's width is approximately three-fourths of the total image width.\n  - The semicircular head/body occupies roughly one third of the image height.\n  - The hair extends upwards about one eighth of the image height above the head.\n  - The text together occupies about one fourth of the image height below the primary graphic element.\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n- **Text Content:** Beneath the graphic are two centered lines of Chinese text in a plain, sans-serif font. The characters are bold and black, enhancing clarity and visual balance.\n  - First line: 除了睡觉时间不想睡觉\n  - Second line: 其他时间都想睡觉\n- **Text Layout:** \n  - The text is evenly spaced, with each line centered horizontally relative to the head shape above.\n  - The font size is consistent for both lines, and the weight of the font is medium to bold.\n  - There is a uniform margin between the image and the text block, and between the two lines of text.\n\n---\n\n#### **SVG-Relevant Geometric Summary**\n- **Canvas:** Suggest a square or nearly square aspect ratio.\n- **Head/Body:** Centered black semicircle or oval, bottom aligned horizontally.\n- **Hair:** Three freeform, single-stroke lines (SVG `<path>` elements), varied in length and curve.\n- **Text:** Two stacked, horizontally centered lines, using a standard sans-serif Chinese font (e.g., \"Noto Sans CJK\"), with consistent font size and weight.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides the necessary details for an accurate SVG recreation, capturing all relevant geometric, spatial, and stylistic properties.",
  "v1_156": "Certainly! Here is a detailed, SVG-oriented description of the provided image:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Central Figure:**  \n  The main subject is a stylized panda face, highly abstracted and surreal, occupying nearly the entire image.  \n  The face is mostly white with a bold, exaggerated black mouth area and two solid black eye dots.\n\n- **Ears:**  \n  Two perfectly circular black ears are present at the top left and top right of the image, protruding slightly from the head shape and partially cropped by the image’s frame.\n\n- **Eyes:**  \n  Two small, evenly spaced, perfectly round black dots serve as the eyes. They are positioned horizontally in the upper third of the image and spaced far apart relative to typical facial proportions.\n\n- **Mouth/Nose Area:**  \n  An extremely exaggerated, wide-open mouth dominates the lower half of the face, stretching almost from cheek to cheek. The mouth is rendered as a black oval with an irregular, jagged lower edge suggesting teeth and a tongue inside.  \n  The nose is small, black, and sits immediately above the mouth, shaped as a shallow and slightly curved horizontal line.\n\n- **Overall Head Shape:**  \n  The head is a large, white, semi-oval (almost circular but slightly elongated vertically) that fills most of the canvas.  \n  The head’s outline softly transitions into the white background, making the edge somewhat indistinct, except where interrupted by the black ears or facial features.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Color Palette:**  \n  - White: Dominates the head and background.\n  - Black: Used for both ears, eyes, mouth interior, and nose.\n  - Grayscale Gradient: Slight shadows and soft gradients around the mouth and nose, giving a slightly three-dimensional, photorealistic feel.\n\n- **Texture:**  \n  - The image has an overall smooth, slightly blurred appearance, likely due to image compression and stylization.\n  - The black areas are solid and clean-edged, except for the mouth, which has some fuzziness around the teeth, adding a sense of depth or motion.\n  - The white areas have a faint, soft gradient around the mouth and nose, suggesting volumetric form, but no fur texture is visible.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Ears:**  \n  Positioned symmetrically near the top corners. The left ear (on viewer’s left) is anchored roughly at the top left corner, the right ear at the top right, both cropped slightly by the image border.\n\n- **Eyes:**  \n  Each eye is a circle approximately 1/15th the width of the head; they are positioned horizontally on the upper third line, with about two eye-widths of space between them.\n\n- **Nose & Mouth:**  \n  Nose centered below eyes, small and floating close above the upper edge of the mouth.\n  Mouth is a wide oval—width about 70% of total head width—positioned so its upper edge is below the midpoint.  \n  The mouth’s lower edge extends downward, with squared-off teeth suggested along the top and bottom edges within the black oval.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Style:**  \n  - Highly abstract, meme or surrealist quality.\n  - Mix of geometric and organic forms, but no real sense of fur or panda naturalism.\n  - High-contrast black and white design for maximum visual impact.\n  - Borderline uncanny facial expression with an emotion of surprise or shock.\n\n- **Artistic Characteristics:**  \n  - Overexaggerated facial proportions: very small eyes, enormous mouth.\n  - Minimalist use of features: only simple circles and ovals for main facial elements.\n  - Soft, almost airbrushed shadows on white; harsh, defined black shapes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **No visible text or traditional symbols.**\n- The main facial elements (eyes, nose, mouth) are enough to identify it as a stylized panda but are depicted in a distinctly surreal, humorous, or \"meme\" style.\n- No additional background elements—completely white/blank except for main figure.\n\n---\n\n## Geometric and Proportional Notes for SVG Reproduction\n\n- **Canvas:** Square or near-square (use 1:1 aspect for SVG, e.g., 500x500).\n- **Head:**  \n  - Centered, ellipse or circle, occupying ~90% width and height.\n- **Ears:**  \n  - Left: centered at (approx. 17%, 14%) of canvas, radius ~18% of width.\n  - Right: centered at (approx. 83%, 14%), same radius.\n\n- **Eyes:**  \n  - Left: centered at (approx. 37%, 29%), radius ~3.5%.\n  - Right: centered at (approx. 63%, 29%), radius ~3.5%.\n\n- **Nose:**  \n  - Centered at (50%, 41%), width ~10%, height ~5%, shallow ellipse or curved line.\n\n- **Mouth:**  \n  - Centered at (50%, 62%).\n  - Width: ~70% canvas width; height: ~36%.\n  - Upper and lower borders of mouth have irregular/jagged edges for 'teeth' feel, but in SVG may be rendered as a path with shallow, irregular undulations or as a black oval with white rectangles overlayed for teeth.\n\n- **Shading:**  \n  - Subtle soft gray around the mouth’s perimeter to suggest relief.\n  - No solid outlines on the head; only on facial features.\n\n---\n\nThis descriptive breakdown should provide all geometric, proportional, and stylistic information necessary for a precise and accurate SVG recreation of the image.",
  "v1_157": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description of the image to guide SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- **Cat Head**: The primary object is a close-up view of a cat’s head in a slightly upward-facing orientation.\n- **Mouth**: The cat's mouth is heavily stylized—wide open into an oval or circle shape occupying almost a third of the face, exaggerated in size.\n- **Text**: Inside the mouth, there is white Chinese text (字符: \"妈！\", meaning \"Mom!\" in English).\n- **Tears**: There are stylized blue tear streaks emanating diagonally downward from both of the cat’s eyes.\n- **Ears**: Both ears are visible, with the left ear (from the viewer’s perspective) being larger and more forward than the right.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Color Palette**: \n  - The cat is primarily white with some black patches (especially the ears and above the eyes).\n  - The mouth interior is a very dark brown, almost black, with snippets of lighter edges (indicating lips/fur and inner mouth).\n  - Tears are a bright, sky blue.\n  - The background is a muted, neutral beige or light gray.\n- **Textures**: \n  - The fur is rendered smoothly but with enough detail to suggest softness.\n  - The inside of the mouth is flatly shaded, with subtle gradients along the lips and a faint hint of a tongue at the bottom.\n- **Eyes**: The eyes are squinted or closed, with black lines indicating eyelids, giving an impression of distress or crying.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Cat Head**: Takes up almost the entire square frame, tightly cropped so the top of the head and both ears nearly touch the image boundaries.\n- **Mouth**: Centered horizontally and placed slightly below the mid-height of the face.\n- **Text**: The Chinese character is perfectly centered within the black mouth oval.\n- **Tears**: Six to eight short blue lines per eye, with each streak forming a 15-30 degree angle beneath the eyes, indicating rapid movement or intense emotion.\n- **Ears**: The left ear is fully visible and upright, the right ear is partially cropped by the image boundary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Photomanipulation/Internet Meme Style**: \n  - The base is a photo of a real cat, but the mouth and tears are digitally exaggerated for comedic effect.\n  - The mouth is unnaturally large, out of proportion for humorous emphasis.\n  - Tears are drawn in a cartoonish style, contrasting with the photographic realism of the cat itself.\n- **Expressive**: The image is designed for maximum emotional expression, specifically a wailing/crying look.\n- **Overlay Text**: The Chinese character is bold, sans-serif (resembling Microsoft YaHei or other common Chinese sans fonts), and placed with high contrast.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- **Text**: \"妈！\" in white, large, centered, slightly above the mouth’s horizontal centerline.\n- **Mouth Geometry**: A near-perfect oval with a minor horizontal stretch, occupying roughly 45% of the image width and 35% of the image height, vertically centered on the lower third of the face.\n- **Tear Drops/Lines**:\n  - Each tear is a short blue arc or line (4–6px length, 2px thick for SVG). They curve slightly outward.\n  - Tears are not symmetrical, but roughly mirrored in count and placement.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary for SVG Reconstruction**\n- **Canvas**: Square.\n- **Cat Head**: Large, mostly white oval shape, with two triangle ears (left: completely upright, right: cropped).\n- **Patch Details**: Black triangle inside both ears, black-brown patch above/between the eyes.\n- **Mouth**: Large, centered dark oval, slight reddish-pink hue on the edges, white text (\"妈！\") centered inside.\n- **Tears**: Multiple short blue curved lines radiating from just below the eyes.\n- **Eyes**: Represented as curved lines (closed, squinting)—black or very dark.\n\n---\n\nIf you need further mathematical precision (pixel or percent positions/sizes for rectangles, ovals, etc.), let me know!",
  "v1_158": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description of the image suitable for precise SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The image depicts a bowl of creamy soup, prominently featuring slices of mushrooms, small cubes of another ingredient (likely onion or potato), and bits of herbs/greens in a brownish-tan broth.\n- The main vessel is a round bowl with a distinct, moderately thick rim. The bowl is seen from an overhead or slightly oblique angle, showing approximately two-thirds of its opening.\n- The soup surface is uneven, with ingredient pieces showing varying degrees of submersion.\n- The background is a medium-brown wood surface (table) visible outside the bowl primarily on the right side.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- **Soup Base:** The broth is a warm, light brown (tan) with a creamy visual texture, appearing smooth but marked by tiny flecks (likely herbs/spices).\n- **Mushrooms:** Varying shades of tan and light brown, with some slices showing darker cooked edges. Their surfaces are matte, with a few shiny, light-reflecting spots indicating moisture.\n- **Herbs/Greens:** Small, irregular shapes and pieces, distinct green hues ranging from dark to medium green.\n- **Cubed Ingredients:** Appear pale to light yellow-golden, semi-translucent with soft, angular edges.\n- **Bowl:** Uniform dark gray-black on the interior and rim, with some specular highlights reflecting light.\n- **Table:** Visible wood grain and light (mid-brown) coloring, mostly on the right edge of the image.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- **Bowl Position:** The bowl dominates the left and central portions of the image, stretching just past the image center to the right edge, leaving a narrow, curved segment of the table exposed on the right and top.\n- **Soup Fill:** The soup fills most of the bowl, coming nearly to the rim but not overflowing. The liquid surface runs parallel to the visible rim curve, following the bowl's contour.\n- **Ingredient Placement:** Mushroom slices (about 8-10 visible pieces), have organic, flattened oval or kidney shapes, arrayed semi-randomly in the foreground/midground of the soup. Cubes are interspersed among them.\n- **Herbs/Greens:** Scattered throughout the soup as small flecks or sprigs, often clustered around larger ingredients.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- **Photorealistic:** No line art, stylization, or abstraction—realistic forms, lighting, and textures.\n- **Lighting:** Single light source from upper left/top, creating soft shadows and gentle highlights, especially on ingredient surfaces and bowl rim.\n- **Details:** Clear distinction between broth and solid ingredients, visible texture in the soup, gloss on some mushroom slices, and subtle reflections on the bowl.\n- **No Added Decoration:** The focus is entirely on the food; there are no patterns, logos, or extra garnishes.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- **Text/Symbols:** None visible anywhere in the image.\n- **Bowl Rim:** The rim is slightly glossy, with a continuous, smooth edge.\n- **Soup Flecks:** Tiny dark spots distributed across the soup's surface, likely representing herbs or pepper.\n- **Table Surface:** Simple, displaying faint wood grain but otherwise unadorned.\n\n---\n\n**Geometry, Proportions & Layout:**\n- **Bowl Shape:** Roughly a circular arc visible in the frame, with about 65-70% of the bowl's opening shown.\n- **Bowl Outline:** Thick rim (about 1/15th the visible bowl radius), with a high-contrast difference between interior (dark) and soup (light tan).\n- **Proportions:** The soup's surface (visible area) is about 3:2 in aspect ratio in the visible part of the bowl due to viewing angle.\n- **Ingredients Sizes:**\n    - Mushroom slices: Irregular ovals, average length 1/7 to 1/5 the bowl's diameter.\n    - Cubes: Squared, each about 1/15 to 1/10 of bowl diameter.\n    - Herb bits: Tiny specks or leaves, irregular, seldom exceeding 1/30 of bowl diameter.\n\n---\n\n**In summary (for SVG purposes):**\n- Main circular bowl, rim: dark charcoal/black, thick edge, fills ~2/3 of image, mostly left and center.\n- Soup base: smooth but with tiny dark flecks, overall light tan/brown.\n- Mushroom slices: organic, rounded rectangles/ovals, clustered in lower left-to-center.\n- Cubes: semi-transparent, light yellow, nestled between mushrooms.\n- Herb/greens: small, dark-medium green irregular polygons, distributed throughout.\n- Background right/top: wood grain stripe, mid-brown, no texture detail needed beyond subtle grain lines.\n- No text, symbols, or outside elements.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need a visual diagram layout or specific dimensions!",

  "v1_161": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive and precise textual description of the image for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main objects, shapes, and elements:**\n- The central and only object is a round baked pie, viewed from directly above (top-down perspective). \n- The pie is covered with a classic lattice crust made of crisscrossed dough strips.\n- The lattice is formed by approximately 5 vertical and 5 horizontal strips, alternating over and under each other.\n- The edge of the pie crust is crimped with a fluted pattern, giving a wavy/undulating outer border.\n- Inside the lattice, the filling is visible in irregular patches—appears to be red, suggesting a berry (likely strawberry or cherry) filling.\n- The pie is sitting on a wooden slatted trivet with four visible straight slats running horizontally beneath the pie. The trivet is square.\n\n**2. Colors, textures, and visual properties:**\n- The pie crust is golden brown, with a slightly darker toasted surface on the top edges and lighter towards the thicker strips.\n- The strips have a visibly rough, granulated texture, suggesting a sugar-sprinkled finish.\n- The crust edges are a deeper brown and are uneven, accentuating a handmade look.\n- The filling visible through the lattice is glossy, juicy red interspersed with visible fruit pieces.\n- Trivet is light tan or golden wood, smooth and matte.\n- The background is neutral, soft brown/gray, and out of focus, offering contrast.\n- The whole pie exhibits a slightly domed profile (from above, it appears evenly circular).\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning:**\n- The pie takes up almost the entire frame, centered with even space on all sides.\n- The lattice crust is distributed evenly, strips are nearly parallel/perpendicular (forming a grid of squares and rectangles).\n- Each crust strip is approximately 1/8 the diameter of the pie in width (relative proportion).\n- The crimped/fluted edge of the crust is symmetric, but slightly irregular as is typical in handmade baked goods.\n- The trivet sits underneath, with its wooden slats visible at the bottom, extending a bit wider than the pie on the left and right.\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics:**\n- Realistic, photographic style—no abstraction; precise visual detail is present, though the SVG recreation would simplify to clean shapes and fills.\n- The lattice strips often have a zigzag or crimped edge, likely from an edged pastry cutter.\n- No stylization—render as a naturalistic round pie, grid-like lattice, and gently undulating edge.\n- Light comes from upper-left, giving soft shadows to the lower-right (SVG can suggest this with slight gradient or shadow).\n\n**5. Text, symbols, or specific details:**\n- No visible text or symbols.\n- Clear depiction of fruit pieces in the filling under the lattice.\n- Lattice strips layer over and under consistently; e.g., every other column alternating \"over\" and \"under.\"\n- The pie edge's fluting is done with finger pinching or a utensil, forming alternating convex and concave curves (~20-24 total along the full circumference).\n- The trivet runs horizontally, four parallel bars, each about 1/8 pie diameter in thickness, evenly spaced.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric details and proportions:**\n\n- **Pie diameter:** Circle; dominant, nearly touching frame edges. Centered.\n- **Lattice strips:** Vertical and horizontal strips (5 each), width ≈ 1/8 of pie diameter, even spacing. Zigzag edge detail along each long side of strip.\n- **Lattice grid:** Alternating over-under pattern, forming about 16 open square/rectangular gaps, size varies where crust overlaps and filling is exposed.\n- **Pie crust edge:** Concentric to pie, with fluted pattern; each wave is ≈ 1/16 of circumference.\n- **Trivet:** Square underlay, with 4 horizontal bars (thick lines), spaced evenly. Width extends just beyond pie edge left/right.\n\n---\n\n**SVG Construction Notes:**\n- Base: Large circle for main pie.\n- Crust edge: Concentric, wavy/fluted path overlay.\n- Lattice: 10 strips (rectangles or paths), 5 vertical, 5 horizontal, all with zigzag or wavy-edged sides; employ clipping and layering for over-under effect.\n- Filling: Red, radial gradient or patchy areas inside open lattice gaps, with basic ellipses for fruit pieces.\n- Trivet: Four thick horizontal rectangles underneath pie, about 75-80% of pie diameter in length, evenly spaced.\n- Color palette: Golden brown (crust), deeper brown (edges), sugar-crystal highlights (small speckles), vivid red (filling), tan (trivet), neutral gray (background).\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a thorough breakdown for precise SVG recreation.

Colors, textures, and visual properties:**\n\n- **Broccoli:** Main color is a vibrant, medium to dark green (#36802D, #9FCC3B, #1F4E1E), with lighter stems and more saturated, darker green tops. The surface is stippled, bumpy, and natural—more dense and bushy at the tops, smoother and paler at the stems.\n- **Carrots:** Bright orange (#E6761B, #FC7421), with a glossy sheen from the sauce. The carrots are smooth and plump, occasionally showing faint ridges.\n- **Sauce/Glaze:** The vegetables appear shiny and slightly wet, with hints of pale yellow-green highlights; tiny green flecks (possibly herbs or parsley) dotted throughout.\n- **Plate:** Pure white (#FFFFFF), with glossy, reflective highlights. Clean, minimal, rectangular with smoothly rounded edges. Plate is placed at a diagonal angle—bottom left corner closest to the viewer.\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning:**\n\n- **Plate orientation:** Rectangular plate, angled from bottom left to upper right, occupying nearly the full frame.\n  - Plate takes up ~80% of the width and runs diagonally.\n- **Vegetables:** Placed as a central mound, running along the plate’s long axis. Mound tapers toward the far (upper right) edge and broadens near the lower left.\n  - Broccoli and carrots are evenly mixed, with carrots mostly toward the top and middle, broccoli flanking the sides and underneath.\n  - Some carrot pieces overlap or are partially embedded within broccoli clusters.\n  - No single carrot or floret dominates; the distribution is naturalistic and clustered.\n- **Negative space:** Narrow white border of plate visible on all sides, more prominently on the near (front) and far (back) edges.\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic**—the texture and lighting are true to life, without stylization or abstraction.\n- **Lighting:** Bright, diffuse, coming from upper left, creating soft highlights and natural shadows under the vegetables, especially at the edges of the mound.\n- **No borders or outlines**—natural color transitions.\n\n**5. Any text, symbols, or specific details:**\n\n- **No text or symbols** visible anywhere in the image.\n- **Details:** There may be a few tiny bubbles or droplets in the glaze, and the herb flecks are irregular and sparse.\n- The cut ends of the broccoli and some sliced carrot edges are visible, showing pale interiors.\n- Plate is perfectly clean aside from the vegetables; no garnish or additional elements.\n\n---\n\n**SVG-Specific Geometric & Proportional Notes:**\n\n- **Plate:** Rectangle, roughly 8:3 aspect ratio, with a slight perspective angle (not a perfect rectangle from above).\n- **Vegetable mound:** Irregular, roughly oval/elongated blob centered on the plate’s long axis.\n- **Broccoli florets:** Draw as overlapping bushy cloud shapes, 1–2 times the size of the carrot shapes, clustered naturally, with branching stems.\n- **Carrots:** Rounded rectangles with mild taper. Position randomly but interleave with broccoli.\n- **Herb flecks:** Scatter tiny green dots/irregular shapes, ~10–20 per 100 cm².\n- **Highlights:** Add a few soft transparent white highlights on veggies for gloss.\n\nThis should provide all necessary information for an accurate SVG recreation.",

The bowl is nearly circular (ellipse in perspective) and contains a chunky curry.\n- **Curry Contents:**  \n  The curry consists of visible, roughly cuboid pieces and round or oval objects. Identifiable items include:\n  - Cubes/chunks (approx 1-2 cm size) representing sweet potato (orange) and some tomato (red).\n  - Numerous round-ish chickpeas (beige/golden), about 1-1.5 cm diameter.\n  - Smaller green, irregular leafy pieces resembling spinach or similar greens.\n  - The curry liquid is thick and moderately opaque, visibly pooling, golden-yellow in color.\n- **Spoon:**  \n  A metal spoon with a wooden handle is partially submerged on the left side, its handle emerging from the lower left edge of the bowl, curving rightward across the curry surface.\n- **Side Element:**  \n  In the upper-right quadrant, a brown-rimmed, white interior bowl filled with plain white rice is partly visible. Only about the lower one-third of this bowl is shown, cropped by the image frame.\n- **Cloth:**  \n  A white, crumpled napkin is positioned on the bottom right margin, mostly out of focus and overlapping the lower right corner of the rice bowl.\n- **Surface:**  \n  The background is a neutral, light beige stone or marble surface with soft speckling.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Curry:**  \n  - Liquid: Warm yellow-golden (~#E2B95C), creamy texture, visually thick.\n  - Sweet Potato: Muted orange (~#E97B38), matte, soft look, edges rounded.\n  - Chickpeas: Warm tan/light brown (~#D4B883), smooth, slightly glossy, spherical/oval.\n  - Tomato: Muted red (~#C95137), less frequent, some blending with curry.\n  - Spinach: Deep green (~#295221), irregular, leafy, thin, not glossed.\n- **Main Bowl:**  \n  Pure white ceramic (~#FFFFFF), shiny and smooth, thickened rim.\n- **Rice:**  \n  Bright white (~#F9F7F5), individual grains visible, fluffy, slight shadow at edges.\n- **Spoon:**  \n  Handle (left): Dark brown wood (~#593C26), smooth, slightly angled; bowl (right): metallic gray (~#BBAFA4), reflective, with some yellowish reflection from curry.\n- **Napkin:**  \n  Bright white, soft folds, subtle shadowing.\n- **Surface:**  \n  Light beige marble (~#D8CABA), soft speckles, gentle shading/no high contrast.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Bowl of Curry (Main):**  \n  Centered, occupying roughly 70% of the image width, with its rim almost tangent to left, bottom, and right borders, leaving a little space.\n- **Curry Fill:**  \n  Curry level comes close but not fully to the rim, leaving a thin white band (bowl edge) visible all around.\n  - **Spoon:**  \n    From the bottom left, the spoon emerges diagonally, with its bowl immersed at about 20% from the left edge, angled to the right, handle extending out.\n- **Rice Bowl:**  \n  Placed behind and to the right of the curry bowl. Only the bottom third is visible, with the rice heaped above the rim in a mound.\n- **Napkin:**  \n  Lower right, mostly outside the main field, with soft, irregular edges, lightly folded.\n- **Tabletop:**  \n  Background fills the negative space around the bowls, evenly lit.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealism:**  \n  The image is photographic in style—sharp focus on the curry (especially foreground), mild background blur, accurate color and light representation.\n- **Lighting:**  \n  Soft, diffuse, natural lighting from top left; subtle shadow cast on the right edges of objects.\n- **No outlining:**  \n  No high-contrast outlines; separation of elements is via color, shading, and contour.\n- **Perspective:**  \n  Slight overhead (about 30° from horizontal); bowls present as ellipses, not true circles.\n- **Texture:**  \n  Creamy and chunky food texture is emphasized; surfaces glisten slightly, showing saucy moisture.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

  "v1_167": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description of the image, with attention to the elements necessary for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n\n- The central object is a round plate with a decorative border, seen from a top-down perspective.\n- On the plate are:\n  - Two soft tacos, placed in the upper left and upper right quadrants. Each taco is semi-circular, folded around a visible filling.\n  - A pile of shredded cabbage salad (coleslaw) in the lower right quadrant of the plate.\n  - Shredded cheese (yellow and white) sprinkled mainly over the right taco and the area between the tacos.\n  - A small slice of lime, cut in half, placed near the bottom right of the plate.\n  - A metal spoon, with only its bowl visible at the bottom left edge of the plate.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n\n- **Plate:** Creamy white base with a decorative floral pattern. The border features stylized red/pink fruit shapes (like apples or cherries) alternating with green elliptical leaves, all linked by a dark green curving vine.\n- **Tortillas (Tacos):** Pale tan with slight brown searing marks; soft texture; folded but not sealed, displaying fillings.\n- **Taco Filling:** Mixture of chopped grilled meat (light brown and beige with some green seasoning or herbs), topped with a tangle of shredded cheese (white and yellow/orange), with a few visible strips of green (peppers or herbs).\n- **Coleslaw:** Shredded cabbage (white and pale green), with visible strips of carrot (orange) and purple cabbage, plus a creamy dressing giving it a slightly glossy appearance.\n- **Lime:** Bright light green skin with a lighter, almost white core; cross-sectioned to reveal segments.\n- **Spoon:** Metallic, rendered in grayscale/silver, with visible reflection/highlight.\n- **Plate Surface:** Glossy/ceramic.\n- **Background Table:** Wood grain in light brown/golden hue.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- **Plate:** Nearly fills the image, circular, centered, slightly cropped at top and bottom edges.\n- **Taco 1 (Left):** Placed on left side of plate, open side to right, tortilla arc mostly visible, partially overlapping taco filling and salad.\n- **Taco 2 (Right):** Placed on upper right of plate, open side to left, slightly overlapping with taco 1 at center top.\n- **Coleslaw:** Bottom right quadrant, forming a loose mound; overlaps slightly with the bottom edge of the right taco and sits just above the plate border.\n- **Spoon:** The bowl is visible from the left edge, just into the salad and touching the taco filling. The handle is not visible (off frame).\n- **Lime slices:** Two halves, placed immediately below the center and right taco, nestled at the transition between taco filling and salad.\n- **Taco Filling and Cheese:** Filling is subdivided between the two tacos, with a visible central mound of both meat and shredded cheese exposed between the tortilla folds.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic (in original):** For SVG, recreate with flat colors, away from photorealism.\n- **Plate Border Design:** Stylized, decorative, repeating floral pattern—about ten leaf-fruit pairs spaced evenly around the rim.\n- **Food:** Rendered with simplified shapes—taco fillings as irregular ovals/patches, cheese as thin overlapping lines, salad as mixed short curved strips/lines of different colors, lime a pair of concentric circles segmented internally.\n- **Highlights/Texture:** Minimal use of gradients, relying on solid fills and layered paths; gentle use of layering for taco overlap, cheese, and salad.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n\n- **No text** is present on the plate or food.\n- **Symbols:** Only the fruit and vine motifs on the plate rim. Each motif is a rounded red/pink circle (the “fruit”) connected to one or two pointed ovals (the “leaves”), repeating with mild rotation to fit the circular border.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric and Proportional Details for SVG:**\n\n- **Plate:** Central circle, occupying ~95% of SVG canvas width.\n- **Border:** Rim band about 1/12 the width of the plate, decorated.\n- **Tacos:** Each taco is a folded semi-ellipse (about 2/5 the plate diameter long by 1/5 wide). Placed symmetrically but overlapped, with open sides meeting near the top center, roughly 1/5 plate diameter apart.\n- **Coleslaw:** Irregular oval (horizontal), ~1/4 plate diameter, lower right quadrant.\n- **Spoon:** Elliptical bowl, ~1/6 plate diameter, lower left, tangent to rim.\n- **Lime slices:** Two small circles/semicircles, ~1/12 plate diameter each, tightly grouped bottom center-right.\n- **Cheese:** Clustered wavy/yellow-white narrow lines over taco filling.\n- **Salad:** Multi-colored, overlapping short curved lines inside oval.\n\n**Decorative Pattern on Border:**\n- **Ten** clusters (fruit with two leaves) spaced evenly around edge.\n- Each cluster is a ~1/20 diameter red/pink circle, with two ~1/25 by ~1/12 plate diameter green ovals (leaves) forming an angle of ~30 degrees, all touching the rim.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe image depicts a decorated round plate (light background, floral border) carrying two soft folded tacos (upper half, left and right, overlapping slightly), a mound of colorful coleslaw (bottom right), a pile of shredded cheese over taco fillings in the center, two lime slices near the coleslaw, and the bowl of a metal spoon intruding from the lower left. The main food elements overlap and sit atop the plate, which features a repeating border of small fruit and leaves. All colors are bold but not textured. The visual arrangement is balanced, with the main focus drawn to the upper and central features (tacos and cheese), and the coleslaw and other elements supporting the composition at the plate’s lower right.\n\nIf you need further geometric specifics or wish the elements described as specific SVG shapes/paths, let me know!",

Likely \"JURY ROOM\".\n- **Lapel and Seams**: The suit features distinct, symmetrical lapels, seams running from shoulder to underarm, and a button just visible at the base of the jacket.\n- **Hands**: The hands are large and weathered, with pronounced knuckles, visible veins, and clear finger segmentation showing realism.\n- **Proportions**:\n    - **Arms**: Elbow-to-wrist about 1.5x the width of the face (face NOT to be depicted).\n    - **Jacket Lapels**: Each lapel forms a triangle 1/5 the width of the torso.\n    - **Tie**: Width at knot approximately 1/8 torso width, widening to 1/6 lower down.\n    - **Table**: Rises to about 1/6 of the frame height from the bottom.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Layout for SVG:**\n\n- Central figure, arms/forearms resting on a horizontal plane, jacket with broad lapels, visible shirt and tie, detailed clasped hands at lower center.\n- Background left: vertical rectangle for frosted glass door; with centered, slightly blurred “JURY ROOM” text.\n- Background right: wall with horizontal molding, and wooden chair with slats.\n- Monochrome, high-contrast, naturalistic shapes, realistic shading.\n\nLet me know if you need more measurements or geometric breakdowns!",
  "v1_172": "Certainly. Here is a detailed description of the image, crafted for SVG recreation.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n**Foreground:**\n- Dominating the left-center is a man in a classic double-breasted suit. His body is turned slightly left, shoulders at a three-quarter angle. He is clutching a small, ambiguous object in both hands at chest level. A rectangular paper or handkerchief protrudes from the outside breast pocket of his jacket. His tie is visible between the lapels.\n- To the immediate right (viewer’s right) is another man, seen from the waist up, in a darker single-breasted suit and shirt. He faces forward and stands erect, hands by his sides.\n- Behind the central man, slightly right and farther back, stands a woman. She wears a patterned overcoat, characterized by checks/plaid, and has both arms in front as if holding something.\n- Scattered along the far left side and background are five additional human figures, partially obscured and seen only from the shoulders up.\n\n**Background Environment:**\n- The setting is outdoors, presumably at night.\n- Prominent behind the figures is an industrial building or warehouse with visible horizontal siding, a slanted roof, and an upper panel of evenly spaced, illuminated windows.\n- Metal stairs and railings can be seen rising diagonally at the far right behind the figures.\n- Lighting highlights the left side of the image, creating strong contrasting shadows.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Color:** The image is in grayscale (black-and-white). \n- **Textures:**\n    - The foreground suit displays a soft, woolen texture, its lapels and seams clearly defined by highlights and shadowing.\n    - The second man’s suit appears less textured, smoother, and slightly darker in tone.\n    - The background coat is heavily patterned (checkered or plaid), with contrast between light and dark stripes.\n    - The industrial building features horizontal lines and rigid, metallic textural qualities, especially in the upper windowed section.\n    - Light is high-contrast, casting deep black shadows and bright highlights—hallmarks of dramatic 1940s-1960s photography.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Composition:** The main suited man occupies the left third of the image, occupying the vertical center. His hands are central, and his body fills roughly half the image height. The next prominent man stands the right third of the frame, aligned horizontally but slightly behind.\n- **Depth:** The central man is most forward, with other figures (especially the woman with the checked coat) behind and to the right, creating layered depth.\n- **Background:** The warehouse/building starts approximately mid-image and extends up, forming a diagonal backdrop. Stairs and railings cross the top right quadrant diagonally.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photographic Style:** Classic black-and-white realism, with careful attention to contrast and form, reminiscent of postwar documentary or neo-noir cinema.\n- **Framing:** The figures are arranged in a naturalistic, documentary fashion, not formally posed, implying candidness or emotional intensity.\n- **Lighting:** Chiaroscuro effect with strong overhead/artificial light illuminating the central figure while casting deep shadows elsewhere, adding dramatic tension.\n- **Proportions:** The main man’s height dominates roughly 2/3 of the image’s vertical space. Figures are drawn proportionally, without caricature or exaggeration.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **No visible text or symbols** on signage in this crop.\n- **Details:**\n    - Pocket handkerchief or document visible in jacket pocket (left lower lapel).\n    - Buttons are visibly detailed on both men's jackets.\n    - The woman’s coat is distinctly patterned, with broad, light, and dark checker blocks. She appears to clutch/wrap her arms together or hold a bundle.\n    - The industrial building has a repetitive rectangular window pattern along the upper third, each window forming a rectangle, creating a geometric rhythm across the upper background.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** The image centers on two men in suits (one prominent, one to the right), with a woman and a few background figures providing depth. The scene is set at night or dusk, in front of a diagonally receding industrial building with a luminous, repetitive window structure. Overall, this is a highly contrasted, naturalistic black-and-white photograph with a strong sense of layering and drama, ideal for precise SVG recreation using rectangles, polygons, layered gradients, and patterns for clothing texture and background architecture.",

Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout\n\n- **Main Figures**: Each occupies about 1/3 of the image width, headpieces extending vertically into the top 1/5 of the image.\n- **Shoulder Width**: Right figure has visibly broader “shouldered” silhouette due to armor, almost rectangular, filling the central right quadrant.\n- **Headdress Height**: Both headpieces are tall, about 1/3 the height of the full figure; right figure’s is especially tall, with vertical branches and spheres.\n- **Backdrop Patterns**: Arranged in horizontal bands, with a central rectangular block near the top containing denser detail (likely stylized text or key symbol).\n\n---\n\nThis description should enable accurate SVG recreation, with attention to costume geometry, layering, decorative symmetry, and layout.",
  "v1_178": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description of the image, excluding the blurred face:\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- Central subject is a half-length portrait of a seated woman.\n- She is portrayed from the waist up, shown in three-quarters view, with her torso facing slightly to her right and her right arm and left hand in the foreground.\n- Both hands are visible in the lower central part—the right hand is draped over the left wrist, which rests atop the arm of a chair or a parapet.\n- Background features winding rivers, rugged mountains, and winding paths or roads, set in a misty, dreamlike landscape.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- Dominant colors include muted earth tones: dark chocolate brown, olive green, muted ochre, and dusky blues.\n- The subject’s attire is a dark, almost black, robe with golden-brown undertones; the fabric is rendered with soft, subtle brushwork, implying rich textures like silk or velvet.\n- Sleeves below the elbow are a lighter golden-beige, softly gathered and delicately painted to suggest fine, lightweight cloth.\n- The background landscape has a bluish haze, with distant features rendered in softer edges and less distinct tones (atmospheric perspective).\n- The transition between skin, clothing, and background is rendered in soft gradients; shadow and light blend smoothly with little sign of hard lines.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- The subject fills most of the vertical space, centered horizontally.\n- The lower edge of the image is at approximately hip level; the head and shoulders occupy the upper central portion.\n- The right elbow (on viewer’s left) rests on a subtly painted ledge that appears at the bottom edge.\n- The hands are positioned just below the geometric center of the canvas. The right hand (on the left edge) crosses gently over the left wrist and forearm.\n- The background horizon line is slightly above the subject’s shoulders and slopes gently upward from left to right.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The style is classical Renaissance, with a focus on realism, delicate sfumato (soft transitions between colors and tones), and detailed anatomical rendering.\n- The edges are very soft—there are no harsh outlines; forms emerge through transitions of color and tone.\n- The seated posture, clothing details, and enigmatic background are trademarks of iconic portraiture.\n- Light source is gentle, from the upper left, casting soft shadows and highlights particularly on the subject's chest, neck, and folded hands.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- There is no visible text, signature, or symbolic object within the painting beyond the subject, her attire, and the landscape.\n- The armrest or parapet in the foreground is subtly indicated, with a horizontal band and a hint of carved edge.\n- The folds in the drapery on the forearms are intricately detailed and catch the light, showing pale ochre highlights.\n- The background includes a winding river or road which originates near the left side and traverses into distant, misty mountains, reinforcing a sense of depth.\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout (for SVG recreation)**\n- The overall image is a vertical rectangle, traditional portrait orientation (height:width ratio approximately 4:3).\n- Subject’s head and shoulders occupy the upper third, torso and hands the central third, remaining space for lap and ledge at the bottom.\n- The right hand, crossing the left wrist, is at ~1/3 from the bottom and slightly to the left of vertical center.\n- Left arm (on right to viewer) curves from the edge inward, forearm foreshortened, partly parallel to the bottom frame.\n- The visible armrest or parapet runs horizontally along the bottom, spanning just over half the canvas width and forming a stable base.\n- The background horizon curves from ~1/4 of the way down from the top at the left edge to ~1/3 of the way down at the right edge.\n- Mountains, river, and path arcs follow subtle, organic curves and fade into atmospheric haze.\n\nThis should allow an SVG artist to accurately reconstruct the composition, pose, attire, hands, and background structure involved in this classic image.",
  "v1_179": "Certainly! Below is a detailed description of the image for accurate SVG recreation, with a focus on geometry, color, positioning, and painterly style:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The central figure is a half-length bust of a person, turned at a three-quarters angle facing left (from the viewer's perspective).\n- The figure is draped in fabric, with a visible shoulder and neck area.\n- On the head, there is a striking headscarf formed by two distinct parts:\n    - A rounded, voluminous blue section covering the crown and top of the head.\n    - A long, yellowish ochre or gold tail-like band extending from the head, draping down the back and over the right shoulder, with loose folds.\n- A white collar lines the neck and upper shoulder, lying atop the brownish garment.\n- A single, large, teardrop-shaped pearl earring dangles below the ear, catching light and creating a strong highlight.\n- The background is uniformly dark, nearly black, with no discernible features or gradient.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- The background is a rich, deep black.\n- The blue headscarf is medium-to-deep blue with subtle texture that implies a fine, soft fabric (silk or cotton). \n- The long, hanging band is golden ochre with ochre-brown stripe-like shadows and a blue-tinted end, rendered with soft, blended brush-strokes to suggest folds and draping.\n- The garment is an earthy yellowish-brown with soft, painterly shadows and highlights. The texture suggests thick, coarse cloth.\n- The white collar provides high contrast to the garment, rendered cleanly with crisp, highlighted edges.\n- The pearl earring is rendered almost photo-realistically, with a white highlight and soft gray shadows, suggesting lustrous, smooth texture.\n- The style features pronounced chiaroscuro: deep shadows with bright highlights, and subtle blending, typical of 17th-century Dutch painting.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The figure is placed slightly to the right of center, with the head angled towards the left edge of the frame.\n- The blue headscarf occupies the upper right quadrant, beginning near the top margin and ending just below the midpoint, above the white collar.\n- The golden draping band starts at the crown of the head, arcs over and behind the ear, and hangs vertically, reaching the lower half of the right side.\n- The white collar cuts diagonally from the nape of the neck down towards the left edge (bottom third).\n- The pearl earring dangles below the ear, horizontally in line with the lower edge of the headscarf.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The composition is vertical (portrait), with the subject filling most of the frame.\n- The painting is executed in a Baroque style with soft, expertly blended transitions and a limited, harmonious palette.\n- Brushwork is refined and mostly invisible, except in folds of the fabric, notably the golden band where the strokes create a sense of depth.\n- The image is highly realistic but avoids photographic precision on the clothing—edges are softened and light wraps naturally.\n- No visible outlines; all transitions are managed through shading and changes in value/color.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- There is no text, inscription, or symbols present.\n- The most visually specific details:\n    - The glimmer on the pearl earring, rendered as a single dot of white with a crescentary shadow.\n    - The transition from the blue headband to the yellow trailing fabric: the latter wraps behind and below the blue section, and is visible due to its shadowed lower edge and illuminated highlight along one fold.\n    - The garment’s shoulder is voluminous, creating a triangle-like silhouette from the bottom right corner diagonally upward and leftward, intersecting with the white collar.\n\n---\n\n**Relative Proportions & Layout (as would be helpful for SVG):**\n- **Canvas Proportion:** Portrait; approximately 5:7 (width:height).\n- **Headscarf:** Blue portion = ellipsoid, approx. 1/3 the width of the canvas, placed at the upper middle.\n- **Yellow band:** Width = ~1/8 canvas width; length from the head to two-thirds of the canvas height.\n- **White collar:** A curved triangle below the head, extending from mid-right edge towards lower-left.\n- **Garment:** Occupies the lower half of the figure, from midline to right edge, characterized by a wedge rising from bottom right to near upper center.\n\n**Color hex approximations:**\n- Background: #191919\n- Blue headscarf: #4A70AD\n- Yellow/gold band: #C9AC60 (with shadows #9C8038, tips have #B0C0C4 blue)\n- Garment: #7A5B38 (deep golden brown)\n- Collar: #F4F4ED\n- Pearl: #E9E9E7, highlight #FFFFFF\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe image is a masterful painterly depiction of a turned figure in historic dress, with strong chiaroscuro, rendered in deep blue, golden ochre, brown, and white against a black background. The fabric’s form, reflective jewelry, and placement create a harmonious and tranquil composition ideal for SVG translation.",

  "v1_182": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive and technical description of the image, with no references to any blurred face:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- **Central Figure:** The central object is a nude female figure (Venus) standing upright on a large scallop shell. Her body forms a gently elongated S-curve—her right arm crosses her torso to cover her chest and her left hand covers her groin, with her left leg crossing gracefully in front. Her long, flowing, golden hair cascades down her back and across her body and shell.\n- **Scallop Shell:** The shell beneath Venus is large and centrally located at the bottom of the image, radiating outward with a fan of about 14-16 ridges. It floats near the water’s surface.\n- **Left Side (Wind Deities):** On the left, a flying duo is depicted. The male figure has wings and wraps his arms around a female companion. Both figures are airborne, with legs outstretched behind, drapery and hair streaming backward.\n    - They are surrounded by small pink flowers, blown rightward by swirling winds.\n- **Right Side (Attendant):** A female figure in a long, flowing white and floral-decorated gown stands on land at the shoreline, extending a red mantle or cloak edged with gold towards the central figure, as if to clothe her. The gown’s fabric is rich with intricate dark blue floral patterns, and the mantle is decorated with flowers.\n- **Background Elements:** The scene is set against a turquoise-blue sea, calm and gently rippled, extending to the horizon. A thin strip of land with dark, bushy trees (possibly orange trees) runs behind the right-hand figure. The sky above is clear, with a smooth gradient from aquamarine near the horizon to deeper blue at the top.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Color Scheme:** The overall palette is pastel and muted, dominated by pale blues (water, sky, central shell), creams and golds (Venus, shell, hair), and deeper rich reds and greens (robe, trees, shadowed water).\n- **Textures:**\n    - **Skin:** Smooth and luminous, with subtle shading and no visible brushstrokes.\n    - **Shell:** Pearlescent, with soft shadowing suggesting concavity and depth.\n    - **Water:** Evenly stippled with small wavelets, giving a light shimmering effect.\n    - **Cloth:** Robe and gown are detailed, with fine folds and patterned designs, capturing the flowing motion.\n    - **Hair:** Venus’s hair is rendered in stylized, S-shaped locks, finely detailed and undulating.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Central Axis:** Venus stands at the image center, positioned slightly forward compared to the other figures.\n- **Left Grouping:** The wind deities (Zephyrus and Aura) are to the viewer’s left, slightly above and to the rear of Venus, with their bodies angled from upper left towards the center. Their billowing garments and wind motif direct movement rightwards.\n- **Right Grouping:** The attendant stands to the far right, on solid ground with her body turned leftward, stepping lightly on toes, holding the cloak towards Venus.\n- **Foreground Elements:** The scallop shell is in the foreground, centered at the bottom.\n- **Background:** Ocean stretches to the horizon with scattered flowers on the surface; trees and land provide a backdrop on the right; sky occupies the upper fifth of the image.\n- **Proportions:** Venus’s figure is about 1/3 the height of the canvas, the shell is roughly 1/5 the canvas width. All figures are elongated, typical of early Renaissance proportions.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Artistic Style:** The image is a prime example of Early Italian Renaissance painting, using tempera on canvas. The style is characterized by:\n    - Linear outlines: Contours are clean and distinct.\n    - Graceful, idealized anatomy: Figures are elongated and pose elegantly.\n    - Decorative detailing: Fabrics and hair have fine, rhythmic patterning.\n    - Use of gold or yellow highlights: Particularly in hair and cloak.\n    - Lack of strong light-shadow contrast (chiaroscuro is minimal).\n\n---\n\n**5. Any Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n\n- **Text:** No visible inscriptions or embedded text.\n- **Flowers:** Pink and white roses are scattered, especially blowing from left to right, some with gold centers.\n- **Patterns:** The gown on the right has consistent blue botanical motifs, while the red mantle features gold brocade-like details.\n- **Wings:** The male wind deity possesses feathered wings, colored in dark blues and greens.\n- **Mantle:** The red mantle has a repeating floral pattern and gold trim, billowing in the wind.\n- **Hair Details:** Venus’s hair forms long, spiraling coils, with strands curling in stylized arcs.\n- **Shoreline Details:** The land on the right is edged with reeds and dense, dark spinach-green leaves, possibly orange trees with small golden dots (fruit).\n- **Motion:** The entire scene conveys a sense of movement from left to right, indicated by the posture of figures, the fluttering drapery, flying flowers, and flowing hair.\n- **Water Surface:** The water’s edge is scalloped with small inlets, and the ocean is dotted with flowers.\n\n---\n\n**Layout for SVG Recreation:**\n- **Canvas Ratio:** Landscape orientation, approximately 2:1 width to height.\n- **Venus Position:** Centered horizontally and vertically, standing on shell base.\n- **Shell:** Centered at base, covering about 30% of the image width.\n- **Left Figures:** Placed from the top-left moving diagonally toward Venus at just above her shoulder height.\n- **Right Figure:** Stands on solid ground near the lower right, slightly above Venus’s feet but with a bend in her posture leaning towards center.\n- **Background:** Horizon line at upper third; sky above, sea below, distant dark land at right.\n- **Main Boundaries:** No hard border except for the ends of the scene, natural fade to corners.\n\nThis should provide all essential visual, positional, and design details for accurate SVG recreation.",
  "v1_183": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description of the image, suitable for recreation as an SVG:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- The composition is horizontally oriented and centers on a seated female figure in profile, facing left.\n- The woman sits in a straight-backed wooden chair, her body—especially her large, dark dress—forming a compact triangular mass from the lower right toward the center.\n- Her hands, resting lightly in her lap and on the chair’s arm, are clasped and covered by lacy white cuffs.\n- A footstool rests beneath her feet. It is a simple rectangular block, slightly shorter than the space between her skimmed dress hem and the floor.\n- A framed picture hangs on the pale gray wall above and to the left of the woman’s head. Its frame is distinct, forming a crisp black rectangle. The artwork within the frame is a simple landscape featuring horizontal bands.\n- To the left of the woman (taking up the left third of the canvas) is a tall curtain, extending from the top edge to nearly the bottom. It bunched near the wall and features floral/patterned motifs.\n- Floorboards and baseboards are visibly delineated below, giving spatial grounding.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- The palette is muted and reserved, primarily grays, blacks, and creams with faint sepia tones.\n- The wall is painted a cool, flat gray. The floor is taupe with visible linear wood grain.\n- The woman’s dress is solid, deep black, absorbing light with smooth, soft texture; subtle folds are suggested by low-contrast highlights.\n- Her lace cuffs and cap are pale white, rendered with feathery, translucent brushwork suggesting intricate fabric.\n- The curtain is a slightly bluish-black, patterned with wavy lines and stippled dabs of pale lemon yellow and white, creating a floral design.\n- The chair is dark brown or black, its geometry mostly obscured by the figure.\n- The footstool is ochre or light brown, with a flattened, blocky shape.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- The figure is placed right of center, occupying the right two-thirds of the image horizontally, with her knees and feet nearly touching the lower edge.\n- The top of the woman’s head sits just below the upper edge; her back is near (but not merging with) the right vertical edge.\n- The chair sits at an angle, perpendicular to the picture plane.\n- The curtain runs vertically from the upper left and hugs the left edge of the composition.\n- The framed picture is horizontally centered above the curtain but offset to balance the composition.\n- The footstool sits directly below the woman’s feet, parallel to the lower edge and close to the left border.\n- There’s a clear, rectilinear, almost architectural arrangement of major horizontal and vertical elements—frame, floor, curtain, baseboard.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The overall style is pared-down realism with an emphasis on harmony of tone and form.\n- Brushwork is restrained and smooth, with little texture except in the rendering of the curtain’s pattern and the lace details on the woman’s clothing.\n- Edges are sharp on geometric elements (frames, footstool) and soft where fabric fades into shadow.\n- The scene is lit from above/left, casting subtle shadows, but is overall very diffuse, flat-lit, and without strong contrasts, enhancing the stillness and solemnity.\n- The model’s form is presented in simple, clear silhouette, making her shape instantly recognizable and iconic.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- The only explicit symbol is the framed picture on the wall, which contains a minimalist landscape with light and dark horizontal bands, implying land, water, and sky.\n- Above the curtain, near the picture frame, is a faint circular stamp or mark, possibly a sigil or monogram; its details are subtle and mostly lost in the curtain’s texture.\n- The curtain design consists of undulating vertical lines and scattered clusters of tiny flowers or dots, adding visual rhythm.\n- The wooden floor has visible linear separations to suggest planks, running horizontally.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric Details and Proportions**\n- The woman’s seated figure occupies roughly the right two-thirds horizontally and the lower three-quarters vertically.\n- The chair back is just inside the rightmost quarter.\n- The footstool is about 1/10th the width of the picture, supporting her parallel feet in thin, black shoes.\n- The framed picture on the wall is a horizontal rectangle, about 1/6th the width and 1/10th the height, placed above the midpoint, close to the woman’s head.\n- The curtain’s edge is a crisp vertical, occupying the leftmost quarter, with pattern density increasing toward the edge.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed and proportionally-aware description should provide all necessary data for accurate SVG recreation.",

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n\n- **Mountains:**  \n  - Dominant large, steep mountain rising sharply from the bottom left-center, occupying the left 1/3 and center of the image.  \n  - The mountain has a rounded, towering form, with deeply incised vertical lines and ridges running from the base upward.  \n  - Smaller hills in the foreground (bottom left), with rounded, domed shapes.\n  - Further behind the main mountain, a wide expanse of midground mountains runs horizontally and creates a layered look. These background mountains have smoother, undulating horizontal contours.\n  - Distant, low, wavy-edged mountain silhouettes in the far background stretch the entire width of the image.\n- **Trees/Forest:**  \n  - Scattered clusters and lines of pine-like trees adorn the mountain slopes and the flatlands to the right of the central mountain.  \n  - Individual trees are depicted as vertical, thin trunks with small, dense, rounded foliage at the tops—appearing mostly as dark dots or tufts.  \n  - Denser clusters of trees occupy the lower-right quadrant (island/riverbank area), with a mixture of upright and slightly tilted trunks.\n- **Water and Land:**  \n  - Flat, open water or river occupies the middle and right sections, providing separation between nearer landmasses and the distant mountains.\n  - Small land masses (\"islands\") with more trees protrude into the water area to the right of the composition.\n- **Small Structures:**  \n  - A tiny pavilion or house is perched atop the tall central mountain, with a faintly triangular roof.  \n  - Another small structure is partially visible amongst the trees, near the base of the main mountain.\n- **Vegetation/Rocks:**  \n  - Bushes and rocky outcrops are scattered on slopes and near the water’s edge, usually angular or roughly oval forms.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n\n- **Color Palette:**  \n  - Monochromatic sepia/brown wash: background is a pale brownish or yellowed parchment tone, ink work is dark gray to black.\n- **Texture:**  \n  - The mountain’s sweeping, exposed rock faces are depicted with broad, dry brushstrokes, creating striated textures.  \n  - Trees and foliage use stippled, dotting, and short brushstrokes for texture contrast.  \n  - Water is rendered as open negative space, possibly with faint horizontal ink wash lines.\n- **Visual Properties:**  \n  - High contrast between solid ink marks (trees, rock shadows) and untouched background (sky, water).\n  - Edges are generally soft (brushwork), with suggested rather than sharply defined details.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- **Foreground:**  \n  - Cropped hills and rocks occupy the entire lower edge.\n- **Central Composition:**  \n  - Main mountain’s base is about 20% from the left and extends up to about 70% of the height of the image, creating the largest vertical element and focal point.\n  - The summit of this mountain is slightly left of center, with tiny structure at the peak.\n  - Forested slope at the mountain’s base leads to more open, flat land—a riverbank or floodplain—extending toward the right.\n- **Midground:**  \n  - A prominent cluster of trees is found to the right of the mountain, surrounded by water, like a wooded island.\n- **Background:**  \n  - Series of layered mountains, gradually receding and lightening towards the top edge and right, reinforcing atmospheric perspective.\n- **Negative Space:**  \n  - Large areas of pale, empty space (water, sky) contrast with the denser ink of landforms and vegetation.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Traditional Chinese Landscape Painting (Shan Shui):**  \n  - Hand scroll format, horizontal layout, panoramic composition.\n  - Ink wash technique with subtle gradation.\n  - Asymmetrical balance; visual weight is concentrated left-of-center.\n  - Emphasis on verticality in the central mountain.\n  - Minimalist: details are suggested with spare, calligraphic brushwork rather than meticulously rendered.\n  - Atmospheric depth—forms fade toward background, showing mastery of spatial illusion.\n  - No human figures visible.\n- **Proportions:**  \n  - Main mountain: height ≈ 60-70% of image height, base width ≈ 30-35% of image width.\n  - Island cluster (right): from 50% to 90% along horizontal axis, takes up lower 40% vertically.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n\n- **No visible text, inscriptions, or seals** are present in the section shown.\n- **Structural detail:**  \n  - Tiny structure atop the central mountain—likely a simple rectangle with a single gable/trapezoidal roof.\n- **Tree depiction:**  \n  - Trees mainly as vertical lines (trunks), topped with dense, short, rounded marks (foliage/pine needles).\n- **Rock and Mountain Texture:**  \n  - Contour lines and angular shadows create steep, enclosed sections and ridges.\n  - Darker areas at shadow sides, lighter on sun-exposed facets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Layout Diagram (ASCII):**\n\n```\n+-------------------------------------------------+\n|                                                 |\n|                   /‾\\   [Back mts]             |\n|       /----\\     /   \\    /--\\       /---\\      |\n|      /      \\   /     \\  /    \\     /     \\     |\n|    /          \\        [Sky and mountain]       |\n|   /   Main Mt  \\                                 |\n|  /              \\           [Distant hills]     |\n| /                \\                              |\n|/------------------\\                           + |\n||       Island/      \\          [Water]        | |\n||       Forest        \\                       /  |\n||        Area          |_______           __/    |\n| \\                     |      | Cluster |        |\n|  \\_                __/       | of trees|        |\n|    \\______________/           \\_______/         |\n|                                                 |\n+-------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n**SVG Recreation Notes:**\n\n- Use **path** and **polygon** shapes for mountains/hills with sweeping curves and angular folded ridges.\n- Use **lines** and **scattered ellipses/dots** for tree trunks and foliage tufts, especially on slopes and islands.\n- Leave water and sky areas mostly blank, with perhaps faint washed lines or very subtle gradients.\n- Place the small pavilion at the mountainous summit with simple geometric shapes.\n- Vary opacity or stroke strength for depth—darker and more defined in foreground, lighter toward the background.\n\nIf you need a specific SVG code template based on this description, let me know!",

  "v1_189": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description suitable for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main objects, shapes, and elements**  \n- The central object is a large green leaf, seen from above.\n- The leaf is broad, roughly oval-triangular with a wavy edge, occupying most of the image. \n- The central stem (midrib) runs vertically from the bottom center upward, with a few lateral veins fanning out right and left.\n- The surface is heavily perforated: there are numerous irregularly shaped holes and missing sections, especially concentrated near the central vein and lower half of the leaf.\n- Additional large green leaves are visible around and behind the central leaf, forming an overlapping background.\n\n**2. Colors, textures, and visual properties**  \n- The main leaf is light to medium green, with some yellow-brown discoloration (particularly around the damaged areas and base).\n- The texture is smooth but slightly wrinkled, with visible vein structure.\n- The holes reveal either brownish leaf skeletonization or the shadowy dark green of the leaves beneath.\n- Surrounding leaves are a solid, fresher green, with smoother, less damaged surfaces.\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning**  \n- The main leaf is oriented with its apex (tip) towards the top right corner and its base near the bottom left.\n- Central vein is diagonal, from lower left to upper right, roughly a 30-degree angle.\n- Damaged areas (holes/patches) are densest in the lower center and around the main vein, with smaller holes radiating outward.\n- Background leaves are less distinct, mainly framing the central leaf on the top and sides.\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics**  \n- The image is photorealistic in terms of style; smooth gradients and shading, not stylized or heavily abstracted.\n- Perforations are random, organically shaped – varying from tiny rounded holes (1-3mm diameter) to larger jagged openings (up to 30mm), with a lacy or netted appearance especially near the leaf base.\n\n**5. Any text, symbols, or specific details**  \n- No text or symbols present.\n- Key details: prominent central vein, minor veins branching out symmetrically, large irregular patches of missing leaf tissue, some brown-yellow discoloration where damage is greatest, leaf edge remains generally intact.\n\n**Geometric details, proportions, and layout specifics for SVG**  \n- **Canvas**: Square, as per the image (1:1 aspect)\n- **Main leaf**: Covers ~70% of canvas; base at bottom left, tip towards top right.\n- **Veins**: Central vein is a ~5% width line starting at 10% from bottom, 20% from left, running to 80% top, 80% right. Lateral veins branch at ~30°-60° angles left and right from midrib.\n- **Perforations**: \n   - Clustered, varying in size; largest clusters in a central band, ~60% of surface area in that region lost.\n   - Individual holes: use ovals/irregular blobs, mostly vertically elongated along vein paths.\n   - Hole sizes: 5-30px-wide random polygons with rounded edges for organic look.\n- **Color**: Base leaf healthy green (#74a54e to #b7dd76). Damaged areas are brownish (#cab879), yellow (#e2e589), or pale tan. Veins are lighter green or pale yellow-green.\n- **Background leaves**: Partial, edge-blurred, no holes, darker green (#49732e).\n\n---\n\nThis description should provide clear guidance for accurately recreating the image as an SVG.

  "v1_190": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description of the image for SVG recreation purposes:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Primary Object:** The main focus is on several elongated, bulbous droplets of tree resin (sap) emerging from the textured surface of a tree bark.\n- **Main Shapes:** \n  - Three prominent resin droplets dominate the scene, curving downward and forward.\n    - The central droplet is the largest and most elongated, shaped like a thick, uneven cylinder with a rounded tip, transitioning to a narrow base at the bark.\n    - To the upper left, a slightly shorter droplet curves outward, also cylindrical but with a rounder bulb at the tip.\n    - The top-right droplet is shorter and tapers more abruptly, ending in a knob-like tip.\n  - At the top left edge, a faint, partially visible fourth droplet appears, but it’s mostly out of focus.\n- **Background Elements/Textures:** \n  - The background consists of rough, craggy tree bark with irregular, jagged, and cracked surfaces.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Resin (Sap) Droplets:**\n  - Colors: Shades of golden yellow, honey amber, and transparent orange.\n  - Texture: Highly glossy and smooth with intricate internal air bubbles, giving a glasslike, semi-transparent appearance. Highlights and reflections create bright white and yellowish sparkles.\n- **Tree Bark:**\n  - Colors: Very dark brown, almost black in some crevices, with touches of gray, green moss, and subtle hints of orange-brown where the sap meets the bark.\n  - Texture: Matte, coarse, and rough with deep fissures and flakes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Resin Droplets:**\n  - Emanate from the center-top of the image and drip downward (gravity direction).\n  - The largest droplet is slightly left of center, tilting downward at about a 45-degree angle.\n  - The second (upper left) droplet branches off to the upper left of the central one.\n  - The third (upper right) droplet branches to the upper right.\n  - All three are spatially clustered, with their bases very close or overlapping.\n- **Background (Bark):**\n  - Occupies the entire background, with sap sitting atop and protruding outward.\n  - Some bark edges and raised knots overlap with the sap at the base.\n  - Most focus and sharpness are in the foreground where the resin is, with the background receding out of focus (shallow depth of field).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealism:** The image is extremely detailed, representing natural light interactions with glossy, translucent surfaces.\n- **Macro Photography:** Close-up, highly magnified perspective emphasizing small details.\n- **Lighting:** High-contrast, with strong highlights on the resin and deeper shadows in bark crevices.\n- **No Stylized Effects:** All textures and forms appear lifelike and unmanaged by artistic abstraction.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Any Text, Symbols, Specific Details\n\n- **No Text or Symbols** are present in the image.\n- **Specific Details:**\n  - Bubbles and streaks are embedded within the resin, visible as lighter lines and tiny spheres.\n  - The contact points between the resin and bark show resin flows conforming closely to the uneven bark surface.\n  - Some fine, thread-like plant fibers or debris are embedded at the bottom right of the resin mass.\n  - The foreground resin displays slight color gradients: deeper amber at the thicker portions, lighter and more transparent toward thin edges.\n\n---\n\n### Geometric & Proportional Details for SVG\n\n#### Proportions & Layout:\n\n- **Image orientation:** Square.\n- **Resin droplets' combined area:** About 40% of the image, positioned from center toward the upper half.\n- **Largest droplet:** \n  - Originates approximately 40% from the left edge, 15% from the top, extends diagonally downward left for about 30% of image height.\n  - Width varies (starts at 7% of image width at base, bulges to 13%, narrows to 9% at tip).\n- **Upper left droplet:** \n  - Originates above and left of the large one, curves down and slightly left, about half as long.\n- **Upper right droplet:** \n  - Starts to the right, shorter, curves slightly outward and down right.\n- **All droplets slightly overlap at bases.**\n- **Bark area:** Irregular contour, comprising the entire background, with deep shadow patterns radiating outward from resin bases.\n\n---\n\n**SVG Construction Recommendations:**\n- Use multiple overlapping translucent amber/gold paths for resin, each with internal gradients and highlights.\n- Employ an irregular multi-shaded path for bark with jagged edges and irregular splotches.\n- Simulate bubbles with small, semi-transparent light circles inside droplets.\n- Add streaks and reflections using low-opacity, fine white lines following droplet contours.\n- Keep details sharp and high-contrast in foreground resin and blur/fade back into darker bark background peripherally.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need an even more technical breakdown or rough path coordinates!",
  "v1_191": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description suitable for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- **Tomato**: The main object is a single, large, developing tomato, held in the foreground by a hand. The tomato is roughly circular to slightly oval in shape and is somewhat squat or flattened on its lower side.\n- **Blossom End Rot**: A prominent, irregularly shaped dark patch (necrotic spot) appears on the bottom (blossom end) of the tomato. This lesion is oval to kidney-shaped with jagged, organic edges.\n- **Hand**: A left human hand (using the thumb, index, and part of the middle finger), gently supports the tomato from underneath, with only the tips and partial segments of the fingers visible.\n- **Leaves and Stem**: In the background and upper left, part of the tomato plant is visible, including a large, textured green leaf with serrated edges and a bit of a hairy, slightly angled stem and a few small, fuzzy flower sepals.\n- **Background**: Out-of-focus green foliage, indicating other tomato plants or greenery.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Tomato Surface**: The tomato is mostly light yellow-green (hex: #e8e782 to #dce175), with some pale green blushes, matte texture, and very faint, subtle veins/striations.\n- **Blossom End Rot Lesion**: The necrotic patch gradates from deep, almost black-brown (#36251e) in the center to lighter brownish-gray/beige (#7c6650 to #cebdb2) at the irregular borders, with a dry, sunken, slightly shriveled texture compared to the rest of the fruit.\n- **Hand**: Pale pink-tan Caucasian skin (#f6ded3 for highlights, #e0bca7 for shadow), smooth with subtle wrinkles and nail beds visible.\n- **Leaf**: Tomato leaf is medium to dark green (#3a7037 to #307031), deeply veined, and has jagged/serrated edges. Slightly matte and rough texture with visible vein patterns.\n- **Stem/Sepals**: Light green and covered with fine, short white hairs (>#bdd487), giving a slightly fuzzy look.\n- **Background**: Soft-focus, various shades of bright grass green, providing high contrast to foreground details.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Tomato**: Centered and dominant, occupying about 55% of image width and height.\n- **Hand**: Enters frame from the lower left. The tip of the thumb is at the tomato’s lower left edge, other fingers are beneath or at the lower border of the tomato, helping cradle it gently but not obscuring much of the fruit's surface.\n- **Tomato Lesion**: Centered on lower third of the tomato, offset slightly to the right. The lesion occupies about 30–35% of the tomato’s visible surface, breaking the otherwise smooth shape.\n- **Leaf/Stem**: Tomato leaf extends from upper left margin towards the tomato, partially overlapping and receding back. The stem branches off the top and bears fuzzy sepals/flower stems pointing upward/right.\n- **Background**: Out of focus; no distinct geometry, just color gradients and blurred plant shapes.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Photorealistic, natural style:** Image is clear and crisp in foreground, with a shallow depth of field blurring the background.\n- **Natural light:** Lighting is diffuse and soft, with gentle shading accentuating three-dimensional forms (tomato’s roundness, lesion’s depth, hand’s contour).\n- **No outlines:** Color-edge contrast defines shapes, not drawn lines.\n- **Visual emphasis:** The lesion on the tomato is the focal point due to its strong value and color contrast.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, Specific Details**\n- **No text or synthetically drawn symbols.**\n- **Notable detail:** Tomato lesion is irregular and not perfectly centered; it visibly indents the fruit, with blended boundary/edge coloration and a wrinkled, sunken appearance.\n- **Subtle highlight**: A soft, white highlight is visible on the tomato’s upper left, indicating light direction.\n- **Leaf veins:** Leaf veins are prominent, resembling a feathered or palmate pattern, with veins radiating from the central stem.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric and Proportional Details for SVG:**\n- **Canvas suggestion:** Square, e.g. 600×600 units.\n- **Tomato outline:** Ellipse, center at (300, 320), radii approx. 180×170 units.\n- **Lesion shape:** Freeform path; centroid at (360, 420), approx. 90×75 units, with undulating/organic edges.\n- **Hand:** Three visible finger tips (centered at ~[180, 490], [230, 540], [280, 560]), each as an overlapping ellipse, skintone fills, subtle shadow gradients.\n- **Leaf:** Complex, jagged path starting at upper left (~[100, 120]), extending to tomato top left, approx. 220×160 units in area, detailed veins by thinner paths.\n- **Stem:** Slight curve from top, width ~15 units, covered in many tiny lines to represent hairs.\n- **Background:** Large rectangle, radial or linear green gradient; blurred ellipses to imitate foliage.\n- **Shadows:** Soft shadow under tomato and where fingers tuck under/behind the fruit, blended for natural look.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis image features a single pale green/yellow tomato with an irregular, dark, sunken rot patch near its bottom, held gently by a left hand, with part of a serrated tomato leaf and fuzzy stem visible in the upper left. The composition is naturalistic, slightly off-center. Colors are cool and earthy, and all foreground shapes are formed by color/gradient transitions rather than hard outlines, with photorealistic textures and visual interest focused on damage to the fruit.

  "v1_192": "Here is a detailed and precise description of the image, organized as requested for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Central Object:** The main object is a single, shriveled, decaying fruit (likely an apple or plum) hanging from the end of a thin, short twig attached to a broader tree branch.\n- **Branches:** Several bare tree branches occupy the foreground, criss-crossing the composition. The main branch, thicker and roughly horizontal, cuts across the lower part of the image, with smaller offshoots and a node (bump) visible.\n- **Background:** The background is blurred, smooth, and empty, emphasizing the foreground detail. There’s a subtle suggestion of sky and distant out-of-focus objects or horizon.\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Fruit:**\n  - **Color:** Deep reddish-brown, maroon, and brown shades. The decayed areas are darker and mottled. There are pale, beige, or light tan specks and crusty mold-grown patches on its surface.\n  - **Texture:** Highly irregular, rough, and cracked. The surface displays rot, wrinkles, bumps, and fuzzy mold growth.\n- **Branches:**\n  - **Color:** Ashy grayish-tan with hints of olive-green and patches of yellowish lichen.\n  - **Texture:** Branches are mostly smooth but have small bumps (nodes) and rougher areas where lichen or moss grow.\n- **Background:**\n  - **Color:** Gradient of pale blue at top left (sky) to very light pinkish-white (clouds or horizon), fading into grayish-blur near the lower/middle area.\n  - **Texture:** Very blurry, with no detail; acts as negative space.\n  \n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Fruit**\n  - Roughly spherical but not perfectly round (oval, slightly flattened). \n  - Hangs down from the end of a thin twig; about one-fifth the width of the main branch.\n  - Located slightly left of the image center, mostly below the diagonal formed by the main branch.\n- **Branches**\n  - The main branch runs diagonally from lower left to upper right, thick and foregrounded.\n  - A thinner branch intersects at a ~30-degree angle upward to the left, from which the fruit dangles.\n  - Other small twigs or buds protrude from the main branch but do not carry leaves.\n- **Background**\n  - Out-of-focus, gradient from blue (top left) to off-white/gray (around fruit and lower).\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealistic** representation; natural proportions and organic randomness.\n- **Depth of field:** Shallow; only the fruit and the immediate branch are sharply focused.\n- **Lighting:** Soft and diffused, likely natural daylight. No harsh shadows; lighting comes from the left, highlighting textures.\n- **Color Palette:** Natural, muted earth tones. The vibrancy is low, consistent with late autumn or winter.\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, Specific Details\n\n- **No text, numbers, or overt symbols** anywhere in the image.\n- **Details for SVG:**\n  - **Fruit shape:** Draw as an irregular sphere, about one-fourth to one-fifth the image height/width, with uneven surface detail.\n  - **Surface pattern:** Overlay patches of lighter beige/tan (for mold) over the main maroon/brown base; indicate deep creases and patches of shriveled, sunken areas.\n  - **Twig:** Thin, extending diagonally, attached perpendicularly to the thicker branch.\n  - **Main branch:** Thick, nearly fills the lower quarter of image, with several nodes or stubs, and visible yellow circles/blotches (lichen).\n  - **Background:** Large smooth gradient with *no* hard edges or shapes; colors shift from blue (top left) to off-white/gray (center and lower right).\n\n---\n\n**Proportions for SVG layout:**\n- Fruit: Centered at about 40% from left, 50% from top.  \n- Main branch: 1/6 of image height thick; runs approximately 30° from lower left to upper right.\n- Twig: ~1/10 branch thickness, emerges at about 150° (measured CCW from right) from branch, with fruit at near its tip.\n- Fruit diameter: ~1/3 to 1/4 of branch diameter.\n\n**Summary:**  \nA single brown, decayed, and moldy fruit with irregular tan-and-maroon textures hangs off a short twig, which diverges from a thick, smooth, gray-brown tree branch speckled with yellow lichen. The background is a softly blurred blue-and-white gradient, suggesting sky and distance. No text or artificial elements are present. The composition is photorealistic and naturally lit with sharp focus only on the foreground subjects.",
  "v1_193": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and accurate description of the image above, focusing on the elements necessary to recreate the image as an SVG:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- The main object is a single cabbage plant seen from above and slightly obliquely, prominent in the foreground/center of the image.\n- The cabbage consists of multiple overlapping, undulating leaves radiating outward from a central, compact core or head.\n- The leaves are broad, wavy, with visible curvilinear veins, and have irregular, somewhat serrated edges.\n- Surrounding the central cabbage are portions of other cabbage plants, some only partially visible.\n- The ground, made up of exposed soil, is visible around the outer edges of the plant and in spaces between leaves.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- The dominant color is green, but the greens range from pale, slightly bluish-green (outer leaves) to bright, vivid, fresh green (inner, newer leaves).\n- Some outer leaves have tinges of yellow, brown, or even light purple at the tips or in spots, indicating older or decaying foliage.\n- Leaf veins are a lighter green-white, often thick and richly branched, especially in the central and midrib portions.\n- The soil is a dull earth brown.\n- Texture of leaves is crinkled and waxy, with subtle gloss reflecting natural light. Old leaves appear drier and less glossy, while new leaves look smoother and more hydrated.\n- Some leaves display small holes or tears.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- The main cabbage plant is located centrally, taking up roughly 2/3 of the width and over half the height of the image canvas.\n- Leaves radiate in concentric, roughly circular layers from the compact center.\n- Outer leaves are flattened on the soil; inner leaves are more vertical and curled, forming a cup-like core in the center.\n- Other cabbage plants are in the upper portion and corners, partially cropped from the frame, establishing a repeating pattern.\n- The soil is visible at the bottom, sides, and between the leaves.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The image is realistic, photographic in nature, without stylization.\n- The composition emphasizes natural, organic forms, and the irregular overlap of leaves.\n- Lighting is natural, diffuse—no harsh shadows.\n- The lines (leaf veins, edges) are irregular and organic rather than geometric.\n- There are no signs of abstraction or digital stylization.\n\n**5. Any Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- There is no text or symbolic imagery in or overlaid on the image.\n- Details to note for SVG recreation:\n    - Each leaf shape should be unique and irregular, with undulating contour and visible veins.\n    - The main plant comprises a cluster of 12-16 overlapping leaves, layered from largest outside to smallest at the center.\n    - Outer leaves are more splayed and may touch the ground; the central 4-6 leaves are upright and more tightly coiled.\n    - Veins radiate out from the base toward the tips, with several main veins splitting into thinner ones.\n    - Leaf edges show slight bite-marks or holes.\n    - Colors should gradient subtly from the base to tip and from outer to inner leaves, with more yellow-brown on outer, soil-touching leaves.\n    - The outermost leaves can cover up to 80% of the length and width of the central area, with the innermost core occupying about 20-25%.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for SVG Design:**  \n- Use a series of broad, undulating ellipse or polygon shapes for leaves, layered concentrically.\n- Overlay branching bezier curves for leaf veins, varying in thickness and length.\n- Set fill gradients from greenish-blue to yellow-brown on outermost leaves, brighter green toward the center.\n- Main cabbage size: occupies roughly 65% of the image canvas; surrounding cabbages, only the upper quarters, are shown in partial shapes.\n- Add rough, uneven edge paths and a few small circular \"bite\" holes on outer leaf layers.\n- Background: brown fill for soil, visible between leaves.\n\nNo text or graphical symbols.

  "v1_198": "Certainly! Here is a detailed description of the image, focusing on all features except the blurred face area:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- **Central Figure:** The image features a half-length portrait of a person in a classical pose, shown from slightly below the shoulders up.\n- **Wig:** The most prominent element is an elaborate, voluminous judge’s or periwig, characteristic of 17th–18th-century European attire. The wig consists of multiple tight, rounded curls that cascade symmetrically down both sides of the head and shoulders, forming an approximately triangular shape that widens toward the base.\n- **Clothing:** The figure wears a dark, draped garment—likely a robe or coat—with a visible white cravat or shirt underneath. The garment forms a V shape at the neck, with the cravat ruffled downward from the top center.\n- **Background:** The background is a simple, lightly textured gradient, created by closely-spaced parallel lines that radiate outward in a curved pattern, forming a subtle oval framing the figure.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Color Palette:** The image is monochromatic, rendered in shades of black, white, and gray, consistent with traditional engraving or etching techniques.\n- **Textures:** \n  - The wig is highly textured, with fine, tightly packed lines creating a sense of dense, soft curls, each curl appearing almost individually delineated by curved and spiral lines.\n  - The robe or coat uses longer, crosshatched strokes to give a matte, textured fabric appearance.\n  - The cravat or shirt is depicted with lighter, smoother lines, suggesting softer fabric with subtle folds.\n  - The background texture is fine and evenly distributed, providing smooth tonal gradation without distracting from the main figure.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Framing and Proportions:**\n  - The figure is centered, occupying the majority of the image’s vertical space—about 80% heightwise and 60% widthwise.\n  - The wig extends horizontally almost to the edges of the frame at shoulder height but narrows toward the top to fit the head’s natural shape.\n  - The clothing and chest area broaden toward the base, giving the figure a solid, pyramid-like presence.\n- **Layering:**\n  - The wig overlaps the robe and cravat, sitting atop all other elements in the visual hierarchy.\n  - The robe and cravat details emerge from beneath the wig, with the robe forming the lowest layer in the composition.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Technique:** The drawing is executed in an engraved or etched style, with precise, linear strokes and cross-hatching to create shading and depth.\n- **Formality:** The overall effect is formal and classical, reminiscent of historical portraits found in old books, emphasizing realism via careful shading and meticulous rendering.\n- **Symmetry:** The image is nearly bilaterally symmetrical, especially in the arrangement of the wig curls and the drape of the clothing.\n\n**5. Any Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- **Absence of Text/Symbols:** There are no visible inscriptions, signatures, borders, or symbols in the visible area.\n- **Distinctive Details:**\n  - The wig’s individual ringlets are defined with tight, spiral curls, clustered in thick sections especially over the shoulders where several curls appear stacked or layered.\n  - The clothing features a crisp, central fold at the base of the neck, with broad, dark lapels implied by strong shadowing at the shoulders.\n  - The cravat is composed of several soft, rounded folds, descending from beneath the chin area and spilling slightly over the robe.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric Details for SVG Recreation:**\n- **Wig:** Two mirrored masses of overlapping spirals/curls, each curl sized ≈ 1/20th head height, range from the top of the head to the lower shoulders.\n- **Clothing:** Lower half consisting of a broad \"V\" with the stem at the neck (cravat) and the arms of the \"V\" forming the robe lapels; lapels extend beyond the wig curls.\n- **Background:** Oval/ellipse-shaped hatch pattern around the entire figure, fading outward for a vignette effect.\n- **Angles:** Shoulders slope gently downward from the neck at approximately 20–25°.\n\nThis breakdown should allow for precise and faithful SVG reconstruction of the image.",
  "v1_199": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description of the image, excluding any reference to the blurred face:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The central object is a stone or bronze statue of a standing figure in traditional Chinese attire, shown from the mid-torso upward.\n- The figure’s hands are brought together in front of the chest, the right hand cupping the left in a classic gesture of respect or greeting.\n- Draped across the figure’s shoulders and chest is a robe with an ornate, patterned trim.\n- A long, narrow rectangular object resembling a tablet or ceremonial baton is positioned vertically, tucked under the figure’s right arm, with its top end visible above the arm.\n- The statue is positioned in front of a building with a traditional Chinese tiled roof and visible beams.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- The statue has a uniform, weathered gray-green patina characteristic of aged bronze or stone.\n- The robe features carved details along the trim, possibly stylized clouds, floral, or geometric motifs.\n- The hands are well defined with visible knuckles and fingernails, indicating a focus on anatomical realism.\n- The background building shows a muted, reddish-brown roof with blue-gray undertones and ribbed vertical lines, likely ceramic roof tiles. The base of the roof, in the lower background, is accented by vertical cylindrical elements (roof ends).\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The figure is centrally located, occupying most of the vertical and horizontal midsection of the image.\n- The arms are bent at the elbows, with forearms almost parallel and hands centered at the solar plexus level.\n- The baton/tablet under the right arm is vertical, its bottom end hidden by the sleeve and torso, and its top protruding just above the robe’s edge.\n- The background consists of the roofline at the upper third, receding horizontally, with decorative elements blurred at the far left and right sides.\n- No other objects are present in the immediate foreground or beside the statue.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The sculpture is realistic but slightly stylized, employing smooth, continuous forms with selectively detailed features (hands, robe trim).\n- The posture, robe style, and ornamental trim suggest traditional Chinese statuary, likely representing a historical or scholarly figure.\n- The scene has a formal, symmetrical composition with the statue perfectly centered.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- There is no visible text or inscription.\n- The robe’s ornamental trim consists of repeated, shallowly carved circular or spiral patterns.\n- The baton/tablet under the right arm has a lightly textured grip, suggesting a wrapped or engraved surface.\n- The background roofline features a grid of ridged tiles with slight color variations and subtle organic patterning — faint greenish spots hint at moss or patina.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout for SVG Recreation:**\n\n- The statue should be centered horizontally in the SVG.\n- Shoulders form a broad, slightly rounded trapezoid, with the overall width roughly 2.5 times the head’s width.\n- The vertical centerline of the figure aligns with the hands, which are horizontally centered.\n- The height from the base (where the elbows are cropped) to the top of the head is about 1.8–2 times the shoulder width.\n- Arms drop at approximately 70° angles from horizontal before bending at the elbow so that forearms meet at about 20–30° from horizontal, forming a triangular shape with the hands as the apex.\n- The baton/tablet: Rectangle approx 1:5 width/height ratio, overlaying the right chest/shoulder, protruding above the sleeve by about 10–15% of its total height.\n- Robe neckline forms a shallow ‘V’, with decorative trim 5–10% of the torso width.\n- Background: Roof occupies upper quarter to third of the area, parallel horizontal lines for roof tiles, breaking into rough vertical ribs.\n- At the bottom and background edges, elements are softly blurred and not sharply defined.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe composition should use balanced symmetry, smooth curves for the robe and arms, and precise detailing for the ornamental patterns on the robe and the texture on the baton. The colors should stay within subdued, weathered grays and greens for the statue, with muted reds and gray-blues for the background roof. No text or overt symbols are present, but the robe’s trim and vertical tablet are key identifying details.",

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Title Texts:**\n  - At the top: *\"Units Of electricity by fuel source in Australia\"* (centered)\n  - Below the first pair of charts: *\"Units of electricity by fuel source in France\"* (centered)\n- **Layout:**\n  - Two main sections (Australia / France), top and bottom, each with two pie charts arranged horizontally (left: 1980, right: 2000).\n- **Pie Charts:** Four circular, 3D-styled pie charts:\n  - **Australia 1980** (top-left)\n  - **Australia 2000** (top-right)\n  - **France 1980** (bottom-left)\n  - **France 2000** (bottom-right)\n- **Legend/Key:** In the France charts, a small color legend box on the right side of each pie chart pair.\n- **Labels:** Each segment is labeled with a number (representing units of electricity).\n- **Annotations:** Below each pie chart, the year and total production appear as caption-like text.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Pie Chart Segment Colors:**\n  - **Natural Gas:** Dark blue (#203864)\n  - **Oil:** Yellow (#FFD700)\n  - **Coal:** Green (#8BC34A)\n  - **Nuclear Power:** Brown (#8D5524)\n  - **Hydro Power:** Red (#D32F2F)\n- **Chart Background:** Light gray with diagonal line texture.\n- **Pie Chart Shadows:** Soft black/gray shadow directly under each pie chart, enhancing the 3D effect.\n- **Numbers inside Slices:** White bold font, centered in each appropriate slice.\n- **Legend Boxes:** Small square color blocks (in correct color order), aligned vertically next to the labels with matching color text.\n- **Text Colors:** Title and section titles are teal. Pie chart labels, years, and production notes use dark gray.\n- **Highlighted Slices:** In 2000 charts, very small (2-unit) slices (Natural Gas & Hydro Power) are visually separated (\"exploded\") from the main pie to emphasize their size.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Overall Layout:**\n  - The image is vertically divided into two major sections, each with two charts side by side, and centered section titles between the groups.\n- **Alignment:**\n  - Pie charts within each section are of equal size and height-aligned horizontally.\n  - Titles are horizontally centered above each major section.\n- **White/Margin Space:** Generous, especially between chart pairs and above/below text.\n- **Slice Proportions:**\n  - All pies are sized identically; slices are sized proportionally to their numbers/values. Each pie slice is a sector of the circle whose angle corresponds to the proportion of the total units produced.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Charts:** 3D pie charts with subtle vertical offsets/shadows to create a raised, tactile look. The exploded (pulled-out) slices in 2000 charts add interest and clarity.\n- **Text:** Modern, sans-serif font, clear and high-contrast (for labels and values inside the pie slices).\n- **Legend (France only):** Simple and minimalist, matching the colors of the pie segments. Each color has a matching text label.\n- **Figure Background:** Off-white with a light, almost imperceptible, diagonal pattern for contrast.\n- **Pie Chart Outlines:** Pie chart sections have faint, thin, white outlines for separation.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n\n- **Sign Details**:\n    - Each sign is a white rectangle (approx. 1.5x the height of the produce it's embedded in), with thick blue/black handwritten prices in large script (e.g., “7.00”, “8.00”, “15.00”), generally with a period decimal separator.\n    - Smaller, uppercase script above/below the price gives the produce name (e.g., “DOMATES”, “ARMUT”, “ELMA”, “MANDALINA”, etc.)\n    - In some cases, extra notes beneath the price (e.g., “TATLI”, or “NET”, generally ~half the height of the main price font).\n    - The signs have visible narrow stick supports, most angled towards the camera but not perfectly perpendicular to the produce surface.\n- **Fruit Wrappings**:\n    - Some fruits (mainly light yellow pears and lemons) have protective netting–drawn as a white, slightly translucent mesh wrapping around the lower two-thirds of each fruit.\n- **Leaf Details**:\n    - Many piles accentuate with decorative sprigs of green leaves, poked among the fruit, especially among the citrus and at foreground layer edges.\n\n---\n\n**Proportions and Layout for SVG Recreation**:\n\n- Divide the layout in a roughly 4x4 grid to place citrus, apples, pears, and vegetables.\n- For round produce, use circles with diameter ratios: oranges/lemons ~1.5x the diameter of grapes; apples/pears ~1.2x orange size; strawberries as heart-shaped or teardrop-like with a leafy flat top.\n- Cauliflower heads: large white/beige circles, surrounded by green polylines for leaves.\n- Net-wrapped fruit: overlay thin criss-cross lines (mesh) in a lighter color over yellow/white circles.\n- Signs: rectangles (vertical orientation), placed into produce with the bottom edge masked for an embedded look. Each has three text lines of varying size, top (name), middle (large price), bottom (descriptor).\n- Grapes: clusters of small overlapping circles on short curved lines (\"vines\"), grouped in bunches.\n- Bananas: slightly arched elongated ellipses, grouped in a narrow fan.\n- Peppers: a trapezoidal base with a curved elongated dome for each pepper, overlapping for stacking effect.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n\nA densely packed, colorful market fruit and vegetable display, with orderly mounds of vividly colored produce (circles and ellipses), diagonal orientation, hand-written white sign cards stuck vertically among each group, and net-wrapped fruits providing subtle visual variation. Strong, naturalistic lighting and visible leaf/greenery accents increase depth and realism. The composition has no visible background between items, maximizing the sense of bounty and variety. The entire image is characterized by repeated geometric forms, orderly rows, close crops, and a lively palette.",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- **Orientation**:\n    - The scene is viewed slightly from above, offering a clear view of most piles’ surfaces.\n    - Produce is arranged in a generally left-to-right descending diagonal (from upper left down to lower right).\n- **Proportions**:\n    - Each fruit/veg is roughly anatomically proportioned (perfect circles for citrus; elongated ellipses for cucumbers/bananas).\n    - Produce piles range from approximately 3–6 items wide and 4–6 items long per visible group.\n- **Layout** (from left to right and top to bottom):\n    - **Upper Left:** Green chili peppers and red bell peppers, above stacked cauliflowers.\n    - **Upper Center:** Bell peppers of yellow-green-red, base tomatoes.\n    - **Upper Right:** Apples (red and green), pears/yellow fruit, netted and loose.\n    - **Lower Left:** Tomatoes (many varieties), cucumbers, some plums.\n    - **Lower Center:** Kiwis, oranges, grapes clustered throughout.\n    - **Lower Right:** Lemons, bananas, more oranges and grape bunches, foreground strawberries.\n- **Sign Placement**: Signs are evenly distributed, one per main produce group, mostly upright or angled, always stuck into the associated produce.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic appearance**\n- **High color contrast and brightness**, reminiscent of market or grocery settings.\n- **Compositional symmetry**: Strong sense of order, almost as if produce was carefully aligned for display.\n- **No clear gridlines**: While items are organized, they overlap slightly, emphasizing abundance.\n- **Hand-drawn text on the signs** conveys a casual, human touch (wavy lines, imperfect edges).\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n\n- **Sign Details**:\n    - Each sign is a white rectangle (approx. 1.5x the height of the produce it's embedded in), with thick blue/black handwritten prices in large script (e.g., “7.00”, “8.00”, “15.00”), generally with a period decimal separator.\n    - Smaller, uppercase script above/below the price gives the produce name (e.g., “DOMATES”, “ARMUT”, “ELMA”, “MANDALINA”, etc.)\n    - In some cases, extra notes beneath the price (e.g., “TATLI”, or “NET”, generally ~half the height of the main price font).\n    - The signs have visible narrow stick supports, most angled towards the camera but not perfectly perpendicular to the produce surface.\n- **Fruit Wrappings**:\n    - Some fruits (mainly light yellow pears and lemons) have protective netting–drawn as a white, slightly translucent mesh wrapping around the lower two-thirds of each fruit.\n- **Leaf Details**:\n    - Many piles accentuate with decorative sprigs of green leaves, poked among the fruit, especially among the citrus and at foreground layer edges.\n\n---\n\n**Proportions and Layout for SVG Recreation**:\n\n- Divide the layout in a roughly 4x4 grid to place citrus, apples, pears, and vegetables.\n- For round produce, use circles with diameter ratios: oranges/lemons ~1.5x the diameter of grapes; apples/pears ~1.2x orange size; strawberries as heart-shaped or teardrop-like with a leafy flat top.\n- Cauliflower heads: large white/beige circles, surrounded by green polylines for leaves.\n- Net-wrapped fruit: overlay thin criss-cross lines (mesh) in a lighter color over yellow/white circles.\n- Signs: rectangles (vertical orientation), placed into produce with the bottom edge masked for an embedded look. Each has three text lines of varying size, top (name), middle (large price), bottom (descriptor).\n- Grapes: clusters of small overlapping circles on short curved lines (\"vines\"), grouped in bunches.\n- Bananas: slightly arched elongated ellipses, grouped in a narrow fan.\n- Peppers: a trapezoidal base with a curved elongated dome for each pepper, overlapping for stacking effect.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n\nA densely packed, colorful market fruit and vegetable display, with orderly mounds of vividly colored produce (circles and ellipses), diagonal orientation, hand-written white sign cards stuck vertically among each group, and net-wrapped fruits providing subtle visual variation. Strong, naturalistic lighting and visible leaf/greenery accents increase depth and realism. The composition has no visible background between items, maximizing the sense of bounty and variety. The entire image is characterized by repeated geometric forms, orderly rows, close crops, and a lively palette.",

  "v1_27": "Certainly! Here is a **detailed, precise, and comprehensive description** of the image, suitable for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- The image shows a cross-sectional view of a sphere (the Earth), illustrating the Earth's internal structure by revealing its four concentric layers.\n- The left half of the sphere is shaded to represent the Earth's surface (crust and visible continents), while the right half is removed (cutaway), exposing the interior layers.\n- Four nested shapes (rings/ovals), each smaller and inside the previous one, represent the Earth's layers.\n- Each layer is indicated with a number (1, 2, 3, or 4), placed centrally or close to its respective zone.\n- A horizontal arrow labeled \"1\" points to the outermost concentric ring.\n- Below the diagram is a rectangular table with two columns: “Layer” and “Number on figure 1”. Four rows are present for the Earth's four layers.\n- Above the diagram is captioned text and a question instructing the viewer to identify the numbers for each layer.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, Visual Properties**\n\n- The main objects are outlined in **black thin lines** on a white background (grayscale).\n- **Left hemisphere (Earth surface):**\n  - Filled with medium and dark grey irregular patches to represent continents and ocean.\n- **Interior layers (right hemisphere, cutaway):**\n  - Four concentric ovals/circles (from outside to inside): each is outlined in black, not filled with color (remains white except for line work).\n- **Arrow:**\n  - Thin, solid black line with a filled arrowhead, pointing inward from the right margin to the crust layer.\n- **Numbers “1,” “2,” “3,” “4”:**\n  - Black numerals, placed centrally in each respective layer.\n- **Text and Table:**\n  - All text, grid lines, and captions are black, sans-serif, and are clearly legible.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Sphere Position:** Centered horizontally, occupying the upper middle part of the image.\n- **Division of sphere:** The sphere is split cleanly down the center vertically; the left half shows surface shading, the right half reveals the internal layers.\n- **Concentric Layers:**\n  - Four evenly-nested ovals or circles, each decreasing proportionally in size, and all share a common center. (For SVG: share same center, each inside the previous by a consistent margin.)\n  - Outermost (crust), next in (mantle), next in (outer core), smallest center (inner core).\n- **Numerical Labels:**\n  - “1” is at the outermost ring, with an arrow pointing from the right, labeling it.\n  - “2” is placed within the second, just inside the crust.\n  - “3” is next, inside the “mantle” layer.\n  - “4” is at the very center of the sphere, in the smallest inner core circle.\n- **Table Position:**\n  - Below the diagram (well separated), clearly distinct, horizontally aligned.\n- **Text Position:**\n  - The instruction and heading “Figure 1 shows the structure…” are at the very top.\n  - The caption “Figure 1” is immediately below the diagram, above the table.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Style:** Schematic, scientific, and diagrammatic. No shading or gradients inside the sectional layers; only flat fills (earth surface). Meant for clarity and educational use.\n- **Shape Accuracy:**\n  - All layers are depicted as perfect circles/ellipses, proportionally concentric.\n  - The cutaway is exact, as if a hemisphere has been cleanly sliced away.\n- **No Decorative Elements:** The diagram is purely functional; no stylized or decorative additions.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n\n- **Figure Numbers:**\n  - Arrow labeled with a bold “1” is slightly outside the crust, pointing to the outermost ring from the right.\n  - “2” is within the next layer, “3” the next, “4” at the center.\n- **Instructional Text:** At top left:\n  - “Figure 1 shows the structure of the earth’s interior. Write the number showing each layer in the table below.”\n- **Table Content:**\n  - Column 1 (left): \n    - Outer core\n    - Mantle\n    - Crust\n    - Inner core\n  - Column 2 (right): titled “Number on figure 1”, empty for the user to fill.\n- **Caption:** Below image: “Figure 1”\n- **Page Number:** (“(4)”) bottom right of the table in small font.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, Layout:**\n\n- **Sphere:** Circle approximately 2.5x diameter of each largest layer’s inner circle.\n- **Concentric Rings:** Each subsequent inner ring about 65-70% radius of the outer ring, with margin sufficient to easily contain their respective numerals.\n- **Arrow:** Horizontal, about twice the width of the space between outer ring and right edge of diagram.\n- **Table:** Width matches or exceeds the sphere’s, consisting of two equally-sized columns and four rows, each row of uniform height, with bold column headings.\n- **Number Placement:** Centered within each ring except the “1” (crust), which is outside with an arrow targeting the outermost border.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Number-Layer Correspondence (for clarity):**\n\n- 1 = Crust (outermost)\n- 2 = Mantle (next in)\n- 3 = Outer core (next in)\n- 4 = Inner core (center)\n\n---\n\nIf you need proportions or SVG code, this describes exactly what to draw and where to place each element.

  "v1_30": "Certainly! Here is a precise, detailed description of the image you provided, intended for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Two jet fighter aircraft** dominate the composition, specifically F-14 Tomcats (known for their distinctive variable-sweep wings and twin tails). The main aircraft is close to the foreground, occupying most of the image, while the second aircraft is at mid-distance, flying at a similar altitude.\n    - Both planes have a pointed nose, bubble canopy (tandem seating for two crew), two vertical stabilizers (fins) on each rear, and two afterburners/exhaust nozzles at the rear.\n    - The **swept-back wings** are broadly triangular, with varying sweep angles and smaller control surfaces visible.\n    - Underside pods and missiles are visible mounted under the wings/fuselage.\n\n- **Background:** A dramatic mid/high-altitude sky dense with soft, fluffy clouds. The ocean surface is visible far below, with glints of golden sunlight reflecting off the water.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Aircraft:**\n    - Predominantly **light gray/silver** metallic surfaces, with subtle weathering (scuffs, slight discoloration, darker panel lines).\n    - **Black accents:** U.S. Navy insignia, squadron markings, \"101\" in black on the nose.\n    - **Yellow warning stencils** and dark lines for panel separation.\n    - **Canopy:** Transparent dark glass, revealing just enough suggestion of pilots.\n    - **Jet exhausts:** Darkened, almost black interiors with metallic rims.\n\n- **Clouds:** Soft, pale cream/white clouds tinged with warm golden light, especially in the direction of the sun.\n\n- **Sunlight:** Overall color is warm with golden/yellow tint, especially where sunlight directly hits the tops of the wings, clouds, and ocean below.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Main Jet:** Positioned from the left bottom edge toward the right upper edge, angled such that its left rear is closest to the viewer, showing most of the left fuselage, left wings, and vertical stabilizers.\n    - The aircraft stretches diagonally with the nose pointing about 30º above the right horizon.\n    - **Proportions:** Twin tails approximately 1/3 the length of the body from the rear; wingspan is wider than the body length due to sweep.\n    - The right wing is foreshortened due to the viewing angle.\n\n- **Secondary Jet:** Secondary F-14 is positioned farther in the mid-background, upper left quadrant, following a parallel trajectory.\n    - Smaller in apparent size (roughly 1/3-1/2 the visual size of the main aircraft), following the main.\n    - Wings show less sweep than the front jet—suggesting a slightly different flight phase.\n\n- **Scene Depth:** Cloud layer begins a little less than halfway down from the top, with the ocean visible between cloud gaps below.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photo-realistic style:** Detailed textures, accurate shading, and realistic light interaction on metal surfaces and clouds.\n- **Soft gradients:** The sky and clouds blend smoothly with no harsh outlines; the sunlight scatter causes soft, diffuse shadows.\n- **High detail:** Visible rivets, seams, panel lines on aircraft; multiple onboard markings and stencils.\n- **Dynamic composition:** Slight sense of motion implied by jet position and angle, dramatic lighting for visual impact.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n\n- **Markings on main jet:**\n    - **Vertical stabilizer (Tail fin):**\n        - Black diamond-shaped insignia enclosing:\n            - \"A\" at top, \"41\" in large digits center, \"A\" at bottom.\n            - Words: \"BLACK\" (left of diamond), \"ACES\" (right of diamond)\n            - Below diamond: \"USS ENTERPRISE\"\n    - **Fuselage near cockpit:**\n        - \"101\" (bold, black, large, just behind nose cone)\n        - US Navy roundel (black star-and-bars insignia)\n        - Smaller stencils (e.g., \"RESCUE\" with an arrow, yellow/black caution markings)\n    - **Fuselage aft:**\n        - Large faint letters \"NAVY\" and \"VF-41\" vertically aligned.\n    - **Wing and flap edges:** Subtle yellow, orange, and black caution lines.\n    - **Under wing pod:** Faint text, possibly “F-14A” and “FIGHTER”.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout\n\n- **Main Jet:**\n    - **Fuselage:** Proportional length to wingspan approx. 1 (length): 1.2 (wings swept out).\n    - **Cockpit canopy:** Roughly 1/5 body length, elliptical with a raised section aft for RIO (Radar Intercept Officer).\n    - **Wings:** Variable geometry; in this view, swept between 50–65 degrees relative to the centerline.\n    - **Tail fins:** Two, diverging outwards at ~15°, at the far rear quarters of the plane.\n    - **Jet intakes:** Trapezoidal, located ~1/3 back from the nose behind cockpit.\n\n- **Relative Positioning:**\n    - Main plane takes up ~65% of horizontal image width; up to 60% of image height (including wings).\n    - Second plane: located in top mid-left; wings almost parallel to main plane.\n    - Cloud tops fill lower 2/3 of frame; sun direction from right/top, creating strong highlights and soft shadows.\n    - Ocean (lower background) has a faint grid-like reflection from sunlight.\n\n---\n\nThis description should allow an SVG artist to reconstruct the image with a high degree of fidelity.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- **Bars:** \n  - The three bars are evenly spaced horizontally, with the tallest (leftmost), mid-height (center), and shortest (rightmost).\n  - All bars share the same baseline (bottom y-position).\n- **Relative Heights:**\n  - **Ford F150 (left)**: The tallest bar, approximately 1.8 times the height of the shortest.\n  - **Toyota RAV4 (center)**: About 1.2 times the height of the Honda Civic, but significantly shorter than the Ford F150.\n  - **Honda Civic (right)**: The shortest bar.\n- **Labels:** \n  - Car model names are directly beneath each bar, center-aligned to the bar. \n  - \"Ford F150\" label has two lines: \"Ford F150\" in black, \"(Regular Cab)\" in smaller, light gray below it.\n  - The other two have two lines each as well: first line is the brand, second line is the model, all in black.\n- **Values:** \n  - Centered near the top edge within each bar, sufficiently below the top to avoid touching it.\n- **Summary Line and Text:** \n  - Below the bars and labels, a thick magenta horizontal line spans the width of the chart.\n  - Beneath this line, centered, is the bold text: \"Total fueling cost\".\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Overall style:** Modern, flat design, no shading or gradients, just solid blocks of color.\n- **Rectangular geometry:** All bars are perfect rectangles with straight, vertical sides and flat tops.\n- **Font:** A clean, modern, sans-serif font (such as Roboto or Arial).\n- **Emphasis:** \n  - The use of magenta/purple for bars and the separator line adds vibrancy.\n  - The summary label is in bold for prominence.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n\n- **Inside Bars:**\n  - Left bar: \"$130.96\"\n  - Middle bar: \"$82.56\"\n  - Right bar: \"$70.55\"\n  - Each value is in white, bold or semi-bold, centered near top.\n- **Under Bars:**\n  - Left (below bar): \"Ford F150\" (black, two lines), smaller/light gray: \"(Regular Cab)\"\n  - Middle: \"Toyota\" (line 1), \"RAV4\" (line 2); both black.\n  - Right: \"Honda\" (line 1), \"Civic\" (line 2); both black.\n- **Summary Below Line:**\n  - Bold, black text: \"Total fueling cost\"\n\n---\n\n**6. Geometric Details and Proportions:**\n\n- **Bar Widths:** All bars the same width (about 1/7 of total image width).\n- **Spacing:** Small, equal horizontal gap between bars (about 1/20 of image width).\n- **Bar Heights:** Proportional to the values:\n    - If the shortest bar (Honda Civic) is set at height X, middle bar (Toyota RAV4) is ~1.17X, tallest bar (Ford F150) is ~1.86X.\n- **Text Positioning:** \n    - Values inside bars: ~10-15% below top edge.\n    - Category labels: ~10% bar width beneath bar’s bottom.\n    - The “(Regular Cab)” line is smaller and slightly lighter than main bar label, tucked directly beneath \"Ford F150\".\n- **Bottom Label:** Horizontal magenta line, about 6-8 pixels thick, stretching across the chart width with “Total fueling cost” below, centered.\n\n---\n\n**7. Layout information for SVG:**\n\n- **Overall SVG aspect ratio:** Vertical rectangle, roughly 3:4 (w:h)\n- **Bars:** \n    - Place in <g> group\n    - Rectangles, with heights proportional to 130.96, 82.56, 70.55.\n    - Uniform width for all bars.\n    - Consistent gap between bars.\n- **Text:**\n    - Use <text> for all labels, proper x/y positioning for centering.\n    - Use <tspan> for line breaks in category labels; <tspan> with reduced font size and lighter color for “(Regular Cab)”.\n    - Use text-anchor=\"middle\" for centering text horizontally.\n    - Font size for values larger than for labels.\n- **Separator line:** \n    - <rect> or <line> element (magenta), height 6-8 pixels, full width.\n    - Text below, centered.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThis bar chart contains three vivid magenta/purple vertical bars, each labeled below with car model names (with the first including a second, lighter line for \"Regular Cab\"), and the fueling cost value in white inside each bar at the top. The chart is clean, geometric, and flat-styled for modern visual clarity, with all elements proportionally spaced and a bolded summary line and heading beneath.\n\nLet me know if you’d like an SVG code template based on this!",

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- The image is a **grouped column/bar chart** visualizing the rise in UK household energy costs over several quarters and years, with industry forecasts for the coming quarters.\n- There are **eight vertical bar groups**:\n  - Five bars on the left (actual historic data, Q4-Q1 2020/2021 to Q4 2022)\n  - Four bars on the right, separated and boxed, labeled “Industry forecasts” (Q1-Q4 2023)\n- Each bar is **stacked**, comprising up to three visible color-coded segments, representing:\n  - Standing charges (Bottom section)\n  - Gas price per kWh (Middle)\n  - Electricity price per kWh (Top)\n- The legend in the upper left uses colored squares to denote the three categories.\n- There are multiple **text labels**: numbers on bar segments, total values above bars, axes titles, and chart title.\n- The right four bars are enclosed in a light box to emphasize “Industry forecasts”.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n**Legend Colors:**\n- Standing charges: light green (#d3e6cb)\n- Gas price/kWh: muted lavender (#d5cdd9)\n- Electricity price/kWh: tan/orange (#edcfa5)\n\n**Bar Segment Colors:**\n- The left five bars use a lot of the green and lavender shades; the right forecast bars are tan/orange.\n\n**General Visual Style:**\n- **Flat, solid colors** for segments.\n- White background.\n- Black and dark grey sans-serif text (header and labels).\n- No gridlines or axes, just values on the bars.\n- The forecast bars have a faint light box behind them (slightly off-white).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n#### Bar Groups:\n\n- **Left section:** Five bars, evenly spaced horizontally, begin at the left and occupy about 55% of the width.\n- **Right section:** Four forecast bars, set inside a rectangle box, occupy the remaining 45% on the right.\n\n#### Bar Heights/Proportions:\n\n- Each bar is sized to illustrate the annual cost (total in bold above each bar).\n- Each bar stack shows (bottom to top): standing charge; gas price; then electricity price.\n- Each segment’s height is proportional to the respective value (as per numbers within them).\n- Leftmost bar is shortest (Q4-Q1 2020/21). Final forecast bar (Q2 2023) is tallest.\n- Industry forecast bars are noticeably taller than the historic bars.\n\n#### Bar/Legend Relationship:\n\n- Legend is positioned in the upper left, left-aligned near the chart area.\n- Legend has three colored small squares in a row, each with a label right-aligned to it.\n\n#### Text Labels:\n\n- Chart title and subtitle at the top, centered above chart.\n- Values are centered within each segment (in matching text color), and the total per bar is bold and centered above the bar.\n- The forecast box is labeled “Industry forecasts” at the top center of the box.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- The image is a *vertical flowchart* for lamp troubleshooting.\n- The flow consists of **six main elements**: one rounded rectangle (start), two diamonds (decisions), and three rounded rectangles (actions).\n- **Arrows/triangle pointers** connect and direct the flow.\n\n**Specific elements in top-to-bottom order:**\n\n1. **Start Block:**  \n   - Shape: Horizontally stretched, rounded rectangle.\n   - Edge radius: Gentle (~1/8 the height).\n   - Centered at the top.\n\n2. **First Decision Block:**  \n   - Shape: Diamond (equal width and height, tilted square, 45°).\n   - Pointing vertically downwards (points top, right, bottom, left).\n   - Placed directly below the start block, center-aligned.\n\n3. **Second Decision Block:**  \n   - Same as above—diamond, identical size.\n   - Vertically aligned below the first diamond.\n\n4. **Three Action Blocks:**  \n   - All are horizontally elongated rounded rectangles (similar proportion/style to the start block).\n   - One is directly below the second diamond, center-aligned.\n   - The other two are horizontally aligned (\"branches\") to the right of each diamond.\n\n5. **Directional Flow:**\n   - Black arrows connect the blocks sequentially:\n     - Vertical arrows between center-aligned blocks (downward).\n     - Rightward arrows for the action branches at each decision.\n   - Arrows are **filled white triangles** with a black stroke (not simple lines).\n   - All arrows are centered on their source/target sides.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- *Background*: Transparent (no fill).\n- *Borders*: All shapes have a solid black stroke.\n- *Fill colors*:\n  - Start block: **Light pink** (#f4cccc).\n  - Decision blocks (diamonds): **Pale yellow** (#ffff99).\n  - Action blocks: **Pastel green** (#99e699).\n  - Arrows: **White** fill, black stroke.\n- *Text*: Solid black, centered in each shape.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- All blocks are *vertically aligned* except for the two \"Yes\" action branches, which are positioned to the **right** of each respective diamond block.\n- There is consistent **vertical spacing** between stacked blocks.\n- Both diamonds are larger than the rectangles (to fit similar font size within the slanted shape).\n- The arrows go from the bottom/side center of one shape to the top/side center of the next.\n- The diamonds sit with their vertical axes aligned with the rectangles.\n- Horizontal action blocks are flush/level with the middle of the diamond.\n- *Proportions*: Rectangles are roughly 2:1 (width:height). Diamonds are roughly square-shaped but rotated.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Simple, clear flowchart style**: No 3D effects, gradients, or shadows.\n- **Rounded corners** on all rectangles.\n- **High contrast** between text and background for readability.\n- **Consistent stroke weight** across all shapes and arrows.\n- **Sufficient spacing** inside shapes for text.\n\n---\n\n**5.

  "v1_64": "Certainly! Below is a comprehensive, geometric- and detail-oriented description for an SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- Two human figures side-by-side, facing forward, each occupying approximately half of the image.\n- Both figures are visible from mid-torso upwards, centered vertically in the frame.\n- Each figure has distinct hair textures, and wears a different style of dress.\n- The background is divided vertically at the center, with visually contrasting left and right halves.\n  \n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Left Figure:**\n  - Dress: Pale yellow, semi-sheer fabric with a soft tulle texture overlay, subtle vertical pleating, slightly gathered waist, short, slightly puffed tulle sleeves.\n  - Hair: Long, with a crimped/wavy texture, chestnut brown color, thick volume, parted in the center and falling broadly over the shoulders.\n  - Necklace: Two-tiered, silver chain necklaces; top chain is a simple curve, lower chain features a silver/metallic cross pendant.\n  - Background: Deep charcoal or black, smooth, matte finish. White text visible in all caps serif font (\"THE CINEMA...\") located behind the head and upper body.\n- **Right Figure:**\n  - Dress: White, shiny satin or silk with a dense botanical print. Print includes a variety of pink, red, and green flowers and stems of differing sizes spread throughout. Short, fitted sleeves; bodice is closely tailored with slight curvature for shoulders.\n  - Hair: Cut to just above shoulder length, smooth, straight texture, parted slightly off center, dark blond to light brown with subtle highlights.\n  - Background: Pale gray or off-white, finely textured with light sketched/illustrated lines resembling architectural or mural elements.\n  \n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- Each figure is centrally positioned in their respective half, standing upright, symmetrical.\n- Both have their shoulders visible close to the bottom margin, with heads extending nearly to the top.\n- The vertical dividing line is straight, splitting the image cleanly in two.\n- The left background text is mostly above and to the right of the figure’s head, partially obscured by hair. The right side background has lighter, lower-contrast patterns more evenly dispersed and not directly behind the figure.\n  \n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The photographic style is direct, fashion/editorial portraiture with even, soft lighting and clear, high-resolution detailing.\n- Color rendering is naturalistic but with high contrast between outfit and background in both halves.\n- The left side has a classic formal red carpet feel; the right side has a lighter, more whimsical mood due to the floral elements and pale background.\n- The juxtaposition of matte and shiny fabric finishes (left: matte tulle, right: glossy satin) is visually distinct.\n  \n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- Left background features visible white serif text: upper part “THE CINEMA SOC” (letters likely cropped by the image’s upper edge), lower left “MA...” partially visible.\n- Necklace cross pendant on the left figure is the only symbolic jewelry element.\n- Right figure’s dress print features detailed flowers with multiple petal shapes, leaves, and stems in various sizes and orientations. No visible jewelry.\n- There are distinctive seam lines and light folds on both dresses at the waist, giving subtle geometric cues for garment construction.\n- Both dresses’ sleeves end just above the elbow (left: loosely, with tulle transparency; right: fitted and opaque).\n- No text or symbols are present within the right background but implied light line-work creates visual interest.\n\n**Geometric/Proportional/Layout Details for SVG:**\n- Canvas ratio: 1:1 (square).\n- Each figure occupies roughly 45% of the horizontal space, leaving a narrow vertical center divide.\n- Shoulders span about 70% of each half’s width; head size is roughly 45% the height of their half.\n- Dress bodices start at about 30% from the top, waists at 55%, with skirt fabric visible to bottom edge.\n- The left background’s text is positioned ~10% below the top edge, spaced to avoid the figure’s crown.\n- The right background’s architectural lines start from the right margin, fade as they approach the center divide; floral patterns cover 90% of visible dress area, needing careful positioning and scaling.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further breakdowns (vectors for hair, dress convection, etc.) for the SVG file!",
  "v1_65": "Here is a detailed description of the image, tailored for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- Central figure: A standing person, framed from the head to the waist, positioned slightly off-center (closer to the left edge), holding an Oscar statuette in their right hand across their lower chest/waist area.\n- Oscar statuette: Classic Oscar shape, metallic tall human figure with arms crossed, mounted on a black, round base, held upright.\n- Outfit: Strapless or thin-strapped, white feathered or fringed elegant dress covering the upper torso and waist, with some feather details protruding at the edges. \n- Hair: Voluminous, long dark brown hair flowing over the left shoulder in loose waves, ornamented with a thin, sparkling headband (possibly diamond or rhinestone encrusted).\n- Hand gesture: Left hand is bent at the elbow, palm pressed to the upper chest/collarbone, with a visible ring on the ring finger and long, manicured fingernails.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- Dress: White, textural with feathery or fringed embellishments, reflecting light and creating a sense of movement and luxury.\n- Oscar statuette: Highly reflective, bright gold metallic finish, with a glossy black base.\n- Background: Out-of-focus, two wide, slightly diagonal golden brown stripes (suggesting a stage floor or runway) with slightly darker gaps between them, likely signifying the iconic Oscar stage.\n- Hair: Deep, rich brown with natural luster and highlights.\n- Accessories: Silver or white-gold headband (hair), dangling silver/diamond earrings, large prominent ring (possibly multi-stone), all highly reflective, with a formal, jewelry-like finish.\n- Skin: Light to medium flesh tones, smoothly lit, with realistic shading on arms and shoulders.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The person is centered vertically, occupying the lower ~65% of the image, with the Oscar statuette held across the body at a roughly diagonal angle from lower right to upper left.\n- Microphone: Black, cylindrical, bulb-topped, centered at the bottom of the image in front of the subject and slightly out of focus.\n- Background strips are angled diagonally (from top left to bottom right) providing a dynamic framing.\n- Right arm: Bent at the elbow, holding the statue close to the body.\n- Left hand: Resting flat against the upper chest.\n- Headband sits across the top of the hair, with ends slightly receding into the hair volume.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- Photorealistic, high-resolution imagery with shallow depth of field (sharp on subject, blurred background).\n- Lighting is warm, coming from above and slightly in front, generating natural skin highlights and clear, well-defined shadows on the body and objects.\n- The overall aesthetic is prestigious and glamorous, evoking an award ceremony setting.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- No visible text or signage in image.\n- Oscar statuette features subtle sculpted details (arms, torso, base rim) consistent with the actual award.\n- Manicure: Polished nails, light nude or pale color.\n- Earrings: Vertical, multi-stone drop style, reflecting light.\n- Dress details: Feathery/fine fringes radiate outward from fabric, especially near arm holes and torso edge.\n- Clear, thin, translucent shoulder straps add support to the dress but are nearly invisible.\n\n**Proportions and Layout (for SVG):**\n- Subject occupies ~60-65% of total image height; centered horizontally, favoring left by ~10%.\n- Oscar statuette is ~16% of total image height.\n- Microphone is ~12% of height, centered at the bottom.\n- Dress feathers/fringes extend out about 5–8% width from torso edge.\n- Golden diagonal stripes are ~30% the image width, evenly spaced.\n- Hair falls from crown to ~mid-bicep level on left side.\n\nThis description should provide a robust foundation for visually reconstructing the image into an SVG with accurate proportions, colors, and spatial relationships.",

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- Backgrounds vary and include hues such as magenta-pink (top left), black, lush green (indicative of foliage), warm gold-lit tones, and dark gray.\n- The clothing spans a range of colors: red with white details (middle left in the bottom row), classic black, white, light blue, and formal wear such as tuxedo jackets, blouses, and glittery/gem-studded dresses.\n- Several individuals have visible jewelry (such as necklaces, chains, and chokers), particularly bold and sparkly–notably pearls, gems, and chunky silver.\n- Hair textures are diverse: smooth and straight, gently waved, curly, parted in various ways (center, side), and in blonde, brunette, and jet-black colors.\n- Lighting varies–some subjects are brightly lit with soft shadows; others are more evenly lit, producing a clean studio feel.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- Each individual is centered within their respective rectangle, from the upper chest or neckline to the top edge, creating a composition designed for easy comparison.\n- Shoulders are typically parallel to the image edge, with clothing and hair taking up the lower half and background occupying the top.\n- Visible jewelry often sits just above or follows the neckline, with collars spreading slightly away from the neck.\n- In some portraits, accessories like earrings or earbuds are visible close to the head’s edge.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The presentation is collage-style, prioritizing symmetry and consistency in subject framing.\n- Most images have a glamour or celebrity red carpet aesthetic: crisp photography, controlled lighting, high color contrast, and polished appearances.\n- Cropping is tight around the head-and-shoulders area.\n- The blurred face area is a soft-edged, evenly colored rectangle, centrally placed within each portrait (excluded from detail per your instruction).\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- No visible overlay text, numbers, or symbolic icons are within the individual portrait rectangles.\n- In the image’s top row, backgrounds feature event logos or colored wall patterns, but only faint fragments (such as a partial magenta-pink letter on the top left).\n- In the grid, the yellow separation lines (about 2-3 pixels thick) are consistent, adding a neat, uniform structure.\n- Clothes and accessories include:\n    - Sequined red dress with a large, shiny necklace and clear gemstones (bottom row, second from left).\n    - Classic suit jacket with shirt collar (top row, fourth from left).\n    - Microphone (bottom left), indicating a performance setting.\n    - Chain-link or gemmed necklaces and simple hoop earrings.\n\n**6. Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout for SVG Recreation**\n- Aspect ratio of each rectangle roughly 4:5 (width:height).\n- Borders and separations: hairline-yellow is consistent, forming a clean grid; rectangles have no curvature (all angles are 90°).\n- The entire image has a rectangular layout, overall aspect ratio approximately 2:1 (width:height).\n- Portraits occupies most of the rectangle (head area from about 25% to 95% vertical space).\n- Jewelry lies close to the base edge or along the collarbone, typically within the bottom 15-30% of each rectangle’s vertical space.\n- Each subject’s head is centered laterally with small side margins for shoulders/hair.\n\n**Summary Table of Layout (for SVG reference):**\n- 2 rows × 5 columns grid\n- Rectangles fill the canvas with uniform yellow 2-3px gridlines\n- Each cell: head/shoulders portrait, unique background, jewelry, wardrobe details (no face features visible)\n- Some cells contain visible objects (microphone, earbuds, accessories)\n\nThis description should provide the structure and fine details required to recreate the image accurately as an SVG, focusing on composition, color, arrangement, and accessory details.",

  "v1_70": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive SVG-focused description of the image:\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- The central object is a shallow, round ceramic bowl filled with a dish consisting primarily of cubed tofu in a red, oily sauce, traditionally known as Mapo Tofu.\n- The tofu cubes are rectangular, roughly uniform in size (rectangular prisms), and fill most of the bowl’s surface area. There are approximately 18-24 visible tofu cubes.\n- Garnished centrally on top are several (about 5-7) slender, diagonal slices of green onion, grouped together.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Bowl**: Light off-white to beige with very subtle speckles/dots along the rim.\n- **Tofu Cubes**: Off-white to light cream, with slightly translucent, smooth surfaces. Some sides are stained or covered by the sauce, which adds orange-red highlights and patches.\n- **Sauce**: Bright to deep red coloration with an oily, glossy surface, speckled with tiny darker bits (indicating minced meat or spices). The oil separates slightly and glistens, providing an irregular organic look.\n- **Garnish**: Bright, fresh green (scallion/green onion), slightly shiny.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Bowl**: Centered in the image, circular, viewed from almost directly overhead, taking up about 90% of the image’s width, with the rim clearly visible. A slight drop shadow under the bowl indicates depth, but background is almost entirely white/off-white.\n- **Tofu Cubes**: Scattered densely across the surface, with many touching or slightly overlapping. Cubes are angled randomly rather than all aligned, creating a natural, scattered look. Most are within a central 70-80% radius of the bowl, leaving a thin visible saucy border at the edge.\n- **Sauce**: Fills the gaps and covers the bottom of the bowl, visible between tofu cubes and around the edge.\n- **Garnish**: The sliced green onion is positioned atop the tofu near the center, with pieces fanned slightly and angled.\n\n**4.

The closer jar’s lid has subtle markings or textures.\n- **Tomatoes:** Glossy, bright saturated red with droplets of water; smooth, spherical, shadowed undersides.\n- **Apples:**\n    - Dark red: deep burgundy with lighter speckling; surface is glossy with water droplets.\n    - Yellow-green: even hue, slightly translucent gloss; topped with a brown-green stem.\n    - Pinkish-red: peach-pink blend, transitioning from one color to another, with surface gloss.\n- **Leaves:** Bright yellow, detailed with prominent midribs and lateral veins, serrated edges, thin papery texture, some with brown speckling or edges.\n- **Background:** Weathered wooden surface (grayish-brown, planks), horizontally oriented and providing a rustic texture.\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning:**\n\n- **Foreground:**\n    - Clustered tomatoes cover the lower center (entire cluster occupies about 1/3 of bottom width).\n    - Yellow leaves are scattered, creating an arc from lower left to right and partially overlapping over tomatoes and jars.\n\n- **Central:**\n    - Two main jars are positioned slightly offset (left jar slightly in front of center jar), their bases aligned with the wooden surface.\n\n- **Background:**\n    - Jars and apples overlap vertically (apples behind jars). The blue-black container forms a dark, curved backdrop arching over the fruit/jar group.\n    - Apples: leftmost apple is behind the jars; the center apple (yellow-green) is in front; rightmost apple partly overlaps the red apple and yellow-green apple.\n    - The far-left jar protrudes slightly behind the foreground jars.\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic style.** All objects feature accurate proportions, shading, light reflections, and soft drop-shadows where they contact the table.\n- **No visible brushstrokes or stylization.** Textures (apple waxiness, tomato moisture, wood grain, and translucency of leaves) are rendered naturally.\n- **No outlines.** Edges are defined by color contrast, light, and shadow.\n\n**5. Any text, symbols, or specific details:**\n\n- **Lids:** Closest (left) jar lid has faint, possibly embossed/drawn seal designs (circular geometric/floral patterns) and what could be a small blue square sticker or seal, but no legible text.\n- **No visible labels** on jars.\n- **No typed, handwritten, or graphic text** elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric & Proportional Details for SVG:**\n\n- **Jars:** Foreground jars have rounded-rectangle bodies, topped with narrower ovals for threaded openings. Height:width ratio ≈ 1.4:1. Lids are golden ellipses, 90% width of jar body, 10% height of jar height. \n- **Tomatoes:** Spheres of nearly uniform diameter, arranged in a loosely connected cluster; each tomato ≈ 1/3 the width of a jar lid in diameter. Main stems: curving, with pointed sepals.\n- **Apples:** Spheres, slightly smaller than jars in width; stems emerge from shallow dimples, slightly off center.\n- **Leaves:** Ellipses with variably serrated edges, yellow fill, prominent dark green midveins, outlined by the contrast with the wooden background.\n- **Placement:** Main jars occupy left-center, apples and tomatoes spread out in a \"V\" to right and bottom. Wooden boards (background) run diagonally, lines converging rightward.\n  \n---\n\nThis comprehensive description should enable precise SVG-based recreation, maintaining accurate geometric arrangement, color, and detail.

  "v1_87": "Certainly! Here is a **detailed, precise description** of the image, consistent with your requirements for SVG recreation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- The image depicts a **bookshelf**, with **three visible wooden shelves**.\n- Each shelf contains a **row of books standing upright**, spines facing outward.\n- The books are primarily **rectangular cuboids** of various but *roughly similar* widths and heights.\n- No other main elements (no ornaments, objects, etc.)—just books and the shelves.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n### Colors\n\n- **Books:** The dominant colors on the spines are **dark tones**: black, navy blue, dark green, and maroon, with some lighter or more saturated tones: red, lighter blue, teal, forest green, yellow, and a multicolored (yellow/orange) book on the top shelf.\n- **Bookshelf:** The bookshelf is made of medium-brown wood with a consistent grain.\n- **Text:** Text on the spines is typically **gold, white, red, or black**—mostly serif typefaces, a few in sans-serif.\n- **Ribbons:** Several books feature **attached page marker ribbons** in white, red, yellow, or green, hanging visibly from the top (shelf 1) or bottom (shelf 2/3).\n\n### Textures and Surfaces\n\n- **Book covers** predominantly have a *smooth, semi-matte or semi-glossy* look, with a few appearing to be textured faux leather.\n- **Spines** sometimes include decorative stamped symbols (crosses, flourishes), lines, or embossing.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n### Books\n\n- **All books are upright and perpendicular to the shelves.**\n- **Some books are slightly tilted or misaligned** (not perfectly vertical), indicating casual placement.\n- **Book heights** within each row are *relatively even*, but not identical—tallest at the edges or scattered among shorter ones.\n- **Books are tightly packed**, little or no visible gap between most books.\n\n### Shelves\n\n- **Shelves are parallel, horizontal**, and comprise three visible rows.\n- **Shelves are slightly thicker than the books' spines** (perhaps 1.5x).\n- **Most books are flush with the shelf edge**, a few stick out 1–2 cm.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- The image is **photo-realistic**, not stylized—a straightforward frontal photo.\n- **No artistic exaggeration, abstraction, or distortion** of perspective; all lines parallel to the image edges.\n- The **intent is documentary/archival**, capturing a physical reality.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n### Text\n\n- Book spines display **book titles**, publisher names, and occasionally icons.\n- Many books prominently display the word **\"Biblia\", \"Bible\", \"Biblia Sacra\", \"Holy Bible\", or variants** (often at the top, bottom, or center of the spine).\n- Text **orientation is vertical/upright** (not rotated), but a few spines have text rotated 90° (reading from bottom to top).\n\n### Symbols and Details\n\n- Several books have **decorative crosses** on the spines (simple or ornate).\n- Some spines have **horizontal or vertical gold lines** or decorative filigree.\n- A few include **publisher or insignia symbols** at the bottom.\n- Several books have **integrated colored page marker ribbons**, visible as \"tails\" hanging from the tops (first two shelves) or bottoms (bottom shelf).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Geometric and Proportional Details\n\n- **Bookshelf total visible area:** nearly square (approx. 4:5 aspect ratio in photo).\n- **Shelves:** evenly spaced, about 2-2.5 book heights total, with a slight gap above most books.\n- **Number of books per shelf:** Varies (Shelf 1 ~19, Shelf 2 ~18, Shelf 3 ~17).\n- **Book width:** ranges from very thin (~1/20 shelf width) to thick volumes (~1/8 shelf width).\n- **Book height:** ranges from ~2/3 to ~4/5 of the shelf height.\n- **Spine decorations:** Typically bottom, center, or top; crosses or lines may be centered or aligned with text.\n- **Visible shelf thickness:** About 1/20 of shelf height.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Layout for SVG Creation\n\n- **Three parallel horizontal rectangles** (shelves), evenly distributed vertically.\n- **Between each shelf, a tightly packed sequence of rectangles** (books), each with:\n    - *Variable height* (but within a narrow range per row),\n    - *Variable width*,\n    - Solid color fill (matching color as described above),\n    - Vertical and/or horizontal white/gold/black text labels (title, minimal, mostly \"BIBLIA\"/\"BIBLE\"),\n    - Occasional thin vertical/horizontal lines (gold/white) as spine decorations,\n    - Simple geometric motifs (crosses, publisher icons, horizontal/vertical lines),\n    - Tiny rectangles (ribbons) emerging from top (shelf 1,2) or bottom (shelf 3) of books, colored red/white/yellow/green, width ~1/20 book width, length ~1/4 book height.\n- **No background visible except the wood between books.**\n- **Relative proportions:** Books are scaled consistently by shelf; shelf thickness is consistent and visible; books reach shelf tops or leave a small gap.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Noteworthy Variations\n\n- One book on the top shelf (towards right, orange/yellow) stands out—spine is a brightly colored abstract, whereas most are monotone.\n- Several books have distinct symbols/icons, notably crosses of varying designs.\n- Books are of different languages, evident from spine texts.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for SVG Reproduction:**  \nA front-facing, 3-shelf wooden bookcase, each shelf filled edge-to-edge with upright, rectangular books of varying height/width. Spines are colored (blues, greens, reds, blacks, browns, and some brights), decorated with gold/white text (“Bible”/“Biblia” variants), some with cross icons, lines, or publisher marks. Tightly packed, occasional page marker ribbons in red/white/yellow/green protrude from edges. Books are mostly uniform height per shelf; shelf and book proportions as above. No embellishments or background beside the shelf and book spines.\n\n---\n\nIf you need an **SVG pseudo-code or element breakdown** for a starter, let me know!",
  "v1_88": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive and precise SVG-oriented description of the image:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Central Object:** A car front, focusing on the center of the bumper and grille area.\n- **License Plate:** A rectangular license plate is the main focus, centrally mounted on the car’s front bumper.\n- **Text on Plate:** The text “S 3302 CD” is clearly printed in large bold font.\n- **Surrounding Elements:** The upper portion shows part of the car’s front grille (notably, a Volvo badge and diagonal line), while the lower edge of the bumper and the street surface are visible at the bottom.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

  "v1_95": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive description of the image, focusing on geometric and spatial details necessary for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- **Primary Object:** The central focus of the image is a *rectangular license plate*, oriented in landscape (horizontal) format.\n- **Background:** The license plate is attached to the *front grill of a vehicle*, with horizontal grill lines visible in the background.\n- **Interface:** The image is displayed inside a computer application's window, featuring a typical menu bar and toolbar at the top.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Color Palette:**  \n  - The image is in *grayscale* (black and white), with various tones of gray, black, and white.\n  - The application background is a light gray, while the image itself is in monochrome.\n- **Texture:**  \n  - The entire image (especially the license plate) is *significantly motion-blurred*, creating streaks diagonal from the top left to bottom right.\n  - The blur decreases sharpness and clarity, particularly for the text.\n- **Visual Quality:**  \n  - The scene is low-contrast due to the motion blur.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **License Plate:**  \n  - The license plate takes up about 75% of the image width and about 40% of the height.\n  - The plate is centered horizontally and slightly lower than vertical center.\n  - It appears fixed to a slightly slanted vertical surface (the front of a vehicle).\n  - The plate’s corners are slightly chamfered, but overall almost rectangular.\n- **Text/Characters:**  \n  - The main license plate text is horizontally centered on the plate and comprises large, bold, sans-serif characters.\n  - There is a dash (-) in the middle of the text group.\n  - Below the main text, there appears to be a smaller line of text, horizontally centered.\n- **Application Interface:**  \n  - The menu bar is at the very top (File, Edit, View, Insert, etc.)\n  - Toolbars with icons are directly below the menu bar.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Image Style:**  \n  - Realistic photo, but made abstract by the deliberate or accidental *motion blur*.\n- **Blurring Effects:**  \n  - Blur streaks run at a ~45-degree angle (upper left to lower right), spreading from the center outward.\n  - The level of blur causes all edges, numbers, and lines to \"spill\" in the blur direction.\n- **Application Window:**  \n  - The window and toolbars are drawn in basic, early-2000s/Windows classic GUI style.\n- **No artistic embellishments** beyond blur and grayscale.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n\n- **License Plate Text:**  \n  - The text reads: **A2D-632**, in two groups separated by a dash (\"-\").\n  - The numbers and letters are *large*, bold, and fill about 75% of the plate's width and 60% of its height.\n  - Below the main code is a second, much smaller text line, but it's almost unreadable due to blur (only presence is needed for SVG).\n  - In the top-left and top-right corners of the plate, there are faint, small marks (likely registration stickers or state marks).\n- **Other Details:**  \n  - No color on the plate due to grayscale; everything is shades of gray.\n  - Grille lines above and below the plate are horizontal, made of parallel bars filling the rectangle's width.\n\n---\n\n**SVG Layout/Construction Guidance:**\n\n- **Plate Rectangle:**  \n  - Centered in the SVG canvas, with 75% width and 40% height relative to the main viewport.\n  - Slightly rounded or chamfered corners.\n- **Main Text:**  \n  - Bold, sans-serif; centered. Letter group to the left, dash at center, number group to the right.\n  - Occupies central 75% width and upper 60% height of the plate.\n- **Secondary Text:**  \n  - Centered below, 1/5th the height of main text, runs horizontally but is blurred and unreadable.\n- **Corners:**  \n  - In each upper corner, a small circle or square to represent stickers.\n- **Blur:**  \n  - Apply a diagonal motion blur (SVG filter feGaussianBlur, or approximate with transparency streaks at 45-degree angle).\n- **Background:**  \n  - Horizontal grill bars, filling area above and below plate.\n- **Application Interface:**  \n  - A rectangular window with a gray title bar and menu/toolbars at top 10% of the canvas, typical of Windows Classic GUI.\n  - Menu bar with placeholder menu names (\"File\", \"Edit\", \"View\", etc.).\n  - Toolbar below with various document and editor icons.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Element                | Shape & Proportion                                    | Color                 | Position                          |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| License plate          | Horiz. rectangle, 75% w, 40% h, rounded corners       | Medium-light gray     | Centered, slightly low            |\n| Main text (A2D-632)    | Bold sans-serif, huge                                 | Black/very dark gray | Center of plate                   |\n| Subtext                | Small, blurry line                                    | Gray                  | Centered below main text on plate |\n| Corner marks           | Small circles/squares                                 | Dark gray             | Plate corners                     |\n| Vehicle grill          | Horizontal bars (rectangles)                          | Dark gray             | Above/below license plate         |\n| Blur                   | 45° motion blur, whole image                          | N/A                   | N/A                               |\n| Application menu/tools | Rect. bar, rows of icons                              | Light gray            | Top 10% of canvas                 |\n\n---\n\n**To Recreate in SVG:**\n- Begin with a light gray background for the interface.\n- Add an outer rectangle for the app window.\n- Draw a centered horizontal rectangle for the license plate with rounded corners and a gradient or solid medium gray.\n- Overlay horizontally centered, bold, sans-serif text “A2D-632” (bold, upper-case letters, dash is centered).\n- Below main text, add a thin, unreadable text line.\n- Add small circle/square shapes in the plate’s upper corners.\n- (Behind plate) Draw horizontal bars for car grille.\n- Overlay everything with a diagonal blur or semi-transparent blur stripes at 45°.\n- Add a top strip with \"File Edit View...\" menus and simple icon buttons below.\n\n---\n\nIf you need explicit SVG code or further geometric breakdown, please specify.",

  "v1_98": "Certainly! Here’s a comprehensive and detailed description of the image for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- The image consists of a simplified, **flat map of the world** (Robinson or Mercator projection style).\n- **Continents** and large **islands** are depicted as filled solid shapes (no country borders or internal divisions; except Asia, which is distinguished by a different color).\n- **No ocean or latitude/longitude lines** appear, just the silhouette of land masses.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Landmasses:** \n    - **Asia:** Entire continent is filled with solid, **bright red** (#FF0000 or similar).\n    - **Other continents and islands:** Filled with solid **white** (#FFFFFF).\n    - All land masses have a thin **black outline**.\n- **Oceans/Background:** The area surrounding the continents (representing oceans) is filled with a neutral **medium gray** (#606060 or similar; not pure black or white, but a uniform shade).\n- **No gradients, patterns, or texture effects**—all fills are flat colors.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- The map is **centered horizontally and vertically** within the image, taking up about **85–90% of the width and ~60–70% of the height**.\n- **Map projection**: Standard rectangular projection. Latitude is compressed near the poles, giving Greenland and Antarctica a broad appearance, typical of most world map views.\n- **Asia’s shape**:\n    - The red fill covers the entire landmass traditionally considered Asia—starting west with the Ural Mountains dividing line, to the eastern edges of Russia and islands in Southeast Asia up to Indonesia, the Indian subcontinent to the south, the entirety of the Middle East up to Egypt’s Sinai.\n    - Border exceptions (approximate): Turkey’s Asian part is included; eastern Russia is included; the border between Asia/Europe in Kazakhstan and Russia follows traditional geopolitical interpretations.\n    - Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia (beyond the western islands) are colored red to the extent they are geopolitically Asian.\n- Other continents/islands (Africa, Europe, North and South America, Australia, Antarctica, Greenland, and non-Asian islands) are all **white**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalistic, modern flat design.**\n- No shadows, no 3D or beveled effects.\n- Outlines: All landmasses (including Asia) have equal **thin black borders** (0.5–1.5 px suggested at SVG scale).\n- No surrounding border/frame around the map or ocean.\n- No labels, marks, or additional graphical flourishes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- **No text** of any kind is present in the image.\n- **No flags, icons, or additional symbols.**\n- **No country borders** within continents—Asia is not divided into countries; it is a contiguous filled region.\n\n---\n\n### **Geometric Details and Proportions**\n- **Aspect Ratio:** Roughly 16:9 (the image appears slightly wider than tall).\n- **Asia’s coverage:** The northernmost edge nearly reaches the top edge of the landmass area, and the eastern edge (Kamchatka, Japan) nears the far-right of the map.\n- **Map Placement:** The map leaves a buffer (approx. 5–10% of image height and width) from all edges.\n- **Proportions:** Standard world map proportions (Europe is smaller than North America; Africa is central; Americas are to left; Australia is at lower right).\n\n---\n\n### **SVG Structure Summary**\n- **Background rect:** medium gray (#606060).\n- **Landmass paths:** white fill, black stroke.\n- **Asia path:** red fill (#FF0000), black stroke, overlays the white world path in the Asian region.\n- **Path order:** gray background → white landmass → red Asia overlay.\n\n---\n\n**This precise and comprehensive description should allow for recreation of the image as an SVG, with correct geometric positioning, coloring, and layering.**",

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Color palette:** Bright, high-contrast, mostly solid fills with some shading for depth.\n  - Blue whale: Deep blue back, lighter blue underbelly.\n  - Killer whale: Black with prominent white patches.\n  - Fish: Bright blue, darker dorsal side, yellow eye.\n  - Krill: Red-orange, white accents.\n  - Seaweed: Three shades of solid green for depth.\n  - Crab: Orange-red body and pincers.\n- **Textures:** Indicated by subtle line patterns (e.g., fish scales, krill segments), but generally smooth and solid-colored.\n- **Visual properties:** Bold, dark outlines around each organism.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Layout:**\n  - **Top left:** Blue whale (largest), seagull below to the right, arrows point between them.\n  - **Top right:** Killer whale (second largest), left of it is the elephant seal sitting.\n  - **Center:** Dominated by leopard seal. To its left, fish and krill. Penguin is to its lower right, squid to the right of penguin, crab below squid.\n  - **Bottom left:** Phytoplankton cluster, zooplankton below left. Seaweed far bottom right of center.\n- **Proportions:**\n  - Blue whale and killer whale: Largest objects. Leopard seal, elephant seal, and penguin: mid-size.\n  - Fish, squid, krill, crab: smaller, but each distinct.\n  - Zooplankton/phytoplankton: smallest, clustered.\n  - Seaweed: tall, but thinner and bottom-rooted.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Cartoon/naturalist hybrid:** Playful but with anatomical correctness.\n- **Bold outlines:** All objects have uniform dark outlines for clarity.\n- **Flat coloring:** Shading is minimal—used less for realism, more for dimension.\n- **Simple but expressive faces:** Eyes, mouths, and flippers/wings are stylized for clarity.\n- **Arrows:** Consistent thickness, black, sometimes curved, occasionally straight (always with pointed heads indicating predation).\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Labels:** Each organism is labeled with clear, sans-serif black text, horizontally aligned next to or above each animal. Placement minimizes overlap with the illustration.\n  - Example: “Blue whale” above/left of the whale, “Krill” above krill etc.\n- **No background:** White or transparent canvas, no additional scenery.\n- **Distinct grouping:** Phytoplankton and zooplankton are clustered for clarity, phytoplankton with several classic microalgae shapes (circle, triangle, zig-zag, spindle).\n\n---\n\n**6. Geometric Layout for SVG:**\n- **Canvas suggestion:** Rectangular (landscape), approx. 4:3 ratio.\n- **Relative Size Suggestions (biggest to smallest):**\n  - Blue whale: ~2x the length of killer whale.\n  - Killer whale: ~1.75x that of leopard seal.\n  - Elephant seal: about the same “height” as killer whale but bulkier.\n  - Others decrease in relative size accordingly, with phytoplankton/zooplankton each ~1/8th diameter of blue whale.\n- **Arrow paths:** Use quadratic bezier curves for bends, ensure clear, non-overlapping routes. Where crossing unavoidable, arrows are stacked with gaps.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table (for easy reference):**\n\n| Object          | Shape/Orientation/Color                | Position       | Relative Size | Features                    |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| Blue whale      | Streamlined, curved, blue             | Top left      | Largest      | Lighter belly, tail fin     |\n| Seagull         | Bird, wings folded, gray/white        | Under whale   | Small        | Orange beak                 |\n| Leopard seal    | Torpedo, gray-blue, jaw open          | Center        | Medium       | Dark spots                  |\n| Fish            | Classic fish, blue, open mouth        | Left of krill | Small        | Fins detailed               |\n| Krill           | Segmented, red-orange                 | Left of seaweed| Small       | Multiple legs/antennae      |\n| Zooplankton     | Tiny, cluster, orange/tan             | Bottom left   | Smallest     | Multi-shaped                |\n| Phytoplankton   | Tiny, green shapes, clustered         | Left center   | Smallest     | 4+ geometric forms          |\n| Seaweed         | Curved, green, 3 stalks               | Bottom center | Narrow/Tall  | Wavy arms, rooted base      |\n| Crab            | Red-orange, pincers raised            | Bottom right  | Med-small    | Symmetric claws             |\n| Squid           | Elongated, blue, ropey tentacles      | Mid-right     | Small        | Fins, spot eye              |\n| Penguin         | Upright, black/white, orange feet     | Right of seal | Med-small    | Wings/flippers at sides     |\n| Elephant seal   | Brown, sitting, trunk nose            | Right         | Large, squat | Flippers ground             |\n| Killer whale    | Streamlined, black/white, large fin   | Top right     | 2nd largest  | White face patch            |\n\n---\n\nIf you need this as a code schema for an SVG, let me know!"
