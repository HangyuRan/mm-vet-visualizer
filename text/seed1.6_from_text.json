  "v1_0": "To accurately recreate this hand-drawn algebraic equation as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description of its elements, properties, and layout:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a playful, hand-drawn algebraic equation: **(x + 3)² = 4**. All elements are mathematical symbols rendered as wobbly, thick-lined outlines. From left to right, the sequence is:  \n- **Left Parenthesis**: A large, curved opening parenthesis `(` enclosing the left side of the equation.  \n- **Variable \"x\"**: A crossed symbol (two diagonal lines) representing the variable.  \n- **Plus Sign**: A `+` composed of a horizontal and vertical line crossing at the center.  \n- **Number \"3\"**: A two-looped digit (top loop smaller than the bottom loop).  \n- **Right Parenthesis**: A large, curved closing parenthesis `)` enclosing the left side of the equation.  \n- **Exponent \"2\"**: A superscript `²` positioned above and to the right of the right parenthesis.  \n- **Equals Sign**: Two horizontal lines `=` stacked vertically.  \n- **Number \"4\"**: A digit with a vertical stem, a horizontal top bar, and a curved \"tail\" connecting the two.  \n\nAll elements are **outlines** (no fills) with rounded ends, suggesting a marker or crayon.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Color**: All elements are filled with a bright, saturated green (#2ecc71). The background is plain white (no texture).  \n- **Stroke Width**:  \n  - Main elements (parentheses, x, +, 3, =, 4): **5px** (thick, childlike lines).  \n  - Exponent \"2\": **3px** (smaller, as a superscript).  \n- **Line Properties**:  \n  - **Stroke-linecap**: Round (rounded ends for all lines, consistent with marker use).  \n  - **Stroke-linejoin**: Round (rounded corners where lines intersect, e.g., the \"x\" or \"+\").  \n- **Texture**: All lines are **wobbly and irregular** (not perfectly straight or symmetrical), giving a playful, hand-drawn feel. No two lines are identical in curvature.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe equation is centered **horizontally** and **vertically** in a hypothetical 600px × 200px canvas (adjustable based on scale). Elements are arranged left-to-right in the order of the algebraic expression:  \n- **Left Parenthesis**: Starts at the bottom-left of the canvas, curves upward to enclose the \"x\", \"+\", and \"3\". It spans ~100px tall (from y=30 to y=170) and ~40px wide (from x=50 to x=90).  \n- **Variable \"x\"**: Inside the left parenthesis, centered at (120, 100). The two diagonal lines cross at the center, with the left line extending from (100, 60) to (140, 140) and the right line from (100, 140) to (140, 60).  \n- **Plus Sign**: To the right of the \"x\", centered at (200, 100). The horizontal line spans (180, 100) to (220, 100); the vertical line spans (200, 80) to (200, 120).  \n- **Number \"3\"**: To the right of the \"+\", centered at (300, 100). The top loop spans (280, 60) to (300, 100); the bottom loop spans (300, 100) to (320, 140).  \n- **Right Parenthesis**: To the right of the \"3\", mirroring the left parenthesis. It spans ~100px tall (y=30 to y=170) and ~40px wide (x=360 to x=400).  \n- **Exponent \"2\"**: Superscript, positioned **above and to the right** of the right parenthesis. Centered at (450, 50) (y=50 is above the main elements’ center at y=100). It is ~50% smaller than the main elements (stroke width 3px).  \n- **Equals Sign**: To the right of the exponent, centered at (500, 100). Two horizontal lines: top line (480, 90) to (520, 90); bottom line (480, 110) to (520, 110). Spaced ~10px apart vertically.  \n- **Number \"4\"**: To the right of the equals sign, centered at (580, 100). The vertical stem spans (580, 30) to (580, 170); the horizontal top bar spans (540, 30) to (580, 30); the curved tail connects (540, 30) to (580, 140).  \n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Style**: Informal, childlike, and playful. The wobbly lines and irregular shapes suggest a hand-drawn sketch with a marker or crayon.  \n- **Key Artistic Traits**:  \n  - **Imperfection**: No element is perfectly symmetrical or straight (e.g., the \"x\" has uneven diagonal lines; the \"3\" has lopsided loops).  \n  - **Superscript Treatment**: The exponent \"2\" is smaller and positioned above the right parenthesis, a standard mathematical notation.  \n  - **Thick Lines**: The heavy stroke width gives the image a bold, eye-catching appearance.  \n- **Mood**: Lighthearted and approachable, lacking the formality of printed math symbols.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text/Symbols**: All elements are mathematical symbols:  \n  - Variables: `x`  \n  - Operators: `+` (addition), `=` (equality)  \n  - Numbers: `3`, `4`  \n  - Punctuation: `(` (opening parenthesis), `)` (closing parenthesis)  \n  - Exponent: `²` (squaring)  \n- **Critical Details for SVG**:  \n  - **Exponent Positioning**: The \"2\" must be a **superscript** (smaller, above the right parenthesis).  \n  - **Equals Sign**: Two horizontal lines (not one), spaced vertically.  \n  - **\"x\" Structure**: Two crossing diagonal lines (not a single line or \"×\" symbol).  \n  - **\"4\" Structure**: A closed loop (the curved tail connects to the vertical stem, forming a complete shape).  \n  - **Parentheses**: Large enough to enclose the \"x\", \"+\", and \"3\" (no overlap with external elements).  \n  - **Line Continuity**: All lines are continuous (no breaks); e.g., the \"3\" is a single looped line, and the parentheses are unbroken curves.  \n\n\n### **SVG Technical Specifications**\nTo recreate the image accurately, use the following SVG attributes:  \n- **Canvas**: Set a width (e.g., 600px) and height (e.g., 200px) to accommodate the horizontal layout.  \n- **Stroke Properties**:  \n  - `stroke: #2ecc71` (bright green)  \n  - `stroke-width: 5px` (main elements), `3px` (exponent)  \n  - `stroke-linecap: round`  \n  - `stroke-linejoin: round`  \n  - `fill: none` (all elements are outlines)  \n- **Element Paths**: Use `path` elements for curved shapes (parentheses, \"3\", \"4\", \"2\") and `line` elements for straight lines ( \"+\", \"x\" crossbars, equals sign). For example:  \n  - **Left Parenthesis**: A quadratic curve opening to the right:  \n    `<path d=\"M 50 170 Q 30 100 50 30 Q 70 100 50 170\" stroke=\"#2ecc71\" stroke-width=\"5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" fill=\"none\"/>`  \n  - **Exponent \"2\"**: A smaller, looped path above the right parenthesis:  \n    `<path d=\"M 450 40 Q 430 60 450 80 Q 470 60 450 40\" stroke=\"#2ecc71\" stroke-width=\"3\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" fill=\"none\"/>`  \n  - **Equals Sign**: Two horizontal lines:  \n    `<line x1=\"480\" y1=\"90\" x2=\"520\" y2=\"90\" stroke=\"#2ecc71\" stroke-width=\"5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"/>`  \n    `<line x1=\"480\" y1=\"110\" x2=\"520\" y2=\"110\" stroke=\"#2ecc71\" stroke-width=\"5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"/>`  \n\n- **Positioning**: Use `transform` attributes to adjust element placement (e.g., `transform=\"translate(450, 50)\"` for the exponent).  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key Dimensions (Approximate)**\n| Element       | Width (px) | Height (px) | Stroke Width (px) | Position (x, y Center) |\n|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Left Parenthesis | 40         | 140         | 5                 | (70, 100)              |\n| \"x\"           | 40         | 80          | 5                 | (120, 100)             |\n| \"+\"           | 40         | 40          | 5                 | (200, 100)             |\n| \"3\"           | 40         | 80          | 5                 | (300, 100)             |\n| Right Parenthesis | 40         | 140         | 5                 | (380, 100)             |\n| \"²\" (Exponent) | 20         | 40          | 3                 | (450, 50)              |\n| \"=\"           | 40         | 20          | 5                 | (500, 100)             |\n| \"4\"           | 40         | 140         | 5                 | (580, 100)             |\n\n\nThis description provides all the geometric, stylistic, and positional information needed to recreate the hand-drawn equation as an accurate SVG. The focus on imperfection (wobbly lines, irregular shapes) and mathematical notation (superscript, equals sign structure) is critical to matching the original image’s character.",

Below is a breakdown of each element:  \n\n---\n\n#### **Title**  \n- **Content**: `Solve the following equations:`  \n- **Format**:  \n  - Ends with a colon (`:`) to indicate a list of equations follows.  \n  - **SVG Code**:  \n    ```svg\n    <text x=\"20\" y=\"40\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"24\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\">\n      Solve the following equations:\n    </text>\n    ```\n\n---\n\n#### **First Equation (1)**  \n- **Content**: `1) 8x + 11 = 4x + 14`  \n- **Formatting Rules**:  \n  - **Numbering**: \"1)\" (closing parenthesis after the number, followed by a space).  \n  - **Variables**: `x` is italicized.  \n  - **Spacing**:  \n    - No space between coefficients and variables (e.g., `8x`, not `8 x`).  \n    - Space before/after binary operators (`+`, `=`) (e.g., `8x + 11`, not `8x+11`).  \n  - **Operators**: Plus (`+`) and equals (`=`) use standard Unicode characters.  \n- **SVG Code** (with `<tspan>` for italic variables):  \n  ```svg\n  <text x=\"20\" y=\"80\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"18\" fill=\"#000000\">\n    <tspan>1) </tspan>\n    <tspan>8</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">x</tspan>\n    <tspan> + 11 = </tspan>\n    <tspan>4</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">x</tspan>\n    <tspan> + 14</tspan>\n  </text>\n  ```\n\n---\n\n#### **Second Equation (2)**  \n- **Content**: `2) 7d − 4 = 11d − 9`  \n- **Formatting Rules**:  \n  - **Numbering**: \"2)\" (consistent with the first equation).  \n  - **Variables**: `d` is italicized.  \n  - **Spacing**: Same as the first equation (e.g., `7d − 4`, not `7d-4`).  \n  - **Operators**: Minus (`−`) uses the **mathematical minus sign** (Unicode `U+2212`), not a hyphen (`-`).  \n- **SVG Code** (with `<tspan>` for italic variables and correct minus signs):  \n  ```svg\n  <text x=\"20\" y=\"120\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"18\" fill=\"#000000\">\n    <tspan>2) </tspan>\n    <tspan>7</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">d</tspan>\n    <tspan> − 4 = </tspan>\n    <tspan>11</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">d</tspan>\n    <tspan> − 9</tspan>\n  </text>\n  ```\n\n---\n\n\n### **6. Spatial Layout Summary (SVG ViewBox: `0 0 600 200`)**\nThe viewBox defines the coordinate system, ensuring the SVG scales proportionally. Key positions:  \n\n| Element               | X (Left) | Y (Baseline) | Width Estimate (Arial 18px) |\n|-----------------------|----------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| Title                 | 20px     | 40px         | ~264px                      |\n| First Equation        | 20px     | 80px         | ~126px                      |\n| Second Equation       | 20px     | 120px        | ~117px                      |\n\n#### **Critical Spacing Checks**  \n- **Title to Equation 1**: 40px (baseline-to-baseline) ensures the instruction is distinct from the problems.  \n- **Equation 1 to Equation 2**: 40px (baseline-to-baseline) prevents overcrowding.  \n- **Left Margin**: 20px (consistent for all elements) maintains a clean layout.  \n\n\n### **7. Final SVG Code (Complete)**\nThis code integrates all the above details and will accurately reproduce the image:  \n\n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 600 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- White Background -->\n  <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#ffffff\" />\n  \n  <!-- Title: Instruction -->\n  <text x=\"20\" y=\"40\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"24\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\">\n    Solve the following equations:\n  </text>\n  \n  <!-- First Equation (1) -->\n  <text x=\"20\" y=\"80\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"18\" fill=\"#000000\">\n    <tspan>1) </tspan>\n    <tspan>8</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">x</tspan>\n    <tspan> + 11 = </tspan>\n    <tspan>4</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">x</tspan>\n    <tspan> + 14</tspan>\n  </text>\n  \n  <!-- Second Equation (2) -->\n  <text x=\"20\" y=\"120\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"18\" fill=\"#000000\">\n    <tspan>2) </tspan>\n    <tspan>7</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">d</tspan>\n    <tspan> − 4 = </tspan>\n    <tspan>11</tspan>\n    <tspan font-style=\"italic\">d</tspan>\n    <tspan> − 9</tspan>\n  </text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **8. Validation and Testing Notes**\nTo ensure accuracy, verify the SVG in a browser or viewer for:  \n- **Variable Italics**: `x` and `d` must be italicized.  \n- **Minus Signs**: Use `−` (U+2212) instead of `-` (U+002D) (check in the second equation).  \n- **Spacing**: Consistent spaces around operators (`+`, `−`, `=`) (e.g., `8x + 11`, not `8x+11`).  \n- **Positioning**: All elements must be left-aligned with the specified margins.  \n\nThis SVG adheres to **mathematical typesetting conventions** and **educational design principles**, making it suitable for reproduction in textbooks, worksheets, or digital learning materials.",
  "v1_100": "To accurately recreate this scientific diagram as an SVG, the following detailed description covers all critical elements—geometric shapes, colors, spatial layout, text, and style—with precise measurements and specifications.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of **two identical closed rigid containers** (jars) labeled *Sample A* (left) and *Sample B* (right). Each jar holds **8 gas particles** (colored circles) with motion indicators (curved lines). Key elements include:\n\n#### **Jars**\nEach jar is a closed container with:\n- **Lid**: A flat, rectangular strip covering the top of the jar.\n- **Body**: A vertical cylinder with a **rounded bottom** (semicircular base) and a flat top.\n- **Outline**: Thin gray border defining the jar’s shape.\n\n#### **Particles**\n- **Sample A**: 8 solid green circles (representing gas particles).\n- **Sample B**: 8 solid blue circles (representing gas particles).\n- **Motion Indicators**: Three curved \"motion lines\" (arcs) behind each particle, indicating direction of movement.\n\n#### **Text**\n- **Header Paragraph**: Explanatory text above the jars.\n- **Labels**: \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" below each jar.\n- **Data**: Two lines of quantitative data (mass, average speed) below each label.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **flat colors** (no gradients or shadows) for a minimalist, scientific style. Specified hex codes ensure consistency:\n\n| Element               | Color (Hex)       | Description                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Jar Lid               | `#808080`         | Medium gray, solid fill.                     |\n| Jar Body Outline      | `#D3D3D3`         | Light gray, thin border (0.005 units thick). |\n| Jar Body Fill         | `#FFFFFF`         | White, smooth fill.                          |\n| Sample A Particles    | `#27AE60`         | Dark green, solid circular fill.             |\n| Sample B Particles    | `#3498DB`         | Medium blue, solid circular fill.            |\n| Motion Lines          | `#A9A9A9`         | Dark gray, thin lines (0.005 units thick).   |\n| Text (All)            | `#000000`         | Black, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial).        |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **symmetrical** with consistent spacing. All measurements are relative to a **jar diameter of 1 unit** (for scalability). Key positions:\n\n#### **Jars**\n- **Centering**: Both jars are vertically centered on the page (center at `y = 0.75` units from the bottom).\n- **Spacing**: Jars are side-by-side, with their centers separated by **2.5 units** (1 unit = jar diameter). The left jar’s center is at `x = 1.25` units; the right jar’s center is at `x = 3.75` units.\n- **Dimensions**:\n  - **Total Height**: 1.5 units (lid + body).\n  - **Lid**: Width = 1 unit (matches jar diameter), height = 0.15 units (10% of total height).\n  - **Body**: Height = 1.35 units (total height - lid height), diameter = 1 unit.\n  - **Rounded Bottom**: Semicircular base with radius = 0.5 units (half the jar diameter).\n\n#### **Particles**\n- **Distribution**: Randomly spread within the jar’s body (no overlap). Example coordinates for Sample A (relative to the jar’s center, `(0,0)`):\n  - `(-0.3, 0.4)`, `(-0.1, 0.2)`, `(0.2, 0.1)`, `(-0.2, -0.1)`, `(0.1, -0.2)`, `(-0.3, -0.3)`, `(0.3, -0.4)`, `(0.0, 0.0)`.\n- **Size**: Diameter = 0.1 units (10% of jar diameter), radius = 0.05 units.\n\n#### **Motion Lines**\n- **Orientation**: Three arcs **behind** each particle (opposite the direction of movement). For a particle moving right, arcs are to the left; for a particle moving up, arcs are below.\n- **Dimensions**:\n  - **Radii**: 0.06 units (largest), 0.05 units (middle), 0.04 units (smallest).\n  - **Spacing**: Arcs are equidistant (0.01 units between centers).\n  - **Length**: 90° (quarter-circle) to indicate continuous motion.\n- **Example**: A particle at `(-0.3, 0.4)` (Sample A) moving right has arcs centered at:\n  - `(-0.36, 0.4)` (radius 0.06), `(-0.35, 0.4)` (radius 0.05), `(-0.34, 0.4)` (radius 0.04).\n\n#### **Text**\n- **Header Paragraph**: Left-aligned, with a **0.5 unit margin** from the left edge of the page. Positioned at `y = 0.2` units (above the jars).\n- **Labels**: \"Sample A\" and \"Sample B\" are **centered** below their respective jars. Positioned at `y = 1.6` units (below the jar’s bottom).\n- **Data**: Two lines of text below each label, **centered** with:\n  - **Line 1**: \"Mass of each particle: X u\" (positioned at `y = 1.65` units).\n  - **Line 2**: \"Average particle speed: X m/s\" (positioned at `y = 1.69` units).\n- **Spacing**:\n  - 0.02 units between the label and the first data line.\n  - 0.02 units between the two data lines.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe diagram follows a **minimalist, scientific style** with:\n- **Flat Colors**: No gradients or shadows (focus on clarity).\n- **Simple Shapes**: Circles (particles), rectangles (lids), cylinders (jars) for easy reproduction.\n- **Motion Indication**: Curved arcs (standard in physics diagrams) to show particle movement.\n- **Symmetry**: Identical jars and layout to emphasize comparison between samples.\n- **Hierarchy**: Jars are the focal point; text is secondary (smaller font size, lighter color).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text uses a **sans-serif font** (e.g., Arial) for readability. Key text elements:\n\n#### **Header Paragraph**\n- **Content**:  \n  *\"The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.\"*  \n- **Format**: Left-aligned, three lines, font size = 0.05 units (5% of jar height).\n- **Position**: `x = 0.5` units (left margin), `y = 0.2` units (above the jars).\n\n#### **Labels**\n- **Sample A**: \"Sample A\" (bold, centered, font size = 0.06 units).\n- **Sample B**: \"Sample B\" (bold, centered, font size = 0.06 units).\n- **Position**: Centered below each jar (`x = 1.25` for Sample A, `x = 3.75` for Sample B).\n\n#### **Data**\n- **Sample A**:  \n  - *\"Mass of each particle: 44 u\"* (regular, centered, font size = 0.04 units).  \n  - *\"Average particle speed: 830 m/s\"* (regular, centered, font size = 0.04 units).  \n- **Sample B**:  \n  - *\"Mass of each particle: 36 u\"* (regular, centered, font size = 0.04 units).  \n  - *\"Average particle speed: 690 m/s\"* (regular, centered, font size = 0.04 units).  \n- **Units**: \"u\" (atomic mass units) and \"m/s\" (meters per second) are included for clarity.\n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo reproduce the image accurately, use the following SVG elements and attributes:\n\n#### **Jar Lid**\n```svg\n<rect x=\"0.75\" y=\"1.35\" width=\"1\" height=\"0.15\" fill=\"#808080\" />\n<!-- Centered on the jar: x = jar center (1.25) - 0.5 (half lid width) = 0.75 -->\n```\n\n#### **Jar Body**\n```svg\n<path d=\"M1.25,1.35 A0.5,0.5 0 0 1 1.75,1.35 L1.75,0.5 A0.5,0.5 0 0 0 1.25,0.5 Z\" \n      stroke=\"#D3D3D3\" stroke-width=\"0.005\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" />\n<!-- Explanation: \n     - M1.25,1.35: Start at the jar's top center.\n     - A0.5,0.5 0 0 1 1.75,1.35: Draw a 180° arc (top half of the jar) to the right edge.\n     - L1.75,0.5: Line to the bottom right edge.\n     - A0.5,0.5 0 0 0 1.25,0.5: Draw a 180° arc (bottom half of the jar) to the center.\n     - Z: Close the path.\n-->\n```\n\n#### **Particle (Sample A)**\n```svg\n<circle cx=\"1.25\" cy=\"0.75\" r=\"0.05\" fill=\"#27AE60\" />\n<!-- Centered in the jar: cx = jar center (1.25), cy = jar center (0.75) -->\n```\n\n#### **Motion Lines (Sample A Particle Moving Right)**\n```svg\n<!-- Largest arc (radius 0.06 units) -->\n<path d=\"M1.25 - 0.06, 0.75 A0.06,0.06 0 0 1 1.25 - 0.06, 0.75 + 0.06\" \n      stroke=\"#A9A9A9\" stroke-width=\"0.005\" fill=\"none\" />\n<!-- Middle arc (radius 0.05 units) -->\n<path d=\"M1.25 - 0.05, 0.75 A0.05,0.05 0 0 1 1.25 - 0.05, 0.75 + 0.05\" \n      stroke=\"#A9A9A9\" stroke-width=\"0.005\" fill=\"none\" />\n<!-- Smallest arc (radius 0.04 units) -->\n<path d=\"M1.25 - 0.04, 0.75 A0.04,0.04 0 0 1 1.25 - 0.04, 0.75 + 0.04\" \n      stroke=\"#A9A9A9\" stroke-width=\"0.005\" fill=\"none\" />\n<!-- Explanation: Arcs are drawn to the left of the particle (opposite direction of movement) with centers at (cx - radius, cy) -->\n```\n\n#### **Text (Sample A Label)**\n```svg\n<text x=\"1.25\" y=\"1.6\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"0.06\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">\n  Sample A\n</text>\n<!-- Centered below the jar: x = jar center (1.25), y = 1.6 units (below the jar's bottom) -->\n```\n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\nTo build the SVG:\n1. **Draw the jars** (lid + body) using rectangles and paths.\n2. **Add particles** (circles) with random positions within each jar.\n3. **Add motion lines** (arcs) behind each particle, oriented to indicate movement.\n4. **Insert text** (header, labels, data) using the specified fonts and positions.\n5. **Apply colors** and adjust dimensions to match the relative units (scalable).\n\nThis detailed description ensures accurate reproduction of the diagram, with all geometric, spatial, and stylistic elements clearly defined for SVG creation.",
  "v1_101": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its components, layout, and visual properties. The image is a **minimalist, flat-design map of the United States** highlighting specific states and cities, with a focus on clarity and geometric precision.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe primary subject is a **simplified map of the United States**, including the **contiguous 48 states**, **Alaska**, and **Hawaii**. Key elements are:  \n- **States**: 48 contiguous states (outlined in gray), plus Alaska (large, irregular polygon) and Hawaii (4 small islands).  \n- **Highlighted States**: 5 states filled with light green:  \n  - California (leftmost contiguous state)  \n  - Colorado (central contiguous state)  \n  - Minnesota (upper Midwest)  \n  - Iowa (south of Minnesota)  \n  - Pennsylvania (Northeast)  \n- **City Markers**: 3 small green circles representing:  \n  - Chicago (Illinois)  \n  - Atlanta (Georgia)  \n  - Orlando (Florida)  \n- **Text Labels**: State names (large, black) and city names (smaller, black) in sans-serif font.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **flat colors** (no gradients, shadows, or textures) for a modern, clean aesthetic:  \n- **Background**: Solid white (#FFFFFF).  \n- **State Outlines**: Thin (0.5pt/1px) light gray stroke (#E0E0E0) for all states (contiguous, Alaska, Hawaii).  \n- **Highlighted States/City Markers**: Uniform light green fill (#AED581) — same color for both states and circles.  \n- **Text**: Solid black (#000000), sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for all labels.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout prioritizes clarity and geographic accuracy (simplified for readability):  \n- **Contiguous US**: Centered horizontally,占据 80% of the image width (x=100–900 in a 1000px viewBox) and 90% of the height (y=50–550).  \n- **Alaska**: Positioned **left of the contiguous US**, bottom-aligned with the contiguous US’s southern border (e.g., Texas’s bottom). Its southern tip aligns with the contiguous US’s bottom edge.  \n- **Hawaii**: 4 small islands **right of Alaska**, below the contiguous US. The northernmost island aligns with the contiguous US’s southern border (Florida’s bottom).  \n\n#### **Highlighted States**  \n| State         | Position in Contiguous US       | Borders (Simplified)                |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| California    | Leftmost, spans top-to-bottom    | Curved south (Mexico), straight north (Oregon), straight east (Nevada) |\n| Colorado      | Middle, slightly above center    | Perfect rectangle (straight all sides) |\n| Minnesota     | Upper Midwest, north of Iowa     | Rectangle with curved east (Lake Superior) |\n| Iowa          | Middle, south of Minnesota       | Perfect rectangle (straight all sides) |\n| Pennsylvania  | Northeast, east of Ohio          | Irregular (straight west, curved east “tail”) |\n\n#### **City Markers**  \n| City      | State       | Position Relative to Contiguous US |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Chicago   | Illinois    | Middle third, right of center (east of Iowa) |\n| Atlanta   | Georgia     | Lower right third (north of Florida) |\n| Orlando   | Florida     | Lower right corner (eastern coast)  |\n\n#### **Text Positioning**  \n- **State Names**: Centered within their highlighted state (e.g., “CALIFORNIA” in California’s top half, “COLORADO” in Colorado’s center).  \n- **City Names**:  \n  - “SAN DIEGO”: Bottom half of California (inside the green fill).  \n  - “CHICAGO”, “ATLANTA”, “ORLANDO”: To the **right** of their respective green circles (text-anchor=start for left alignment).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalist/Flat Design**: No 3D effects, gradients, or textures — focus on geometric simplicity.  \n- **Consistency**: Uniform stroke width (0.5pt) for all state outlines, same green color for highlighted states/cities, and consistent font (sans-serif) for text.  \n- **Simplification**: States are reduced to basic polygons (e.g., Colorado as a perfect rectangle) for readability, while retaining recognizable geographic shapes (e.g., California’s curved south border).  \n\n\n### **5.

  "v1_102": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into vectorizable elements, focusing on geometry, color, spatial relationships, and stylistic cues. The image depicts a post-collapse rescue operation in an urban area, with a chaotic rubble pile as the focal point, surrounded by emergency workers, onlookers, and damaged infrastructure.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is dominated by a **large, irregular rubble pile** (foreground-middle ground) composed of:  \n- **Concrete debris**: Chunks of varying sizes (rectangular, triangular, irregular polygons) with chipped edges and exposed rebar.  \n- **Standing concrete pillars**: 4–6 rectangular prisms (1.5–3m tall, 0.5m x 0.5m cross-section) with tapered tops, scattered across the rubble.  \n- **Wooden panels**: A sloped section on the **left foreground** with 5–6 horizontal slat panels (1.2m tall x 2m wide each) attached to a concrete frame.  \n- **Metal rebar**: Thin, curved silver rods protruding from concrete chunks.  \n- **Miscellaneous debris**: Bricks (red/brown), wooden planks (brown), plastic sheets (gray/blue), and a coiled metal pipe (silver) on the left.  \n\n**Human figures** (≈35 total) are distributed across the rubble:  \n- **Dark-clad workers/onlookers**: 25–30 people in black, dark gray, or navy jackets/pants, with varying postures (standing, sitting, walking, crouching). One wears a white helmet; another has a gray hood.  \n- **Rescue workers**: 8–10 people in **bright orange high-visibility suits** (full-body, with reflective strips) and helmets, clustered in the **center-right**. Two carry an **orange stretcher** (2m long) with a dark-clad person assisting.  \n- **Military/police**: 3–5 people in camouflage uniforms, standing near the rescue workers.  \n\n**Background infrastructure**:  \n- **Damaged buildings**: 3–4 multi-story structures (2–4 stories) with flat roofs, missing walls, and faded exteriors (beige/light brown). The closest (right) is a 3-story building with a collapsed wall; a 4-story building with balconies sits behind the red machine.  \n- **Red excavator**: A mobile hydraulic excavator on the **right edge** (tracked undercarriage: black; arm: red; bucket: yellow; cab: black).  \n- **Sky**: Uniform overcast (no distinct clouds).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Colors** (Hex codes approximate, based on photo tones):  \n- **Rubble**:  \n  - Concrete chunks: Light gray (#e0e0e0) with dark gray (#404040) chipped edges.  \n  - Wooden panels: Medium brown (#8b4513) with dark brown (#5c3317) slat lines.  \n  - Bricks: Red-brown (#a0522d).  \n  - Metal rebar: Silver (#c0c0c0).  \n- **People**:  \n  - Dark clothing: Black (#000000), dark gray (#2f2f2f), navy (#191970).  \n  - Rescue suits: Bright orange (#ff6600) with white reflective strips.  \n  - Camouflage: Olive drab (#556b2f) with tan (#d2b48c) accents.  \n- **Machinery**:  \n  - Excavator arm: Red (#cc0000); bucket: Yellow (#ffff00); cab: Black (#000000).  \n- **Environment**:  \n  - Sky: Pale gray (#d3d3d3) (overcast, diffused light).  \n  - Background buildings: Beige (#f5f5dc), light brown (#d2b48c).  \n  - Grass: Olive green (#6b8e23) (distant patch).  \n- **Smoke**: White (#ffffff) with subtle gray (#f0f0f0) gradients (backlit by sky).  \n\n#### **Textures** (Vector-friendly representations):  \n- **Concrete**: Rough, porous surface—add subtle noise (10–15% opacity) or diagonal cross-hatching.  \n- **Wood**: Weathered, splintered—add horizontal slat lines (1px width, dark brown) to rectangular panels.  \n- **Metal rebar**: Smooth, reflective—use gradient from silver to light gray.  \n- **Smoke**: Wispy, translucent—use Bezier curves with soft edges (50–70% opacity) and radial gradients (white center, gray edges).  \n- **Clothing**: Dark fabrics—matte (solid fill); orange rescue suits—shiny (add subtle specular highlights).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centrally focused** on the rubble pile, with depth created by layered background elements. Key spatial hierarchy:  \n\n#### **Foreground (0–30% of image height)**  \n- **Left**: Sloped rubble section with wooden panels (1.5m tall) and 5–6 dark-clad people (sitting/standing). Concrete pillars (2m tall) frame the left edge.  \n- **Center/Right**: Pile of irregular concrete chunks (1–2m tall) with 4 standing pillars (1.5–3m tall) spaced 2–3m apart.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground (30–70% of image height)**  \n- **Center**: Dense activity:  \n  - **Smoke cloud**: 3m wide x 2m tall, rising from between two pillars.  \n  - **Rescue workers**: Clustered in a 2m x 3m area (center-right), with the orange stretcher (carried by two people) at the group’s core.  \n  - **Dark-clad workers**: Scattered across the rubble, walking or standing.  \n- **Right**: Red excavator (4m tall) positioned at the edge of the rubble, its arm extending diagonally toward the center.  \n\n#### **Background (70–100% of image height)**  \n- **Buildings**: Layered from closest (right: 3-story, damaged) to farthest (left: 2-story, intact). Distant buildings are smaller and less detailed (beige/light brown).  \n- **Grass**: Narrow patch (5m wide) behind the excavator, with 10–15 tiny figures (observers).  \n- **Sky**: Occupies the top 20% of the image, blending seamlessly with the distant buildings.  \n\n#### **Proportions**  \n- **Human scale**: Average person = 1.7m tall (used to gauge object sizes):  \n  - Concrete pillars: 2–3x human height.  \n  - Excavator arm: 5x human height.  \n  - Smoke cloud: 1.5x human height (width).  \n- **Rubble pile**: Occupies 70% of the image width (left to right) and 80% of the height (bottom to top).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The image is a photograph, so the SVG must prioritize **detail and accuracy** (e.g., chipped concrete, fabric folds, machinery details).  \n- **Depth of Field**: Foreground rubble is sharp; background buildings are slightly blurred (use Gaussian blur: 2–3px for distant structures).  \n- **Lighting**: Diffused, overcast sky—no harsh shadows. Smoke is backlit, making its center brighter than edges.  \n- **Composition**: Busy, dynamic layout with the **smoke and rescue workers** as the visual focal point (rule of thirds: smoke at intersection of left/center vertical thirds).  \n- **Contrast**: Bright orange rescue suits and red excavator create high contrast against the gray rubble and sky, drawing attention to the operation.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No visible text** (small logos on the excavator are indistinct and can be omitted for simplicity).  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - **Orange suits**: Universal symbol for rescue workers (key to conveying the scene’s context).  \n  - **Stretcher**: Orange cover (1.8m long x 0.6m wide) carried by two people (center), indicating a casualty.  \n  - **Smoke**: Signals recent collapse or ongoing debris removal.  \n- **Key Details**:  \n  - **Metal rebar**: 5–10 thin rods (0.5cm diameter) sticking out from concrete chunks (left/middle).  \n  - **Wooden panels**: 6 horizontal slats per panel (10cm thick, 5cm spacing).  \n  - **Excavator**: Tracked undercarriage (black, 1m wide) with a yellow bucket (0.5m tall) at the arm’s end.  \n  - **People**:  \n    - **Left group**: 1 person crouching (inspecting rubble), 2 sitting (on wooden panels), 2 standing (watching).  \n    - **Center group**: 8 orange-suited workers (3 with helmets, 2 holding tools), 1 person carrying a red tool (near smoke), 2 carrying the stretcher.  \n    - **Right group**: 3 people standing near the excavator (1 in a black jacket, 2 in dark gray).  \n- **Smoke**: Wispy edges (Bezier curves) with a radial gradient (white center, gray edges) to simulate translucency.  \n\n\n### **SVG Creation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, prioritize **vectorizable shapes** and **layered elements**:  \n- **Rubble**: Group into 10–15 large chunks (rectangular/triangular) with chipped edges; add smaller debris (circles/squares) for texture.  \n- **Pillars**: Rectangular prisms with tapered tops (use path tools to create chipped edges).  \n- **People**: Simplified human figures (use basic shapes: circles for heads, rectangles for bodies, lines for limbs). Focus on posture (e.g., standing = vertical rectangle; sitting = angled rectangle).  \n- **Smoke**: Use 3–5 overlapping Bezier curves with soft edges (50% opacity) and a radial gradient.  \n- **Background**: Flatten distant buildings (solid fills with subtle shadows) to maintain focus on the foreground.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s chaos, activity, and emotional tone while retaining the precision required for vector graphics.",
  "v1_103": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed breakdown covers all critical elements—from geometric shapes to color values—organized by the user’s specified categories:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **woman** in a celebratory pose, holding an **Academy Award (Oscar) statuette** and touching her chest. A **microphone** dominates the foreground, and a **gradient background with golden stripes** frames the scene.\n\n#### **Primary Subject: Woman**\n- **Pose**: Standing with weight slightly shifted to her left foot (viewer’s right), leaning forward.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Woman**: Centered in the image (50% from left/right). Occupies 85% of the height (top of head to hem) and 50% of the width (shoulders to hips).  \n- **Oscar**: Held in the woman’s left hand (viewer’s right), positioned 60% from the left edge and 50% from the top. The statuette’s base rests against her hip.  \n- **Microphone**: Foreground element, 60% from the left edge and 70% from the top. Mic head overlaps the lower third of the image; the pole extends downward out of the frame.  \n- **Background Stripes**: Frame the woman, with the left stripe starting at the top-left corner and the right stripe at the top-right. They converge at the center top (10% overlap), creating a spotlight effect.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism with Vector Simplification**: Detailed features (hair, feathers) are translated into geometric shapes (curves, rectangles) with gradients/opacity for depth.  \n- **Dramatic Lighting**: Warm front lighting on the woman (highlights on cheeks/shoulders) contrasts with the backlit golden stripes. The radial gradient background draws focus to the subject.  \n- **Emotional Tone**: The woman’s smile (open mouth, crinkled eyes) and hand-on-chest pose convey joy and celebration. Subtle shadows (under arms, behind hair) add realism.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Text, Symbols, and Precision)**\n- **No Text**: The image contains no visible text.  \n- **Oscar Symbolism**: The 5 spokes on the film reel represent the Academy’s 5 branches (actors, writers, directors, producers, technicians).  \n- **Accessory Precision**:  \n  - **Headband**: 1px thick, with rhinestones spaced 5px apart.  \n  - **Earrings**: Each drop is 3” long (relative to the image) with 5–6 rectangular stones (2px x 4px) spaced 3px apart.  \n  - **Ring**: The diamond is 0.5” in diameter (relative), with a halo of 6 small stones (1px each) arranged in a circle.  \n- **Nail Polish**: Applied to all fingers, with a 1px white stroke on the tips for a glossy finish.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout (Critical for SVG)**\nUse the following relative proportions (based on a 1000px x 1000px image) to maintain accuracy:  \n| Element | Proportion | Position |\n|---------|------------|----------|\n| **Woman** | Height = 850px (85% of image), Width = 500px (50% of image). | Centered (500px from left/right). |\n| **Oscar** | Height = 250px (30% of woman’s height), Width = 75px (15% of woman’s width). | Held in the woman’s left hand (600px from left, 500px from top). |\n| **Microphone** | Mic Head = 150px (15% of image width). | 600px from left, 700px from top. |\n| **Background Stripes** | Each stripe = 200px (20% of image width). | Left stripe: Starts at (0px, 0px), angles 10° right.

Ribbons: **red (#FF0000)** (matte, with a subtle vertical gradient from dark red at the top to light red at the bottom). | Medals have a shiny, reflective surface (simulated with radial gradients); ribbons are soft and slightly folded. |  \n| **Central Cloak** | **Black (#000000)** (long, flowing, covering the player’s shoulders and arms). | Semi-transparent at the edges (to simulate fabric movement) with a slight texture for depth. |  \n| **Fireworks** | **White (#FFFFFF)** (primary sparks) and **gold (#FFD700)** (secondary sparks). | Glowing, with a faint outer glow (blur effect) to mimic light. Sparks are small circles/lines with varying opacities (10–100%). |  \n| **Background** | **Warm orange (#FFA500)** and **white** (gradient from bright white at the top to soft orange at the bottom, with subtle smoke haze). | Diffused, with a \"glow\" effect to simulate stadium lights. |  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe group is tightly packed in a **triangular formation**, with the central figure as the apex. Players are arranged in **3 rows**:  \n- **Front Row** (5 players): Closest to the camera, with arms around each other or raised. Visible numbers: 17 (left), 11 (center-left), 22 (right).  \n- **Middle Row** (6 players): Includes the central figure (number 10) holding the trophy. This row is slightly elevated, with players leaning into the front row.  \n- **Back Row** (4 players): Standing behind the middle row, with arms raised or around teammates. A goalkeeper in a **green jersey** (number 23, partial visibility) is in the back-right.  \n\n#### **Key Spatial Proportions**  \n- **Jersey Stripes**: Each light blue/white stripe is **1:1 width** (e.g., 1.5cm blue + 1.5cm white).  \n- **Trophy**: The trophy is **~1.2x the height of the central player’s head** (from his hands to the top of the globe). The base is ~1/3 the total trophy height.  \n- **Medals**: Each medal is **~5cm in diameter** (1/10 the width of a jersey). Ribbons are **~30cm long** (hanging from the neck to the waist).  \n- **Fireworks**: Sparks range from **0.5px to 3px** in diameter (vector circles), with larger sparks in the foreground (top-left/right) and smaller sparks in the background (center-top).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **high-resolution photograph**, but for SVG conversion, it must be simplified into **vector shapes** with:  \n- **Flat Design with Gradients**: Jerseys use solid stripes; medals and the trophy use radial gradients to simulate shine.  \n- **Geometric Precision**: Stripes are straight, vertical rectangles; medals are perfect circles; the trophy’s handles are symmetrical curves.  \n- **Depth Cues**:  \n  - **Overlapping**: Players in the front row overlap those in the middle/back rows (e.g., the player with number 17’s arm overlaps the player with number 11).  \n  - **Size Variation**: Front-row players are slightly larger (10–15%) than back-row players.  \n  - **Firework Glow**: A subtle Gaussian blur (vector filter) on spark edges to create a \"glow\" effect.  \n- **Texture Simplification**: Tattoos (e.g., central player’s left arm, player 22’s right arm) are represented as simple vector lines/shapes (not detailed realism).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \n- **Jersey Numbers**: Bold, black sans-serif font (e.g., \"Arial Black\") on the front of each jersey. Numbers are **centered** and **~10cm tall** (relative to jersey size). Visible numbers: 10 (central), 11, 17, 22.  \n- **FIFA Patch**: A small rectangular patch on the **right sleeve** of each jersey, with the text \"FIFA WORLD CUP QATAR 2022\" in white (vector text).  \n\n#### **Symbols**  \n- **Adidas Logo**: Three black horizontal stripes on the **left chest** of each jersey (vector icon, ~3cm tall).  \n- **FIFA World Cup Trophy**: Accurate to the real trophy’s design:  \n  - **Cup**: Two curved handles meeting at the top, with a \"ribbed\" texture (subtle vertical lines).  \n  - **Base**: A cylindrical shape with engraved text (simplified to horizontal lines for SVG).  \n  - **Globe**: A sphere with faint latitude/longitude lines (vector circles/ellipses).  \n\n#### **Specific Details**  \n- **Central Figure’s Cloak**: A long, black rectangle with a \"flowing\" effect (vector points adjusted to create slight curves at the edges).  \n- **Tattoos**:  \n  - Central player: A tattoo on his **left arm** (visible when holding the trophy)—represented as a simple vector line (e.g., a tribal design).  \n  - Player 22: A tattoo on his **right arm** (visible when he raises his hand)—represented as a series of small circles/lines.  \n- **Medal Ribbons**: Red rectangles with a **vertical gradient** (dark red at the top, light red at the bottom) to simulate folds.  \n- **Goalkeeper’s Jersey**: A solid green rectangle (back-right) with a white collar and partial number 23 (black text).  \n\n\n### **6. Additional Notes for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Layer Order**:  \n  1. Background (fireworks + gradient).  \n  2. Back-row players.  \n  3. Middle-row players (including central figure and trophy).  \n  4. Front-row players.  \n  5. Medals + ribbons (on top of jerseys).  \n  6. Trophy (on top of all elements except fireworks).  \n- **Transparency**: The central figure’s cloak uses **5–10% transparency** at the edges to simulate fabric movement.  \n- **Trophy Details**: The globe on top of the trophy has subtle **map contours** (vector lines) to distinguish continents.  \n\n\nThis description provides the geometric, color, and spatial information required to convert the photograph into a precise SVG, with a focus on reproducible vector shapes and realistic proportions. The key is to balance detail (e.g., jersey stripes, medal gradients) with simplicity (e.g., tattoo simplification, firework spark shapes) to maintain fidelity while ensuring the SVG is scalable and efficient.",
  "v1_105": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, below is a **comprehensive, structured description** of its visual elements, spatial relationships, and technical details. The image depicts a close-up of a person kissing a large, ornate trophy, with a dramatic, spotlight-style background.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition centers on two primary subjects:  \n- **A Person**: Upper body (head, neck, torso) wearing a light zip-up jacket, with short dark hair.  \n- **A Trophy**: The **Norman Brookes Challenge Cup** (identifiable by its iconic design), held in the person’s right hand (viewer’s right side).  \n\n#### **Person Details**\n- **Head**: Short, straight dark hair (styled forward, with a subtle part on the left). Face is turned slightly toward the trophy, with eyes closed and lips touching the trophy’s left side.  \n- **Jacket**: High-collared, lightweight (windbreaker-style) with a central zipper (red pull visible at the top). Left chest (viewer’s left) features a stylized **number \"22\"** (see §5 for details).  \n- **Arm/Hand**: Right arm (viewer’s right) is bent at the elbow, gripping the trophy’s base just below the cup. Wrist wears a **dark-colored watch** (band + circular face).  \n- **Posture**: Torso is slightly tilted toward the trophy, with shoulders squared.  \n\n#### **Trophy Details**\nThe trophy consists of two main parts:  \n- **Cup**: Ornate, polished silver bowl with:  \n  - Curved, bulbous shape (wider at the top than the base).  \n  - Two decorative handles (one fully visible on the right side, partial on the left) with intricate engravings (floral motifs, scrollwork).  \n  - Domed top with raised decorative elements (e.g., a coat of arms or geometric patterns).  \n- **Base**: Thick, rectangular black pedestal (matte finish) with:  \n  - A smaller rectangular \"neck\" at the top (where the cup attaches).  \n  - **Front Plaque**: Glossy, rectangular panel (centered on the base) with embossed text (see §5).  \n  - **Side Plaque**: Narrow, vertical panel on the right side (viewer’s right) with a list of names (previous winners).  \n\n#### **Background**\nA **radial gradient background** (dark blue at the center, fading to black at the edges) creates a \"spotlight\" effect, drawing focus to the person and trophy.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Trophy**\n- **Cup**: Polished silver with **highly reflective texture**. Highlights (bright white) on the upper right (from a top-right light source), fading to medium gray in mid-tones and deep gray/black in shadows (left side). Engravings are raised and slightly darker than the base silver.  \n- **Base**: Matte black with a **glossy front plaque**. The plaque reflects faint orange/yellow \"stadium light\" highlights (small, dot-like shapes). Side plaque has gold-colored text (names) against the black base.  \n\n#### **Person**\n- **Jacket**: Light gray/off-white with a **subtle sheen**. Gradient from light gray (right side, catch light) to dark gray (left side, shadow). Red zipper pull at the top of the central zipper.  \n- **Hair**: Deep black with a matte texture (no highlights).  \n- **Watch**: Dark blue/black band (rubber/leather texture) with a silver bezel (circular, metallic).  \n- **Number \"22\"**: Dark green (near-forest green) with a **slightly raised, embroidered texture**. Subtle gradient (darker center, lighter edges) for depth.  \n\n#### **Background**\nRadial gradient: **Dark blue (#001f3f)** at the center, fading to **black (#000000)** at the edges. No texture—smooth, solid gradient.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image is **horizontal (wider than tall)** with a 3:2 aspect ratio (approximate). Key spatial hierarchy:  \n- **Person**: Occupies the **left 1/3 to 1/2** of the image. Head is at the top-left quadrant; torso extends from the mid-left to the bottom edge.  \n- **Trophy**: Dominates the **center to right 1/2** of the image. The cup is positioned at the top-center, touching the person’s lips (left side of the cup). The base rests in the person’s right hand (viewer’s right), with the front plaque facing the camera.  \n- **Light Source**: Upper-right corner (off-frame), casting highlights on the trophy’s cup, the right side of the person’s face/jacket, and the watch.  \n\n#### **Proportions**\n- **Trophy**:  \n  - Base: Rectangular, ~15cm wide (front-to-back) × 20cm tall (top-to-bottom) × 30cm deep (left-to-right).  \n  - Cup: ~30cm tall (from base neck to top) × 25cm in diameter (widest point).  \n- **Person**:  \n  - Head: ~15cm tall (1/3 of the image height).  \n  - Jacket: Covers the torso (from neck to waist), ~40cm tall.  \n- **Watch**: ~5cm in diameter (1/4 the width of the wrist).  \n\n#### **Key Alignments**\n- The trophy’s cup is **centered vertically** with the person’s face (lips touch the cup’s left edge).  \n- The jacket’s zipper runs **vertically through the center** of the person’s torso.  \n- The number \"22\" is **aligned with the left chest** (viewer’s left), 5cm below the collar.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: Highly detailed textures (metal, fabric, hair) and natural proportions.  \n- **Dramatic Lighting**: High contrast between the bright trophy/jacket and dark background (vignetting). Catch lights on the trophy’s cup and person’s jacket create depth.  \n- **Composition**: Rule of thirds—person’s head at left third, trophy at right third. The trophy’s base leads the eye upward to the cup and person’s face.  \n- **Focus**: Shallow depth of field—person and trophy are in sharp focus; background is blurred (gradient).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Trophy Text**\n- **Front Plaque (Base)**:  \n  - **Primary Text**: \"Norman Brookes Challenge Cup\" (embossed, gold-colored, serif font).  \n  - **Secondary Text**: Year of victory (e.g., \"2023\") below the primary text (smaller, same font).  \n- **Side Plaque (Base, Right Side)**:  \n  - **Names**: List of previous winners (embossed, gold-colored, sans-serif font). Text is **vertical** (runs top-to-bottom) due to the plaque’s orientation.  \n\n#### **Jacket Symbol**\n- **Number \"22\"**: Styled in a **custom sans-serif font** on the left chest (viewer’s left). The \"2\"s have a slight curve (not perfectly straight) and are slightly thicker at the base. The number is **10cm tall** (1/4 the height of the jacket).  \n\n#### **Trophy Engravings**\n- **Cup**: Intricate floral patterns (roses, leaves) on the sides and handles. A small **coat of arms** (Australian Open logo) is embossed on the front of the cup (center, below the top rim).  \n- **Handles**: Scrollwork and decorative motifs (e.g., acanthus leaves) on the edges.  \n\n#### **Miscellaneous Details**\n- **Person’s Ear**: Visible on the left side (viewer’s left) of the head, with a slight shadow under the hair.  \n- **Trophy Base Ledge**: A 1cm-wide ledge at the top of the base (between the base and cup neck) for structural detail.  \n- **Watch Band**: Wraps around the wrist twice (visible on the top and bottom of the wrist).  \n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Technical Notes**\nTo ensure accurate reproduction, the following details are critical for SVG paths/shapes:  \n- **Trophy Cup**: Use **bezier curves** to replicate the ornate, curved silhouette. Engravings are **subtractive paths** (cut into the cup’s surface) with a darker silver fill.  \n- **Trophy Base**: A **rectangular prism** (3D effect) with front/side plaques as separate layers. The front plaque’s \"stadium light\" reflections are **small circle elements** (orange/yellow) with low opacity.  \n- **Jacket**: A **closed path** (torso + sleeves) with a **linear gradient** (light gray to dark gray) for the sheen. The zipper is a **thin red line** with a small red circle (pull) at the top.  \n- **Number \"22\"**: A **compound path** (two \"2\"s) with a **radial gradient** (dark green center to light green edges) for the embroidered effect.  \n- **Background**: A **radial gradient fill** (dark blue to black) applied to the entire SVG canvas.  \n\n#### **Layer Order (Top to Bottom)**\n1. Trophy cup (with engravings)  \n2. Trophy base (front plaque + side plaque + ledge)  \n3. Person’s hand (gripping base)  \n4. Person’s jacket (with zipper + number \"22\")  \n5. Person’s head (hair + face)  \n6. Watch  \n7. Background gradient  \n\n\nThis description captures all necessary details for an accurate SVG recreation, including geometric precision, texture cues, and spatial logic. The focus on **measurable proportions** (e.g., trophy size, number height) and **layer hierarchy** ensures the SVG will match the image’s visual structure.",
  "v1_106": "To create an accurate SVG recreation of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into **geometric elements, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic cues**. Every detail is optimized for vector precision, including path shapes, layer order, and texture treatments.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a savanna scene with two giraffes as the focal point, surrounded by vegetation and distant terrain. Key elements (from foreground to background) include:\n\n#### **Foreground: Grass**\n- **Shape**: Hundreds of long, slender, irregularly curved blades, clustered into clumps. Blades vary in length (0.5–2 units, arbitrary SVG units) and angle (slightly left/right-curved for naturalism).\n- **Structure**: Clumps are denser near the bottom edge, thinning as they rise to the giraffes’ legs.\n- **Key Details**: Mix of live (green) and dead (brown) grass; dead grass is shorter and scattered.\n\n#### **Midground: Giraffes (2)**\nBoth giraffes are **slender, upright mammals** with long necks, legs, and distinctive patch patterns. They stand side-by-side, reaching for a tree.\n- **Left Giraffe**: \n  - **Posture**: Facing left, neck curved downward to eat from the tree. Head is visible (mouth near leaves), with ears forward.\n  - **Shapes**: \n    - **Head**: Oval (0.8x0.5 units) with two small, conical ossicones (0.2x0.1 units) on top.\n    - **Neck**: Curved rectangle (3x0.6 units) tapering from head to body.\n    - **Body**: Oval (2x1.2 units) with a slight hump (shoulders).\n    - **Legs**: Four long, straight rectangles (3x0.3 units) with darker lower sections (knees to hooves).\n    - **Ears**: Triangular (0.3x0.2 units) with black tips, positioned on either side of the head.\n    - **Eyes**: Small circles (0.1 units) with black pupils and white highlights (0.05 units).\n  - **Patches**: 18–22 irregular, jagged-edged polygons (0.3–1 unit) in dark brown, covering the neck, body, and legs. No two patches are identical.\n- **Right Giraffe**: \n  - **Posture**: Facing the tree, neck curved sharply over the left giraffe’s back (head hidden by foliage). Only the back, legs, and tail are visible.\n  - **Shapes**: \n    - **Body**: Oval (2x1.2 units) with a visible rump.\n    - **Neck**: Curved rectangle (3.5x0.6 units) arching from the body to the tree.\n    - **Legs**: Four long rectangles (3x0.3 units) with tan bases and dark patches.\n    - **Tail**: Thin rectangle (1.5x0.1 units) hanging from the rump, ending in a black tuft (0.2x0.2 units circle).\n  - **Patches**: 15–20 irregular polygons (0.2–0.8 units) on the back, legs, and neck.\n\n#### **Midground: Tree (Acacia)**\n- **Position**: Centered-left, between the two giraffes.\n- **Shapes**: \n  - **Trunk**: Thick, twisted rectangle (1.5x0.4 units) with a gnarled base.\n  - **Branches**: 10–15 thin, angular, curved lines (0.1–0.3 units wide) spreading from the trunk. Branches are bare or sparsely leafed.\n  - **Leaves**: 50–100 small ovals (0.1x0.05 units) clustered at branch tips.\n- **Key Details**: Thorny appearance (implied by thin, pointed branches); leaves are dense where giraffes are feeding.\n\n#### **Background: Distant Hills**\n- **Shape**: 5–10 layered, rounded “waves” (curved rectangles) decreasing in size with distance.\n- **Structure**: Closest hills are largest and darkest; farthest hills are smallest and lightest (depth cue).\n- **Key Details**: Soft, muted edges to mimic atmospheric haze.\n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Shape**: Large rectangle covering the top 1/3 of the image.\n- **Key Details**: Hazy, gradient-filled (no distinct clouds).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors use **hex codes** for consistency. Textures are simulated with vector patterns or filters (avoiding raster images).\n\n#### **Grass**\n- **Live Grass**: Bright green (#60A020) with a slight yellow tint (#80C040) for sunlight.\n- **Dead Grass**: Brown (#806040) with gray undertones (#A08060).\n- **Texture**: Blades have a **10% opacity variation** (80–90%) to mimic depth; dead grass is duller (70% opacity).\n\n#### **Giraffes**\n- **Base Color**: Light tan (#D0B080) for skin.\n- **Patches**: Dark brown (#402000) with irregular, jagged edges (no two patches are identical).\n- **Mane**: Short, brown (#806040) “hairs” along the neck (simulated with a dashed line pattern).\n- **Ossicones/Ears**: Black (#000000) at the tips; ears are tan (#D0B080) with black edges.\n- **Legs**: Lower legs (cannon bones) are black (#000000); upper legs have tan (#D0B080) with dark patches.\n- **Eyes**: Black (#000000) pupils with white (#FFFFFF) highlights (1px circles).\n- **Texture**: Smooth skin (solid fills); patches are high-contrast for visibility.\n\n#### **Tree**\n- **Trunk/Branches**: Gray-brown (#806040) with a rough texture (simulated with a **pattern of small, curved lines** (#604020) at 50% opacity).\n- **Leaves**: Dark green (#406020) for shaded leaves; light green (#80A060) for sunlit leaves (gradient fill for depth).\n- **Texture**: Branches have a “scraggly” appearance (angular paths); leaves are clustered (grouped ovals).\n\n#### **Distant Hills**\n- **Closest Hills**: Dark green (#204010) with a linear gradient (darker at the base, lighter at the top: #204010 → #406020) to mimic receding terrain.\n- **Mid Hills**: Medium green (#406020) with a softer gradient.\n- **Farthest Hills**: Gray-green (#808080) with a light gradient (#808080 → #A0A0A0).\n- **Texture**: Soft edges (feGaussianBlur with σ=1) to simulate haze.\n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Gradient**: Linear gradient from pale gray (#E0E0E0) at the top to darker gray (#C0C0C0) at the horizon.\n- **Texture**: Hazy effect (feGaussianBlur with σ=0.5) and 90% opacity to blend with hills.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nLayer order (from **bottom to top**) is critical for depth:  \n`Sky → Distant Hills → Grass → Giraffes → Tree Trunk/Branches → Tree Leaves`\n\n#### **Giraffes**\n- **Left Giraffe**: Positioned at **1/3 from the left edge**, feet at the bottom 1/3 of the image. Neck curves from the head (left) to the tree (center-left).\n- **Right Giraffe**: Positioned at **2/3 from the left edge**, feet aligned with the left giraffe’s feet. Neck curves over the left giraffe’s back to reach the tree.\n- **Overlap**: The right giraffe’s neck partially covers the left giraffe’s back; both giraffes’ heads are hidden by tree leaves (except the left giraffe’s face).\n\n#### **Tree**\n- **Trunk**: Centered at **1/4 from the left edge**, rising from the grass to the middle of the image.\n- **Branches**: Spread 2 units wide, covering the area where the giraffes’ heads meet.\n- **Leaves**: Clustered at the top of the branches, overlapping the giraffes’ necks and heads.\n\n#### **Grass**\n- **Coverage**: From the bottom edge up to the giraffes’ knees (bottom 1/3 of the image).\n- **Density**: Densest near the bottom; thins as it approaches the giraffes’ legs.\n\n#### **Distant Hills**\n- **Position**: From the middle of the image (where the giraffes’ heads are) up to the sky.\n- **Layer**: Behind the grass and giraffes, but in front of the sky.\n- **Depth**: Closest hills are at the bottom of the hill layer; farthest hills are at the top (near the sky).\n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Position**: Top 1/3 of the image, covering the hills.\n- **Gradient Direction**: Linear (top to bottom) to mimic a hazy horizon.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph**, but the SVG must replicate this with vector techniques. Key stylistic choices:\n\n#### **Organic Shapes**\n- Giraffes, tree branches, and grass blades use **curved, irregular paths** (no perfect circles/rectangles) to mimic natural forms.\n- Giraffe patches are **asymmetrical and jagged** (no repeating patterns) to reflect individual variation.\n\n#### **Depth Cues**\n- **Layer Order**: Foreground elements (grass, giraffes) are on top of background elements (hills, sky).\n- **Color Muting**: Distant hills and sky are desaturated (grays/greens) compared to foreground elements (bright green grass, warm giraffe tones).\n- **Blur**: Farthest hills and sky use **feGaussianBlur** (low σ) to simulate atmospheric haze.\n\n#### **Texture Simulation**\n- **Tree Bark**: A **pattern of small, curved lines** (#604020) on a gray-brown (#806040) background, applied to the trunk and branches.\n- **Grass**: **Opacity variation** (80–90%) on blades to mimic light and shadow.\n- **Giraffe Skin**: Smooth (solid fills) with high-contrast patches to emphasize texture.\n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Direction**: Implied sunlight from the right (giraffes’ left sides are slightly lighter, but not explicitly shaded).\n- **Leaves**: Light green (#80A060) on the right side of the tree (sunlit); dark green (#406020) on the left (shaded).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThere is no text or symbols in the image. Key micro-details for realism:\n\n#### **Giraffes**\n- **Ossicones**: Two small, black (#000000) cones on top of each giraffe’s head (0.2x0.1 units).\n- **Ears**: Triangular, tan (#D0B080) with black tips; left giraffe’s ears are visible (pointing forward).\n- **Tail**: Right giraffe’s tail is a thin, tan (#D0B080) line with a black (#000000) tuft at the end.\n- **Eyes**: Left giraffe’s eyes have a white (#FFFFFF) highlight (1px circle) to add depth.\n- **Mouth**: Left giraffe’s mouth is a small, downward-curved line (#402000) to show it’s eating.\n\n#### **Tree**\n- **Thorns**: Implied by thin, pointed branches (no explicit thorns, but the angular shape suggests them).\n- **Bare Branches**: 3–5 branches have no leaves (adds realism to a savanna tree).\n\n#### **Grass**\n- **Dead Grass**: Scattered brown (#806040) blades among the green grass (10–15% of total blades).\n- **Clumping**: Blades are grouped into 5–10 clumps (each 1–2 units wide) to avoid a “uniform” look.\n\n#### **Distant Hills**\n- **Layered Gradients**: Each hill has a linear gradient (darker at the base, lighter at the top) to mimic the way light hits terrain.\n- **Blur**: Farthest hills have a stronger blur (σ=1.5) than closest hills (σ=0.5) to enhance depth.\n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Technical Notes**\nTo ensure accuracy in reproduction, include these vector-specific details:\n\n#### **Layers**\nUse a **layered structure** (e.g., in Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape) to organize elements:\n- `Sky` (bottom layer)\n- `Distant Hills` (above sky)\n- `Grass` (above hills)\n- `Giraffe Left` (above grass)\n- `Giraffe Right` (above grass, same layer as left giraffe)\n- `Tree Trunk/Branches` (above giraffes)\n- `Tree Leaves` (above trunk/branches)\n\n#### **Patterns**\n- **Tree Bark**: Create a `pattern` element with a 0.5x0.5 unit tile. Inside the tile, draw 3–4 small, curved lines (#604020) at 45° angles. Apply this pattern to the tree trunk and branches.\n- **Giraffe Mane**: Create a `dashed line` pattern (#806040) with 0.1 unit dashes and 0.05 unit gaps. Apply this to a path along the top of each giraffe’s neck.\n\n#### **Filters**\n- **Haze (Sky/Hills)**: Use `feGaussianBlur` with σ=0.5–1.5 (stronger for farther elements) and `feMerge` to blend with the background.\n- **Leaf Depth**: Apply a slight `feGaussianBlur` (σ=0.2) to leaves in the background of the tree (farther from the viewer).\n\n#### **Gradients**\n- **Sky**: Linear gradient (`<linearGradient>`) from #E0E0E0 (top) to #C0C0C0 (bottom).\n- **Hills**: Each hill has a linear gradient (`<linearGradient>`) from dark green (base) to light green (top).\n- **Leaves**: Radial gradient (`<radialGradient>`) from #80A060 (center) to #406020 (edge) for a 3D effect.\n\n#### **Path Precision**\n- **Giraffe Patches**: Draw each patch as a separate `<path>` with a `fill=\"#402000\"` and `stroke=\"#000000\"` (1px stroke) to define edges.\n- **Grass Blades**: Use `<line>` or `<path>` elements with `stroke=\"#60A020\"` (live grass) or `stroke=\"#806040\"` (dead grass) and `stroke-width=\"0.05\"` (thin blades).\n- **Tree Branches**: Use `<path>` elements with `stroke=\"#806040\"` and `stroke-width=\"0.1–0.3\"` (thicker at the base, thinner at the tips).\n\n\n### **7. Final Checklist for SVG Accuracy**\nBefore finalizing, verify these critical details:\n- [ ] Giraffes’ patches are irregular and unique (no repeats).\n- [ ] Tree leaves overlap the giraffes’ heads (except the left giraffe’s face).\n- [ ] Grass density decreases from the bottom to the giraffes’ legs.\n- [ ] Distant hills are layered with decreasing size and increasing blur.\n- [ ] Sky gradient is linear (top to bottom) with a hazy effect.\n- [ ] All colors match the hex codes provided.\n- [ ] Layers are ordered correctly (foreground → background).\n\nBy following this description, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, color, and realism while maintaining the scalability and editability of vector graphics.",

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is dominated by a **front-facing wide-body airplane** (e.g., Boeing 777 or Airbus A350) as the focal point. Supporting elements include a **runway**, **urban skyline**, and **mountain range** in the background.\n\n#### **Airplane (Sharp Focus)**\nThe plane is the only element in sharp focus, with precise geometric details:\n- **Fuselage**: A tall, cylindrical shape tapering slightly from the nose to the tail. The nose is a rounded rectangle with a smooth, curved tip.\n- **Cockpit**: Four small, rectangular windows (2 on each side of the nose) angled slightly upward, with a dark border.\n- **Wings**: Long, rectangular wings with rounded tips, extending horizontally from the fuselage to nearly the image edges. Each wing has a **dihedral angle** (slight upward tilt) and a **winglet** (small, upward-curved triangular extension) at the tip.\n- **Engines**: Two large, circular engines mounted under the wings (one per wing). Each engine has a **silver outer cowling** (thick circular rim) and a **dark inner core** (turbine housing).\n- **Landing Gear**: \n  - **Nose Gear**: Single unit with two black wheels, suspended from a rectangular strut directly below the nose.\n  - **Main Gear**: Two units (one under each wing), each with two black wheels, suspended from rectangular struts. Located further back than the nose gear, aligned with the engines.\n- **Tail**: A tall, narrow vertical stabilizer (fin) at the rear of the fuselage, with a rounded top. Visible above the main landing gear.\n\n#### **Runway (Foreground)**\nA rectangular asphalt surface occupying the bottom 25% of the image, leading to the plane via a **vanishing point**:\n- **Markings**: \n  - **Center Line**: Series of 10–15 alternating white rectangles (2:1 length:width ratio) decreasing in size toward the plane.\n  - **Side Markings**: Parallel white lines running the length of the runway, flanked by 6 rectangular white patches per side (closer to the viewer, at the bottom of the image).\n- **Surface**: Gray asphalt with a subtle textured appearance (simulated via light/dark gradients in SVG).\n\n#### **Cityscape (Middle Ground)**\nBlurred urban skyline behind the plane, occupying the middle 50% of the image:\n- **Buildings**: Mix of tall (center) and short (left/right) rectangular prisms. Tallest buildings (3–4 stories) are centered behind the plane; shorter buildings (1–2 stories) flank them.\n- **Colors**: Muted grays, whites, and pale blues (facades); no sharp details due to blur.\n- **Layout**: Symmetrical around the plane, with denser construction in the center.\n\n#### **Mountains (Background)**\nLow, rounded mountain range in the far background, occupying the top 25% of the image:\n- **Shape**: Curved, irregular轮廓 (silhouette) with no sharp peaks.\n- **Color**: Pale gray (almost white) with a soft blue tint.\n- **Blur**: Highly diffused (simulated via low opacity or Gaussian blur in SVG) to emphasize depth.\n\n#### **Sky**\nGradient background spanning the entire image:\n- **Color**: Light gray at the top, transitioning to a lighter, warm gray (pale yellowish-white) at the horizon.\n- **Tint**: Subtle golden hour glow (simulated via a soft yellow overlay) to unify the composition.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **muted and warm**, with high contrast between the bright plane and soft background:\n- **Airplane**: \n  - Fuselage/Wings: Bright white (RAL 9010) with a smooth, reflective finish (simulated via subtle gradients).\n  - Engines: Silver (RAL 9006) outer cowling; dark gray (RAL 7021) inner core.\n  - Landing Gear: Matte black (RAL 9005).\n  - Nose Light: Intense yellow (RAL 1023) (small circle, ~5% of fuselage height).\n- **Runway**: \n  - Asphalt: Medium gray (RAL 7035) with light gray (RAL 7032) highlights for texture.\n  - Markings: Pure white (RAL 9016) (matte finish).\n- **Cityscape/Mountains**: \n  - Buildings: Muted grays (RAL 7040), whites (RAL 9010), and pale blues (RAL 5015).\n  - Mountains: Pale gray (RAL 7035) with a 10% blue (RAL 5017) overlay.\n- **Sky**: \n  - Top: Light gray (RAL 7038).\n  - Horizon: Warm gray (RAL 7032) with a 5% yellow (RAL 1023) overlay.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **linear perspective** (runway leading to the plane) to create depth:\n- **Plane**: Centered vertically (midpoint of image height) and horizontally (midpoint of image width). Occupies ~30% of image width (wingspan) and ~40% of image height (fuselage).\n  - Wings: Extend to within 5% of left/right image edges.\n  - Engines: Mounted 1/3 of the way from fuselage to wingtip (each engine diameter = 1/4 wing length).\n  - Landing Gear: Nose gear 1/5 of fuselage length from nose; main gear 1/2 of fuselage length from nose (aligned with engine centers).\n- **Runway**: \n  - Center line aligns with the plane’s vertical axis (vanishing point at the plane’s nose).\n  - Side markings are parallel to the center line, 10% of image width from left/right edges.\n- **Cityscape**: \n  - Tallest buildings are directly behind the plane (aligned with its vertical axis).\n  - Shorter buildings fan out to the left/right, creating a \"V\" shape.\n- **Mountains**: \n  - Align with the top of the cityscape, spanning the entire image width.\n  - Peak height is 80% of image height (from bottom).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image emulates **realistic photography with selective focus**:\n- **Focus**: Plane (sharp edges, high detail); background (city/mountains/sky) blurred via **depth of field** (simulated in SVG with Gaussian blur or low-opacity gradients).\n- **Lighting**: Golden hour (warm, soft light) from the front-left:\n  - Plane: Nose light (brightest point); cockpit windows (subtle blue reflection); wing upper surfaces (warm glow); undersides (cool shadow).\n  - Background: Backlit (buildings/mountains appear as silhouettes); sky gradient reinforces light direction.\n- **Contrast**: High between the white plane and muted background (draws attention to the subject).\n- **Balance**: Symmetrical (plane centered, cityscape/mountains balanced left/right) with dynamic tension from the runway’s vanishing point.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text**: None visible (plane livery, runway signs, etc., are blurred or absent).\n- **Symbols**: \n  - Runway markings (standard FAA/IATA design: center line, side stripes, threshold patches).\n  - Winglets (small, upward-curved triangles at wingtips; ~10% of wing length).\n- **Key Details**:\n  - **Cockpit Windows**: Four rectangular panes (2 left/2 right) with rounded corners; ~2% of fuselage height. Tinted blue (RAL 5015) with a slight reflection.\n  - **Tail Fin**: Vertical stabilizer (tall, narrow rectangle with rounded top) at the rear of the fuselage; ~20% of fuselage height.\n  - **Shadow**: Small, dark gray (RAL 7021) rectangle directly below the plane on the runway; decreases in size toward the plane (simulates cast shadow).\n  - **Engine Details**: Each engine has a 10% silver rim (outer cowling) and a 50% dark core (inner turbine); no visible blades (blurred).\n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout for SVG**\nTo ensure accurate scaling, use the **plane’s fuselage height** as the reference unit (100%):\n- **Plane**:\n  - Fuselage: 100% height (vertical); 40% width (horizontal).\n  - Wings: 200% width (wingspan); 10% height (thickness).\n  - Engines: 25% diameter (relative to fuselage width); 15% height (mounted 5% below wing surface).\n  - Landing Gear: Nose gear (15% height); main gear (20% height).\n- **Runway**:\n  - Length: 300% (from bottom of image to plane’s nose).\n  - Width: 150% (relative to plane’s wingspan).\n- **Background**:\n  - Cityscape: 150% height (from plane’s nose to mountain base).\n  - Mountains: 50% height (from mountain base to top of image).\n  - Sky: 100% height/width (covers entire image).\n\n\n### **7. SVG-Specific Notes**\n- **Blur Simulation**: Use **Gaussian blur** (SVG filter) for the background (city/mountains/sky) with varying intensities:\n  - Plane: 0% blur (sharp).\n  - Runway: 10% blur (closest to viewer).\n  - Cityscape: 30% blur (middle ground).\n  - Mountains: 50% blur (far background).\n  - Sky: 20% blur (subtle softness).\n- **Gradients**:\n  - Plane: Linear gradient (white to light gray) on fuselage/ wings to simulate reflection.\n  - Runway: Radial gradient (dark gray to light gray) on asphalt to simulate texture.\n  - Sky: Linear gradient (top: dark gray; bottom: light gray) with a yellow overlay (5% opacity) for golden hour.\n- **Lighting**:\n  - Nose Light: Use a **radial gradient** (yellow to transparent) to simulate brightness falloff.\n  - Wing Glow: Linear gradient (warm white to transparent) on wing upper surfaces.\n\n\n### **Summary of Critical Elements for SVG**\n1. **Centered plane** with sharp details (fuselage, wings, engines, landing gear).\n2. **Runway** with vanishing point (center line, side markings).\n3. **Blurred background** (city/mountains/sky) to create depth.\n4. **Golden hour lighting** (warm tint, nose light, wing glow).\n5. **Symmetrical balance** (cityscape/mountains left/right of the plane).\n\nBy adhering to these specifications, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, style, and visual hierarchy.",

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is soft and neutral, with pops of pastels to add warmth. Textures are varied to create depth:\n\n| Object                | Color                  | Texture/Visual Property                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sofa                  | Off-white (warm white) | Smooth, matte; slight grain for fabric texture.                                         |\n| Man’s Sweater         | Bright white           | **Cable-knit** (raised, textured pattern with alternating loops).                       |\n| Man’s Dress Shirt     | Light lavender         | Smooth, semi-sheer (visible under the sweater).                                         |\n| Man’s Pants           | Jet black              | Thick, matte (formal trousers).                                                         |\n| Woman’s Blouse        | Bright white           | Lightweight, flowy (slight sheen at the cuffs/hem).                                     |\n| Woman’s Leggings      | Dark navy blue         | Stretchy, matte (high-waisted, form-fitting).                                           |\n| Pillows               | Pastel stripes         | **Diagonal stripes** (white base with thin pink/gray lines); woven, slightly textured.  |\n| Blanket (sofa)        | Bright white           | Thin, soft (folded into a rectangle).                                                   |\n| Bookshelf             | Bright white           | Smooth, matte (clean modern lines).                                                     |\n| \"HOME\" Letters        | Bright white           | 3D, slightly raised (matches bookshelf color).                                          |\n| Blue Towels (shelf)   | Light sky blue         | Folded, textured (terry cloth).                                                         |\n| Walker                | Silver (metallic)      | Shiny, reflective (aluminum frame with rubber tips on legs).                            |\n| Curtains              | Sheer white            | Translucent, with a subtle **micro-checkerboard pattern** (visible when backlit).       |\n| Wall                  | Pure white             | Flat, matte (no texture).                                                               |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is balanced, with the man as the focal point. Key spatial relationships:\n\n#### **Primary Figures**\n- **Man**: Centered on the sofa, occupying ~60% of the sofa’s width. \n  - **Vertical Position**: Seat height of the sofa is ~1.5 ft (from floor to seat); the man’s shoulders are ~3 ft from the floor. \n  - **Horizontal Position**: Left armrest of the sofa is at the image’s left third; the man’s right arm extends toward the woman. \n- **Woman**: Standing to the man’s **right** (viewer’s right), angled 45° toward him. \n  - **Posture**: Torso leaning forward (chest close to the man’s shoulder); knees bent slightly (135°) to lower her center of gravity. \n  - **Hand Placement**: \n    - Right hand: Rests on the man’s left shoulder (palm flat, fingers spread slightly). \n    - Left hand: Grips the man’s right forearm (fingers wrapped around his wrist and forearm, thumb on top). \n  - **Proximity to Man**: Her body is ~6 inches from his right side; her head is level with his shoulders (due to leaning down). \n\n#### **Furniture/Decor**\n- **Sofa**: \n  - **Size**: ~6 ft wide (from left to right armrest); ~3 ft deep (front to back). \n  - **Position**: Against the left wall (curtains behind it); the man sits ~1 ft from the back of the sofa (with pillows between him and the sofa’s backrest). \n  - **Pillows**: Two pillows, each ~2 ft tall x 1.5 ft wide, placed symmetrically behind the man (one on each side of his back). \n- **Bookshelf**: \n  - **Size**: ~4 ft tall x 2 ft wide x 1 ft deep. \n  - **Position**: Flush against the back wall, centered behind the woman. The \"HOME\" letters extend ~6 inches above the shelf’s top edge. \n- **Walker**: \n  - **Size**: ~3 ft tall x 2 ft wide (handle width). \n  - **Position**: To the **right of the woman** (viewer’s right), ~1 ft from her legs. The front legs are ~2 ft from the sofa’s right armrest. \n- **Curtains**: \n  - **Size**: ~8 ft tall x 4 ft wide (per panel). \n  - **Position**: Hanging from a rod above a window (left side of the image), covering ~30% of the left background. \n\n#### **Depth Cues**\n- **Overlap**: The woman’s body overlaps the bookshelf and walker; the man’s body overlaps the sofa and pillows. \n- **Scale**: The walker is smaller than the woman (consistent with real-world proportions). \n- **Lighting**: Soft natural light from the left (window) creates subtle shadows: \n  - Man’s left side (facing the window) is brighter; his right side (facing the woman) is in mild shadow. \n  - Woman’s face is partially shaded (due to leaning over the man). \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **clean, modern, and warm aesthetic** with minimal clutter. Key style elements:\n- **Minimalism**: Few objects (sofa, bookshelf, walker) keep the composition uncluttered. \n- **Soft Lighting**: Natural light from the left creates even illumination with gentle shadows (no harsh contrasts). \n- **Modern Design**: The sofa, bookshelf, and walker have sleek, straight lines (contrasting with the man’s textured sweater and the woman’s flowy blouse). \n- **Emotional Tone**: Warm and supportive (conveyed by the woman’s posture and the man’s relaxed expression). \n\n#### **Artistic Choices for SVG**\n- **Line Work**: Use smooth, clean lines for furniture (sofa, bookshelf) and organic lines for human figures (hair, clothing folds). \n- **Shading**: Subtle gradient shading to simulate texture (e.g., cable-knit sweater, woven pillows). \n- **Negative Space**: The empty wall and sheer curtains create breathing room, keeping focus on the figures. \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **\"HOME\" Letters**: Large uppercase letters attached to the top of the bookshelf. \n  - **Style**: Block font (sans-serif), ~1 ft tall each. \n  - **Position**: Centered horizontally on the shelf; \"H\" is leftmost, \"E\" is rightmost. \n- **Walker Details**: \n  - **Frame**: U-shaped with two horizontal crossbars (connecting the front and back legs). \n  - **Handles**: Rubberized, curved (ergonomic grip); positioned ~3 ft from the floor. \n  - **Legs**: Four vertical legs (two front, two back) with black rubber tips (for traction). \n- **Pillow Stripes**: Diagonal stripes (45° angle) in alternating white, light pink, and gray. Each stripe is ~0.5 inches wide. \n- **Man’s Sweater**: Cable-knit pattern with **2x2 loops** (two rows of knit, two rows of purl) for texture. The collar is a 1-inch ribbed band. \n- **Woman’s Blouse**: Long sleeves with rolled cuffs (1 inch wide); the hem falls to mid-thigh (covering the top of her leggings). \n- **Curtain Pattern**: Subtle micro-checkerboard (1x1 inch squares) in white and light gray (visible only when backlit by the window). \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Geometric Precision**\nFor accurate SVG reproduction, use the following proportional guidelines (based on a 1000px x 700px canvas):\n- **Canvas**: 1000px (width) x 700px (height) (horizontal orientation). \n- **Man’s Height (Sitting)**: 400px (from floor to top of head). \n  - **Head**: 80px tall (1/5 of his sitting height). \n  - **Shoulders**: 120px wide (3x head width). \n- **Woman’s Height (Standing)**: 550px (from floor to top of head). \n  - **Head**: 70px tall (1/8 of her height). \n  - **Shoulders**: 100px wide (1.4x head width). \n- **Sofa**: 800px wide (80% of canvas width) x 300px deep (43% of canvas height). \n  - **Armrests**: 50px wide (each); curved at the top. \n- **Bookshelf**: 300px tall (43% of canvas height) x 200px wide (20% of canvas width). \n  - **\"HOME\" Letters**: 60px tall each (20% of shelf height). \n- **Walker**: 400px tall (57% of canvas height) x 150px wide (15% of canvas width). \n  - **Crossbars**: 100px long (connecting front/back legs). \n\n#### **Key Alignment Points**\n- **Man’s Right Arm**: Extends 150px from his shoulder toward the woman (her left hand grips the midpoint of his forearm). \n- **Woman’s Left Hand**: 200px from her shoulder (aligned with the man’s right elbow). \n- **Walker’s Front Legs**: 100px from the woman’s right leg (viewer’s right). \n- **Pillows**: Centered behind the man; each pillow is 250px tall x 180px wide (62.5% of the man’s sitting height). \n\n\n### **7. Final Layout Summary**\n| Element               | Position (Canvas Coordinates) | Size (px) |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| Sofa                  | Left: 0px; Bottom: 700px      | 800x300   |\n| Man                   | Center: 350px; Bottom: 700px  | 400x400   |\n| Woman                 | Center: 650px; Bottom: 700px  | 550x300   |\n| Bookshelf             | Right: 500px; Bottom: 700px   | 300x200   |\n| Walker                | Right: 850px; Bottom: 700px   | 400x150   |\n| Pillows (2)           | Left: 100px; Top: 300px       | 250x180   |\n| \"HOME\" Letters        | Center: 600px; Top: 100px     | 60x60 each|\n\n\n### **Notes for SVG Artists**\n- **Texture Simulation**: Use **pattern fills** for the cable-knit sweater (repeat 2x2 loops) and striped pillows (diagonal 45° stripes). \n- **Lighting**: Add subtle **linear gradients** (white to light gray) to the left side of the man’s face/body (to simulate window light) and the woman’s back (to show depth). \n- **Human Figures**: Use **bezier curves** for organic shapes (hair, clothing folds) and keep joints (elbows, knees) aligned with real-world anatomy. \n- **Walker**: Draw the frame as a **stroked path** (2px width, silver color) with rubber tips as small black circles (5px diameter). \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, style, and emotional tone while maintaining geometric precision.",

Subtle **diagonal texture** (`#800080`, 1px lines, 45° angle).            |\n| **Person’s Jeans**   | `#191970` (dark blue) | Denim. Minimal texture (solid color for simplicity).                                      |\n| **Person’s Hands**   | `#F0D9B5` (peach) | Smooth skin. Subtle **knuckle curves** (light gray: `#D3D3D3`).                           |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses **one-point perspective** (vanishing point behind the cabinet) to create depth. Objects are positioned relative to a **coordinate system** where:  \n- `(0,0)` = Bottom-left corner of the image.  \n- `x-axis` = Horizontal (left → right).  \n- `y-axis` = Vertical (bottom → top).  \n\n#### Key Positioning (Relative to Drawer)\nThe **drawer** is the focal point, pulled out from the cabinet. It occupies the **center-right** of the image.  \n\n| Object               | Coordinates (x, y) | Dimensions (Width × Height) | Notes                                                                 |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Drawer**           | `(30, 20)`         | `100 × 80`                  | Pulled out from cabinet; front edge at `y=20`.                     |\n| **Trash Can**        | `(65, 0)`          | `60 × 120`                   | Fits snugly in right compartment; top extends 40 units above drawer.  |\n| **Liner**            | `(60, 100)`        | `70 × 30`                    | Folded over trash can top; edges ruffled (subtle waves).             |\n| **Countertop**       | `(0, 100)`         | `130 × 50`                   | Horizontal surface; left of drawer; top at `y=150`.                  |\n| **Mat**              | `(0, 100)`         | `60 × 40`                    | On counter; left of drawer; pattern aligned with counter edges.      |\n| **Green Bowl**       | `(15, 140)`        | `30 × 10`                    | Hemisphere; bottom at `y=140` (sits on counter).                    |\n| **Metal Tray**       | `(0, 100)`         | `20 × 20`                    | On counter; far left; thin (1–2px height).                           |\n| **Cabinet**          | `(0, 150)`         | `130 × 50`                   | Background; above counter; black strip at `x=20–30`.                 |\n| **Person’s Shirt**   | `(40, 0)`          | `90 × 100`                   | Upper body; covers arms/hands; sleeves at `x=40–130`.                |\n| **Person’s Jeans**   | `(50, 0)`          | `70 × 20`                    | Lower body; bottom at `y=0` (feet not visible).                      |\n| **Person’s Hands**   | `(80, 100)` (right) <br> `(60, 100)` (left) | `40 × 20` (each)             | Gripping liner; fingers curved around trash can edges.               |\n\n#### Perspective Notes\n- **Drawer**: Pulled out, so its **back edge** (closer to cabinet) is smaller than the front edge (perspective shrinkage).  \n- **Countertop**: Extends from the cabinet (back) to the front edge (closer to viewer); depth created by overlapping with the drawer.  \n- **Person**: Standing in front of the drawer; hands are **foreground** (closer to viewer) than the trash can.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe SVG should mimic the **realistic but simplified** style of the original photograph. Key artistic choices:  \n- **Clean Lines**: All objects use straight/curved paths with minimal detail (e.g., trash can has no handles).  \n- **Depth**: Created via overlapping (e.g., counter in front of cabinet, hands in front of trash can) and perspective (drawer sides converge).  \n- **Texture Simplification**: Speckles, patterns, and wrinkles are represented with vector-friendly elements (`<pattern>`, `<path>`).  \n- **Lighting**: Subtle highlights (e.g., on the green bowl, metal tray) can be added with light gray strokes (`#E0E0E0`) for realism.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No visible text** in the image.  \n- **Mat Pattern**: Repeating **white circles** (10 circles total: 3 columns × 4 rows) on a black background. Circles are evenly spaced (gap = 1/4 circle diameter).  \n- **Liner Wrinkles**: 3–5 wavy lines (`<path>`) along the top and side edges of the liner, set to `#E0E0E0` (lighter than liner).  \n- **Hand Details**: Fingers are represented as **rectangular shapes** with rounded ends; palms are **ovals**; knuckles are subtle curves (`#D3D3D3`).  \n- **Cabinet Strip**: Vertical black rectangle (`10 × 50` units) at `x=20–30` (left edge of cabinet); likely a handle or gap between cabinets.\n\n\n### **6. SVG Layer Structure**\nTo facilitate editing, the SVG should use **layers** (grouped elements) for each object:  \n\n1. **Background**: Cabinet (including black strip).  \n2. **Countertop**: Counter (with speckled pattern) + metal tray.  \n3. **Drawer**: Drawer (white) + left compartment (gray) + right compartment (gray).  \n4. **Trash Can**: Gray rectangular prism.  \n5. **Liner**: White rectangle + ruffled edges (wavy lines).  \n6. **Mat**: Black rectangle + circle pattern.  \n7. **Green Bowl**: Hemisphere (path with `arc` command).  \n8. **Person**: Shirt (purple) + jeans (blue) + hands (peach).  \n\n\n### **7. Critical Details for Reproduction**\n- **Liner Folding**: The liner extends 5–10 units beyond the trash can’s edges and is folded downward. Use `transform=\"rotate(10)\"` on small sections to mimic wrinkles.  \n- **Hand Placement**: Fingers should grip the liner’s **front and side edges** (not the back). The right hand is on the right edge; the left hand is on the left edge.  \n- **Counter Speckles**: Use a `<pattern>` element with small circles (`r=\"1\"`), repeated every `5` units. Apply to the countertop via `fill=\"url(#speckle-pattern)\"`.  \n- **Mat Pattern**: Use a `<pattern>` element with circles (`r=\"5\"`), repeated every `20` units. Apply to the mat via `fill=\"url(#circle-pattern)\"`.  \n- **Perspective**: The drawer’s back edge (closer to cabinet) is 10–15% smaller than the front edge (use `scale(0.85)` on the back face).  \n\n\n### Example SVG Snippets\n#### Speckled Countertop Pattern\n```svg\n<pattern id=\"speckle-pattern\" width=\"5\" height=\"5\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n  <circle cx=\"2.5\" cy=\"2.5\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#A9A9A9\"/>\n</pattern>\n\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"130\" height=\"50\" fill=\"#D3D3D3\" fill-opacity=\"0.8\" pattern=\"url(#speckle-pattern)\"/>\n```\n\n#### Mat Circle Pattern\n```svg\n<pattern id=\"circle-pattern\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n  <circle cx=\"10\" cy=\"10\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n</pattern>\n\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"60\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#000000\" pattern=\"url(#circle-pattern)\"/>\n```\n\n#### Trash Can with Liner\n```svg\n<!-- Trash Can -->\n<rect x=\"65\" y=\"0\" width=\"60\" height=\"120\" fill=\"#808080\" rx=\"5\" ry=\"5\"/>\n\n<!-- Liner (Folded Over) -->\n<rect x=\"60\" y=\"100\" width=\"70\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" fill-opacity=\"0.9\">\n  <animate attributeName=\"d\" values=\"M60,100 Q65,105 70,100; M60,100 Q62,103 70,100\" dur=\"2s\" repeatCount=\"indefinite\"/>\n</rect>\n<!-- Wrinkles (Subtle Waves) -->\n<path d=\"M60,110 Q65,115 70,110 Q75,105 80,110\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\"/>\n<path d=\"M90,110 Q95,115 100,110 Q105,105 110,110\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\"/>\n```\n\n\n### Final Notes for SVG Recreation\n- **Layers**: Use `<g>` (group) elements to organize objects (e.g., `<g id=\"drawer\">` for drawer components).  \n- **Textures**: Apply patterns via `fill=\"url(#pattern-id)\"` to keep the SVG lightweight.  \n- **Perspective**: Use `transform=\"scale(x, y)\"` on background objects (e.g., cabinet) to create depth.  \n- **Details**: Keep wrinkles, speckles, and patterns subtle—overly complex details will bloat the SVG.  \n\nThis description provides all the **geometric, color, and spatial information** needed to accurately recreate the image as a vector SVG. Adjustments to proportions (e.g., unit scale) can be made based on the desired output size, but the relative relationships and details should remain consistent.",
  "v1_11": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, text, and geometric properties**—with a focus on vector-friendly elements (e.g., shapes, coordinates, and scalable text).\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image features **three upright acrylic wine price signs** in the foreground, set against a blurred store background. Key elements include:\n\n### Foreground: Three Acrylic Signs\nEach sign is a **vertical rectangular panel** with a clear acrylic border (transparent) and a white inner background. The core content of each sign includes:\n- **Text**: Product code, brand name, region/size, price, ratings, and wine description.\n- **Wine Cap**: A partially visible black circular wine bottle cap at the bottom (semicircle, as it’s cut off by the sign’s edge).\n\n### Background (Store Interior)\n- **Left**: A person in a gray jacket (standing) and another in a blue shirt (bending over).\n- **Middle**: A wooden counter with a metallic display case (likely for food/wine).\n- **Right**: A red sign with partial white text (\"ICKEN\" and \"PO\"—possibly part of \"CHICKEN\" and \"POULTRY\").\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n### Signs\n- **Border**: Clear acrylic (transparent, simulated with a thin `#cccccc` stroke to indicate edges).\n- **Inner Background**: Solid white (`#ffffff`), smooth texture.\n- **Text**: Black (`#000000`) with varying fonts/sizes (see *Text Details* below).\n- **Wine Cap**: Solid black (`#000000`), circular (50% visible as a semicircle at the bottom of each sign).\n\n### Background\n- **People**: Gray jacket (`#808080`), blue shirt (`#0071c5`).\n- **Counter**: Brown (`#8b4513`) with a subtle wood grain pattern (repeating SVG pattern).\n- **Display Case**: Silver (`#c0c0c0`) with a linear gradient (`#ffffff` to `#808080`) for metallic reflection.\n- **Red Sign**: Solid red (`#ff0000`) with white text (`#ffffff`).\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n### Signs (Foreground)\n- **Layout**: Three signs aligned **horizontally in a row**, left-to-right.  \n- **Spacing**: Equal gap between signs (≈10% of sign width).  \n- **Alignment**: Bottom edges of signs are flush (y-axis aligned), so wine caps (semicircles) are at the same vertical level.  \n- **Depth**: Signs are in focus; background elements are slightly blurred (simulated with a Gaussian blur filter in SVG).\n\n### Background (Store Interior)\n- **Left Person**: Behind the left sign (x=0, y=20 units).  \n- **Middle Counter/Display**: Behind the middle sign (x=12, y=17 units).  \n- **Red Sign**: Behind the right sign (x=24, y=10 units).  \n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Vector Realism**: Signs are rendered as precise geometric shapes (rectangles, semicircles) with solid fills and strokes. Text is vector-based for scalability.  \n- **Depth Cues**: Background elements use blur and lighter opacity to emphasize the foreground signs.  \n- **Texture Simplification**: Wood grain (counter) and metallic (display case) textures are simulated with subtle patterns/gradients (avoiding high-resolution images).  \n\n\n## 5.

Geometric Details and Proportions (SVG-Specific)\nTo ensure scalability, define a **unit system** (e.g., 1 unit = 10px). Below are key dimensions:\n\n### Sign Structure\n| Component | Dimensions (Units) | Notes |\n|-----------|--------------------|-------|\n| Outer Acrylic Border | 10 (width) × 30 (height) | Thin `#cccccc` stroke (0.5 units thick). |\n| Inner White Background | 9 (width) × 29 (height) | Centered within the border (margin: 0.5 units). |\n| Wine Cap | Diameter = 5 units (half sign width) | Semicircle centered at the bottom of the sign (x=5, y=30). |\n\n### Text Positioning (Relative to Inner White Background)\n| Element | Y-Coordinate (From Top of Inner Background) |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Product Code | 0.5 |\n| Brand | 2.0 |\n| Region/Size | 4.0 |\n| Price | 6.0 |\n| Section Title | 9.0 |\n| Rating | 11.0 |\n| Description | 13.0 (first line) |\n\n### Spacing Between Signs\n- Gap between signs: 2 units (total width of all three signs + gaps = 10 + 2 + 10 + 2 + 10 = 34 units).\n\n\n## 7. Layout and Background Elements\n### Foreground Signs\n- Placed in a horizontal row (centered in the image if the canvas is 40 units wide).  \n- Bottom of signs aligns with the bottom of the canvas (y=30 units).\n\n### Background Elements (Simplified for SVG)\n| Element | Shape | Color | Position | Notes |\n|---------|-------|-------|----------|-------|\n| Left Person (Gray Jacket) | Rectangle | `#808080` | x=0, y=20 (2×5 units) | Behind left sign. |\n| Left Person (Blue Shirt) | Rectangle | `#0071c5` | x=1, y=25 (3×2 units) | Bending over (behind left sign). |\n| Middle Counter | Rectangle | `#8b4513` (wood grain pattern) | x=12, y=22 (10×3 units) | Behind middle sign. |\n| Metallic Display Case | Rectangle | `#c0c0c0` (linear gradient: `#ffffff` to `#808080`) | x=12, y=17 (10×5 units) | Above counter (behind middle sign). |\n| Red Sign | Rectangle | `#ff0000` | x=24, y=10 (5×8 units) | Behind right sign. |\n| Red Sign Text | `ICKEN` (top), `PO` (bottom) | White sans-serif (1.5 units) | x=25, y=12 (top); x=25, y=15 (bottom) | Partial letters (e.g., \"CHICKEN\" or \"POULTRY\"). |\n\n\n## 8. Final Notes for SVG Reproduction\n- **Blur Effect**: Apply a Gaussian blur filter (σ=1 unit) to background elements to simulate depth.  \n- **Reflection**: Add a subtle linear gradient to the acrylic border (transparent to `#e0e0e0`) to mimic reflection.  \n- **Drop Shadow**: Add a soft drop shadow to the inner white background (offset: 0.2 units, blur: 0.5 units) to separate it from the border.  \n- **Font Consistency**: Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for all text to match the original image.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s structure, text, and visual hierarchy—while maintaining scalability and vector fidelity.",

Below are key dimensions:\n\n### Sign Structure\n| Component | Dimensions (Units) | Notes |\n|-----------|--------------------|-------|\n| Outer Acrylic Border | 10 (width) × 30 (height) | Thin `#cccccc` stroke (0.5 units thick). |\n| Inner White Background | 9 (width) × 29 (height) | Centered within the border (margin: 0.5 units). |\n| Wine Cap | Diameter = 5 units (half sign width) | Semicircle centered at the bottom of the sign (x=5, y=30). |\n\n### Text Positioning (Relative to Inner White Background)\n| Element | Y-Coordinate (From Top of Inner Background) |\n|---------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Product Code | 0.5 |\n| Brand | 2.0 |\n| Region/Size | 4.0 |\n| Price | 6.0 |\n| Section Title | 9.0 |\n| Rating | 11.0 |\n| Description | 13.0 (first line) |\n\n### Spacing Between Signs\n- Gap between signs: 2 units (total width of all three signs + gaps = 10 + 2 + 10 + 2 + 10 = 34 units).\n\n\n## 7. Layout and Background Elements\n### Foreground Signs\n- Placed in a horizontal row (centered in the image if the canvas is 40 units wide).  \n- Bottom of signs aligns with the bottom of the canvas (y=30 units).\n\n### Background Elements (Simplified for SVG)\n| Element | Shape | Color | Position | Notes |\n|---------|-------|-------|----------|-------|\n| Left Person (Gray Jacket) | Rectangle | `#808080` | x=0, y=20 (2×5 units) | Behind left sign. |\n| Left Person (Blue Shirt) | Rectangle | `#0071c5` | x=1, y=25 (3×2 units) | Bending over (behind left sign). |\n| Middle Counter | Rectangle | `#8b4513` (wood grain pattern) | x=12, y=22 (10×3 units) | Behind middle sign. |\n| Metallic Display Case | Rectangle | `#c0c0c0` (linear gradient: `#ffffff` to `#808080`) | x=12, y=17 (10×5 units) | Above counter (behind middle sign). |\n| Red Sign | Rectangle | `#ff0000` | x=24, y=10 (5×8 units) | Behind right sign. |\n| Red Sign Text | `ICKEN` (top), `PO` (bottom) | White sans-serif (1.5 units) | x=25, y=12 (top); x=25, y=15 (bottom) | Partial letters (e.g., \"CHICKEN\" or \"POULTRY\"). |\n\n\n## 8. Final Notes for SVG Reproduction\n- **Blur Effect**: Apply a Gaussian blur filter (σ=1 unit) to background elements to simulate depth.  \n- **Reflection**: Add a subtle linear gradient to the acrylic border (transparent to `#e0e0e0`) to mimic reflection.  \n- **Drop Shadow**: Add a soft drop shadow to the inner white background (offset: 0.2 units, blur: 0.5 units) to separate it from the border.  \n- **Font Consistency**: Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for all text to match the original image.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s structure, text, and visual hierarchy—while maintaining scalability and vector fidelity.",
  "v1_110": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and geometric details**—critical for precise vector reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **giraffe** and a **human** interacting in a savanna landscape. Key elements include:  \n- **Giraffe**: A young or subadult giraffe with a long, curved neck, head tilted downward, and body positioned to the right of the frame. Visible features: head (ears, eyes, mouth), neck (mane, spots), torso, and partial legs.  \n- **Human**: Standing behind the giraffe’s neck, facing away from the camera. Wearing a **red-and-yellow checkered shawl** draped over shoulders, a **red geometric-patterned dress**, and **colorful wrist bracelets**. One hand rests on the giraffe’s back; the other is obscured by the giraffe’s neck.  \n- **Background**: A dirt path (left), bushy hillside (middle), distant trees (left/right), and a gradient sky (top).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Giraffe**  \n- **Coat**: Base color **white (#FFFFFF)** with **medium brown spots (#8B4513)** outlined in **white (#FFFFFF)**. Spots are irregular polygons (larger on the body, smaller on the head).  \n- **Mane**: Short, stiff hairs along the neck’s top edge—**brown (#A0522D)** with **black (#000000)** tips. Represented as a series of small, upright triangles/lines.  \n- **Ears**: **Gray (#D3D3D3)** with **black (#000000)** tips; inner ears are **white (#FFFFFF)**.  \n- **Eyes**: Large, oval—**black pupil (#000000)** surrounded by a **brown iris (#8B4513)**. Eyelashes: 3–4 thin **black (#000000)** lines above each eye.  \n- **Legs**: Partial view of two front legs (right side). Coat matches the body (brown spots/white lines); hooves are **black (#000000)**.  \n\n#### **Human**  \n- **Shawl**: A thick, woven fabric draped over both shoulders, hanging to the waist. **Red (#FF0000)** base with **yellow (#FFD700)** checkers (1-inch squares with yellow borders). The shawl has subtle folds, so edges are slightly curved.  \n- **Dress**: A loose-fitting garment covering the torso to the knees. **Red (#FF0000)** base with a **dark red (#8B0000)** geometric pattern (repeating diamonds/stripes, 0.5-inch scale).  \n- **Skin**: **Dark brown (#2F1700)** (consistent across face, arms, hands).  \n- **Bracelets**: Three tight-fitting bands on the wrist of the hand touching the giraffe. Colors (from wrist to forearm): **yellow (#FFD700)**, **red (#FF0000)**, **blue (#0000FF)**. Each band is 0.25 inches wide.  \n- **Hands**: One hand (right, viewer’s perspective) rests on the giraffe’s back—fingers spread, nails **light brown (#D2B48C)**. The other hand is obscured by the giraffe’s neck.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Sky**: Top 1/3 of the image. Linear gradient from **light blue (#87CEEB)** (top) to **pale blue (#B0E0E6)** (bottom), with a subtle haze (low opacity). No clouds.  \n- **Hillside**: Middle ground. A curved, bush-covered slope with **dark green (#006400)** foliage (foreground) and **medium green (#228B22)** (background).  \n- **Trees/Bushes**: Left side: A tall tree with a curved trunk (**brown (#8B4513)**) and **light green (#90EE90)** foliage. Right side: Dense **medium green (#228B22)** bushes.  \n- **Dirt Path**: Left foreground. Irregular polygon (tan (#D2B48C)) with **brown (#8B4513)** patches and **light green (#90EE90)** grass tufts (small circles, 0.1-inch diameter).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Foreground**: Giraffe’s neck (curved over the human’s shoulders) and body (right side). The giraffe’s head tilts downward to the human’s left shoulder.  \n- **Middle Ground**: Human (partially obscured by the giraffe’s neck). The human stands behind the giraffe’s neck, with arms wrapped slightly around it.  \n- **Background**: Hillside, trees, and sky. The dirt path leads from the foreground (left) into the distance, narrowing to create depth.  \n- **Layer Order**:  \n  1. Giraffe’s neck/head (frontmost)  \n  2. Human’s hands/arms (in front of giraffe’s body)  \n  3. Human’s torso/shawl (behind giraffe’s neck)  \n  4. Giraffe’s body/legs (behind human’s torso)  \n  5. Background hills/trees (behind all)  \n  6. Sky (backmost)  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The SVG must mimic the photograph’s realism through precise geometric details (giraffe spots, shawl patterns) and natural proportions.  \n- **Vector Precision**: All elements are defined as closed paths (polygons, rectangles, curves) with solid fills or gradients. No raster textures—textures are implied via patterns (e.g., shawl checkers, dress geometry).  \n- **Depth**: Created via:  \n  - **Color Gradients**: Sky (light to pale blue) and hillside (dark to medium green).  \n  - **Layer Hierarchy**: Foreground elements (giraffe, human) overlap background elements (hills, trees).  \n  - **Path Opacity**: Sky haze (low opacity) and grass tufts (subtle transparency) soften edges.  \n- **Folds/Texture**: Shawl and dress have curved edges to represent fabric folds. Giraffe’s mane is a series of small, upright lines to imply stiff hair.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**\n#### **Giraffe**  \n- **Neck**: Curved path (Bezier curve) with a width that increases from the head (1 unit) to the body (3 units). Fill: **white (#FFFFFF)**. Spots: 50–60 irregular polygons (**brown (#8B4513)**) with **white (#FFFFFF)** borders (0.05 units wide).  \n- **Mane**: 20–30 small triangles (0.5 units long) along the neck’s top edge. Fill: **brown (#A0522D)** with **black (#000000)** tips.  \n- **Head**: Oval (2 units wide, 1.5 units tall) with a pointed snout. Fill: **white (#FFFFFF)**. Spots: Smaller than the neck (15–20 polygons).  \n- **Ears**: Two triangles (0.75 units long) on top of the head. Fill: **gray (#D3D3D3)** with **black (#000000)** tips. Inner ear: **white (#FFFFFF)**.  \n\n#### **Human**  \n- **Shawl**: Two rectangles (1.5 units wide, 3 units long) draped over left/right shoulders. Fill: **red (#FF0000)** with **yellow (#FFD700)** checkers (1-unit squares with 0.05-unit yellow borders). Curved edges to represent folds.  \n- **Dress**: Rectangle (2 units wide, 2 units tall) with a **red (#FF0000)** fill. Apply a tileable pattern (dark red (#8B0000) diamonds) via SVG `pattern` element.  \n- **Bracelets**: Three rectangles (0.25 units wide, 1 unit long) on the wrist. Fills: **yellow (#FFD700)**, **red (#FF0000)**, **blue (#0000FF)**. Positioned sequentially (wrist to forearm).  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Hillside**: Closed path (curved top edge) with a **medium green (#228B22)** fill. Overlay with **dark green (#006400)** polygons (bushes) in the foreground.  \n- **Trees**: Left tree trunk: Curved path (**brown (#8B4513)**) with a width of 0.5 units. Foliage: 10–15 **light green (#90EE90)** polygons (irregular shapes) clustered at the top.  \n- **Dirt Path**: Irregular polygon (3 units wide, 4 units long) with **tan (#D2B48C)** fill. Add **brown (#8B4513)** patches (small polygons) and **light green (#90EE90)** circles (grass tufts) along the edges.  \n\n\n### **Proportions (Arbitrary Unit Scale)**\n- **Giraffe**:  \n  - Neck length: 10 units (curved)  \n  - Body height (legs to shoulders): 6 units  \n  - Head width: 1.5 units  \n- **Human**:  \n  - Torso height: 3 units (shoulders to waist)  \n  - Shawl length: 3 units (shoulders to waist)  \n  - Bracelet width: 0.25 units  \n- **Background**:  \n  - Sky height: 4 units  \n  - Hillside height: 3 units  \n  - Dirt path width: 3 units  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Creation**\nTo recreate the image accurately:  \n1. **Define all elements as closed vector paths** (polygons, curves, rectangles).  \n2. **Apply solid fills or gradients** (e.g., sky gradient, giraffe spot colors).  \n3. **Use patterns** for repetitive details (shawl checkers, dress geometry).  \n4. **Maintain layer hierarchy** (foreground = giraffe/human; background = hills/sky).  \n5. **Add subtle details** (giraffe mane lines, shawl folds, grass tufts) to enhance realism.  \n\nThis description provides the precision needed to translate the photograph into a faithful SVG, ensuring all visual and spatial characteristics are preserved.",
  "v1_111": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its elements, properties, and layout—focused on geometric precision, spatial relationships, and visual characteristics necessary for vector reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **zebra drinking from a shallow water hole**, surrounded by a rocky, arid environment. Key elements include:  \n- **Zebra**: The primary subject, standing on a sandy shore with front legs bent (posture for drinking) and head lowered to the water. Anatomy details:  \n  - **Body**: Torso (oblong, slightly curved), four legs (two front bent, two back straight), head (triangular with a tapered muzzle), upright mane (runs from forehead to shoulders), tail (curved, with a black tuft).  \n  - **Stripes**: Alternating black-and-white, following body contours (horizontal on torso, vertical on legs, diagonal on head/neck).  \n- **Water Hole**: Irregularly shaped, shallow body of water occupying the lower right third of the image.  \n- **Rocks**:  \n  - **Foreground**: Large, blurred boulders (bottom left) with irregular edges.  \n  - **Midground/Background**: Scattered smaller rocks (left of the zebra, right of the water hole) and gravel.  \n- **Fence**: Background structure (upper third) with **horizontal metal slats** (5–6) and a **chain-link section** (right side).  \n- **Vegetation**:  \n  - **Dry Twigs**: Thin, brown stems (left background, behind the zebra).  \n  - **Foreground Greenery**: Blurred, leafy shapes (bottom right, out of focus).  \n- **Text**: Repeated \"alamy\" watermarks (semi-transparent, white) across the image; bottom text includes \"alamy\" (left), \"Image ID: PPWORR\" (center-right), and \"www.alamy.com\" (right).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Zebra**:  \n  - **Stripes**: High-contrast black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF).  \n  - **Mane/Tail Tuft**: Solid black.  \n  - **Ears**: White inner lining, black outer.  \n  - **Hooves**: Solid black.  \n- **Water**:  \n  - **Surface**: Murky gray-brown (#A9A9A9 to #696969) with a gradient (lighter near shore, darker center) to simulate depth.  \n  - **Ripples**: Small, irregular white lines (low opacity) to show movement.  \n  - **Reflection**: Semi-transparent (#FFFFFF, 50% opacity) copy of the zebra’s head/neck, flipped vertically, with slight blur.  \n- **Rocks**:  \n  - **Foreground**: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with brownish tints (#8B4513) and gradient fills (light to dark) for texture.  \n  - **Background**: Pale gray (#E0E0E0) with less contrast.  \n- **Sand/Shore**: Pale tan (#F5DEB3) with subtle gravel texture (small gray dots, low opacity).  \n- **Fence**:  \n  - **Slats**: Dark brown (#4B3621) with a slight gradient (dark to black) for depth.  \n  - **Chain-Link**: Gray (#808080) with a diamond-pattern texture (simplified for SVG).  \n- **Vegetation**:  \n  - **Dry Twigs**: Brown (#8B4513).  \n  - **Foreground Greenery**: Blurred green (#2E8B57 to #32CD32) with low opacity (30%).  \n- **Text**:  \n  - **Watermarks**: White (#FFFFFF) with 50% opacity.  \n  - **Bottom Text**: White (#FFFFFF), bold for \"alamy\", regular for ID/URL.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Zebra**:  \n  - **Posture**: Standing on the sand shore, front legs bent (knees forward) to lower head to water.  \n  - **Position**: Middle-left of the image, with head centered horizontally and vertically aligned with the water’s edge.  \n  - **Scale**: Approximately 2/3 the image height (taller than foreground rocks).  \n- **Water Hole**:  \n  - **Shoreline**: Curves from the center-left (near the zebra’s front legs) to the right edge, separating sand from water.  \n  - **Reflection**: Positioned directly below the zebra’s head/neck, with the top of the reflection aligned with the water’s edge.  \n- **Rocks**:  \n  - **Foreground**: Overlap the water’s edge (bottom left), blurred to indicate depth of field.  \n  - **Background**: Scattered behind the zebra (left) and to the right of the water hole, smaller and less detailed.  \n- **Fence**:  \n  - **Position**: Upper third of the image, spanning the full width.  \n  - **Depth**: Behind all other elements (zebra, rocks, water).  \n- **Vegetation**:  \n  - **Dry Twigs**: Left background, behind the zebra, shorter than the fence.  \n  - **Foreground Greenery**: Bottom right, overlapping the water’s edge, blurred to indicate proximity.  \n- **Text**:  \n  - **Watermarks**: Spaced evenly in a grid (every 20% of image width/height).  \n  - **Bottom Text**: Aligned along the bottom edge, with \"alamy\" at left, ID at center-right, and URL at right.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The image is a photograph, so SVG reproduction requires precise geometric translation of natural forms (e.g., zebra stripes following body contours, irregular rock shapes).  \n- **Depth of Field**: Foreground (blurred rocks, greenery) and background (fence, distant rocks) are less detailed than the in-focus zebra and water.  \n- **Texture**:  \n  - **Zebra**: Smooth skin with distinct, crisp stripes.  \n  - **Water**: Rippled surface with subtle reflection distortion.  \n  - **Rocks**: Rough, uneven surfaces (simulated with gradient fills and irregular polygons).  \n  - **Fence**: Smooth slats vs. textured chain-link.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light (no harsh shadows), with water reflecting ambient light.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Watermarks**:  \n  - **\"alamy\"**: Repeated across the image in a sans-serif font, white, 50% opacity, sized to ~5% of image width.  \n- **Bottom Text**:  \n  - **\"alamy\"**: Bold sans-serif, white, ~10% of image height, positioned at bottom left.  \n  - **\"Image ID: PPWORR\"**: Regular sans-serif, white, ~5% of image height, centered-right.  \n  - **\"www.alamy.com\"**: Regular sans-serif, white, ~5% of image height, bottom right.  \n- **Zebra Details**:  \n  - **Ears**: Pointed, with white inner lining; positioned slightly back (not perked).  \n  - **Eyes**: Small black circles with a white highlight (10% of eye size) for reflection.  \n  - **Mouth**: Closed, just touching the water (small curved line).  \n  - **Tail**: Curved slightly, with a black tuft at the end (1/3 tail length).  \n- **Water Ripples**: Small, irregular lines (1–2 pixels wide) near the shore, oriented parallel to the shoreline.  \n- **Fence**:  \n  - **Slats**: 5 horizontal rectangles, each ~10% of image height, spaced evenly.  \n  - **Posts**: Vertical rectangles between slats (~5% of image width).  \n  - **Chain-Link**: Simplified to a grid of diagonal lines (1 pixel wide) forming diamonds (5% of image width).  \n- **Vegetation**:  \n  - **Dry Twigs**: Thin, curved lines (1–2 pixels wide) with small, triangular \"buds\" (optional).  \n  - **Foreground Greenery**: Blurred shapes (curved lines) with a gradient fill (light to dark green) and 30% opacity.\n\n\n### **Key SVG Reproduction Notes**\n- **Zebra Stripes**: Use clipping paths or masks to ensure stripes follow body contours (e.g., torso stripes are horizontal, leg stripes vertical).  \n- **Water Reflection**: Create a vertical flip of the zebra’s head/neck, apply 50% opacity, and add a Gaussian blur (σ = 1–2) to mimic ripples.  \n- **Rocks**: Use irregular polygons with gradient fills (light to dark gray) to simulate 3D; foreground rocks have more vertices (irregularity) than background rocks.  \n- **Fence Chain-Link**: Use a pattern element (diamond grid) to repeat across the chain-link section.  \n- **Depth of Field**: Apply Gaussian blur (σ = 3–5) to foreground rocks and greenery; reduce opacity (70–80%) for background elements.  \n- **Text**: Use `<text>` elements for watermarks and bottom text, with `opacity=\"0.5\"` for watermarks.\n\n\nThis description provides all necessary details for accurate SVG reproduction, including geometric precision, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic cues.",

Key spatial rules:\n\n- **People**:  \n  - The man is centered horizontally (`x=500`) and occupies the lower 2/3 of the image (`y=200`–`600`).  \n  - The woman is positioned **above and to the right** of the man: her head is at `(550, 250)` (above his shoulder), and her legs wrap around his waist (`y=400`–`500`).  \n- **Ocean**: Spans the midground (`y=400`–`550`), with waves at the top of the ocean (`y=400`).  \n- **Sand**: Occupies the bottom 1/12 of the image (`y=550`–`600`), with the man’s feet partially submerged.  \n- **Sky**: Takes up the top 2/3 of the image (`y=0`–`400`), with the sun in the upper right quadrant (`(550, 100)`).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe SVG style is **realistic but simplified**, prioritizing geometric clarity while retaining organic details (e.g., curls, wave foam). Key choices:  \n- **Gradients**: Used for the sky (atmospheric depth) and ocean (water volume).  \n- **Textured Paths**: Jagged lines for wave foam and irregular curves for the woman’s hair add tactile realism.  \n- **Layering**:  \n  1. Sky (bottom layer) → 2. Sun → 3. Ocean → 4. Waves → 5. Sand → 6. Man → 7. Woman (top layer, as she is on the man’s back).  \n- **Negative Space**: The sun’s glow and empty sky balance the busy foreground (people, waves).  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Accuracy**\n- **Hair Texture**: The woman’s curly hair is rendered as an **irregular oval** with 8–10 small, curved \"curl\" paths (1px, `#8D6E63`) inside the base shape.  \n- **Wave Foam**: The primary wave has 15–20 jagged \"teeth\" (10px tall) along its top edge, spaced 50px apart.  \n- **Sand Texture**: 10 horizontal lines (1px, `#E0C9A6`) spanning the sand rectangle, spaced 5px apart (30% opacity).  \n- **Facial Expressions**:  \n  - Man: Eyes at `(480, 320)` and `(520, 320)` (5px circles), mouth at `(500, 360)` (10px curved line, upward).  \n  - Woman: Eyes at `(530, 220)` and `(570, 220)` (5px circles), mouth at `(550, 260)` (12px curved line, upward).  \n- **Distant Horizon**: Subtle \"land\" or \"boats\" (optional) as small rectangles/ovals (`#666666`) at `y=150` (e.g., `(100, 150)` and `(200, 150)`).  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout**\nAssume a **1000px × 600px** canvas (common photo ratio). Key proportions:  \n- **Man**: Height = 400px (`y=200`–`600`), width = 150px (`x=425`–`575`).  \n- **Woman**: Height = 300px (`y=150`–`450`), width = 140px (`x=500`–`640`).  \n- **Sun**: 10% of canvas width (100px diameter) for visual balance.  \n- **Waves**: Primary wave height = 5% of canvas height (30px) to avoid overwhelming the foreground.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\nTo build the SVG:  \n1. **Layer Backgrounds**: Sky (gradient) → Sun (concentric circles) → Ocean (gradient) → Waves (jagged paths) → Sand (textured rectangle).  \n2. **Add People**: Man (torso + head + limbs) → Woman (hair + head + torso + limbs, positioned above/right of man).  \n3. **Refine Details**: Facial features, hair curls, wave foam, and sand texture.  \n4. **Adjust Opacity**: Use semi-transparency for the sun’s glow and wave foam to mimic light.  \n\nThis structure ensures the SVG retains the image’s emotional tone (joyful, warm) while being geometrically precise for reproduction.",
  "v1_113": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, technical description of its components, focusing on geometry, color, layout, and style. The image features **five kittens** in a grassy field, with a playful, realistic aesthetic and soft, even lighting.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe primary subjects are **five kittens** positioned in a loose line from left to right, with the fourth kitten (foreground) being the most prominent. The background is a **dense grassy field** extending to the horizon.\n\n#### **Kittens (Left to Right)**\nEach kitten has a rounded, fluffy body with proportional head, ears, and limbs. Key features:\n- **Kitten 1 (Leftmost: Orange Tabby)**:  \n  - Body: Oval (120px wide × 80px tall) with a slight taper at the waist.  \n  - Head: Smaller oval (80px wide × 60px tall) centered on the body.  \n  - Ears: Two triangular shapes (20px base × 30px height) with rounded tips, positioned atop the head (inner ears pink).  \n  - Eyes: Two circular pupils (10px radius) with blue irises, looking left.  \n  - Paws: Four small ovals (20px wide × 15px tall) at the bottom of the body (front paws together).  \n  - Whiskers: 10–12 thin, curved lines (30px long) extending from the nose.  \n\n- **Kitten 2 (Gray Tabby)**:  \n  - Body: Larger oval (140px wide × 90px tall) with a white chest and paws.  \n  - Head: Oval (90px wide × 70px tall) with distinct black stripes.  \n  - Ears: Triangular (25px base × 35px height) with pink inner lining.  \n  - Eyes: Circular (11px radius) with bright blue irises, looking forward.  \n  - Stripes: Horizontal black lines on the back/ sides; vertical stripes on the legs.  \n\n- **Kitten 3 (Small Gray Tabby)**:  \n  - Body: Compact oval (110px wide × 70px tall) – smallest of the group.  \n  - Head: Small oval (70px wide × 50px tall) with lighter gray stripes.  \n  - Ears: Triangular (20px base × 30px height) with pink inner ears.  \n  - Eyes: Circular (10px radius) with pale blue irises, looking forward.  \n  - Paws: White, positioned close together.  \n\n- **Kitten 4 (Foreground: Brown Tabby)**:  \n  - Body: Largest oval (150px wide × 100px tall) – most forward in the composition.  \n  - Head: Broad oval (100px wide × 80px tall) with bold vertical stripes on the face.  \n  - Ears: Triangular (25px base × 35px height) with pink inner lining.  \n  - Eyes: Rounded circles (12px radius) with deep blue irises, **looking downward** (pupils positioned lower in the eye).  \n  - Stripes: Thick black vertical stripes on the cheeks; horizontal stripes on the body/ legs.  \n  - Paws: Brown, positioned low (close to the bottom of the canvas) to emphasize crouching.  \n\n- **Kitten 5 (Rightmost: Light Brown Tabby)**:  \n  - Body: Oval (120px wide × 80px tall) – partially hidden behind Kitten 4.  \n  - Head: Oval (80px wide × 60px tall) with soft, light brown stripes.  \n  - Ears: Triangular (20px base × 30px height) with pink inner ears, slightly tilted backward.  \n  - Eyes: Circular (10px radius) with pale blue irises, **looking to the right**.  \n\n#### **Grass**\n- **Base Layer**: A solid rectangle covering the bottom ⅔ of the canvas (e.g., 800px wide × 400px tall), serving as the \"far grass.\"  \n- **Foreground Blades**: Hundreds of thin, pointed paths (50–150px long × 2–5px wide) representing individual grass blades. Blades vary in angle (10–30° from vertical) and length to mimic natural growth.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are vibrant but soft, with warm tones (orange) balanced by cool grays/browns. Textures are subtle, using gradients and stroke effects to mimic fur and grass.\n\n#### **Kittens**\n| Kitten | Body Color (Base) | Stripes/Markings | Paws/Chest | Eyes | Inner Ears | Nose | Whiskers |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------|------|------------|------|----------|\n| 1      | #FFA500 (Orange)  | None             | #FFA500    | #4682B4 (Blue) | #FFC0CB (Pink) | #FF69B4 (Pink) | #FFFFFF (White) |\n| 2      | #808080 (Gray)    | #000000 (Black, horizontal) | #FFFFFF (White) | #4682B4 | #FFC0CB | #FF69B4 | #FFFFFF |\n| 3      | #D3D3D3 (Light Gray) | #000000 (Thin, horizontal) | #FFFFFF | #4682B4 | #FFC0CB | #FF69B4 | #FFFFFF |\n| 4      | #8B4513 (Brown)   | #000000 (Thick, vertical/horizontal) | #8B4513 | #4169E1 (Dark Blue) | #FFC0CB | #FF69B4 | #FFFFFF |\n| 5      | #D2B48C (Tan)     | #A0522D (Soft, horizontal) | #D2B48C | #4682B4 | #FFC0CB | #FF69B4 | #FFFFFF |\n\n- **Fur Texture**: Subtle linear gradients (light → dark) on each kitten’s body to mimic volume. For example:  \n  - Kitten 1: #FFD700 (Light Orange, left) → #FFA500 (Dark Orange, right).  \n  - Kitten 4: #D2B48C (Light Brown, left) → #8B4513 (Dark Brown, right).  \n- **Eyes**: Each eye has a small white highlight (#FFFFFF, 2px radius) at the **top-right** to simulate light reflection.  \n- **Whiskers**: Thin lines (#FFFFFF) with a slight curve (quadratic Bezier) to mimic natural movement.  \n\n#### **Grass**\n- **Base Layer**: Linear gradient from #90EE90 (Light Green, top) → #2E8B57 (Dark Green, bottom) to create depth.  \n- **Foreground Blades**: Varying shades of green to add realism:  \n  - #66CDAA (Medium Green, mid-ground)  \n  - #32CD32 (Bright Green, close)  \n  - #2E8B57 (Dark Green, foreground)  \n\n#### **Shadows**\nEach kitten has a soft shadow (#000000, 0.15 opacity) beneath its body. Shadows are ovals (100–140px wide × 20px tall) positioned **5–10px below the paws** to mimic light from the front-left.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe canvas is assumed to be **800px wide × 600px tall** (wider than tall) for optimal composition. Kittens are centered horizontally, with the foreground kitten (4) dominating the lower third.\n\n#### **Kitten Layout (X/Y Coordinates, Top-Left Origin)**\n| Kitten | X Position | Y Position | Layer Order (1 = Bottom) | Notes |\n|--------|------------|------------|--------------------------|-------|\n| 1      | 150px      | 300px      | 2                        | Leftmost, slightly behind Kitten 2. |\n| 2      | 300px      | 280px      | 3                        | Standing, front paws apart. |\n| 3      | 450px      | 300px      | 3                        | Smallest, standing close to Kitten 2. |\n| 4      | 600px      | 320px      | 4                        | Foreground, crouching (lowest Y position). |\n| 5      | 750px      | 290px      | 3                        | Partially hidden behind Kitten 4. |\n\n#### **Grass Layers**\n- **Base Layer**: Covers the entire canvas (0px × 200px → 800px × 600px).  \n- **Foreground Blades**: Placed above the base layer, with longer blades (100–150px) at the bottom (Y = 400–600px) and shorter blades (50–100px) at the top (Y = 200–400px).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **cute, playful aesthetic** with a focus on the kittens’ expressions and fluffy fur. Key style elements:  \n- **Realism with Softness**: Kittens are proportionally accurate but rounded for a \"cute\" feel. Grass is detailed but not hyper-realistic.  \n- **Lighting**: Even front-left lighting creates subtle gradients (light → dark) on kitten bodies. Shadows are soft and low-opacity to avoid harsh contrasts.  \n- **Focal Point**: Kitten 4 (foreground) is the largest and lowest in the frame, drawing attention to its downward gaze.  \n- **Negative Space**: The grassy background provides context without distracting from the kittens.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text**: None.  \n- **Symbols**: None.  \n- **Key Details**:  \n  - **Whiskers**: 10–15 per kitten, curved outward (Bezier curves) to mimic natural movement. Kitten 4’s whiskers curve **downward** (matches downward gaze).  \n  - **Ears**: All ears have rounded tips. Kitten 5’s ears are slightly tilted backward.  \n  - **Stripes**: Tabby kittens (2,3,4,5) have stripes that follow body contours (e.g., Kitten 4’s facial stripes are vertical, body stripes horizontal).  \n  - **Grass Density**: Foreground grass (bottom ⅓ of canvas) is darker (#2E8B57) and more dense; background grass (top ⅔) is lighter (#90EE90) and less detailed.  \n\n\n### **6. SVG Technical Notes for Reproduction**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these guidelines for layers, paths, and effects:\n\n#### **Layers (Bottom to Top)**\n1. **Grass Base Layer**: Solid rectangle with linear gradient (#90EE90 → #2E8B57).  \n2. **Kitten Shadows**: Ovals (#000000, 0.15 opacity) below each kitten.  \n3. **Kittens**: Grouped by individual kitten (body → head → ears → eyes → nose → whiskers).  \n4. **Foreground Grass Blades**: Paths (#66CDAA, #32CD32, #2E8B57) placed above kittens to mimic depth.  \n\n#### **Paths and Shapes**\n- **Kittens**: Use `ellipse` for bodies/heads, `polygon` for ears (rounded tips via `rx`/`ry`), and `circle` for eyes/noses.  \n- **Grass Blades**: Use `path` with `d` attributes to create pointed, curved blades (e.g., `M 200 500 Q 210 400 220 350` for a curved blade).  \n- **Whiskers**: Use `path` with `stroke-width=\"1\"` and `stroke-linecap=\"round\"` for a natural look.  \n\n#### **Effects**\n- **Fur Fluff**: Add a subtle `feGaussianBlur` filter (σ = 1) to kitten edges to mimic soft fur.  \n- **Grass Texture**: Use `stroke-dasharray` (e.g., `5,2`) on a few blades to simulate worn tips.  \n- **Eye Highlights**: Small `circle` (#FFFFFF) at the top-right of each eye (2px radius) to add shine.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical Measurements**\n| Element | Measurement |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Canvas  | 800px × 600px |\n| Kitten 4 (Largest) | Body: 150px × 100px; Head: 100px × 80px |\n| Grass Blades (Foreground) | 100–150px long × 2–5px wide |\n| Eye Highlight | 2px radius |\n| Shadow Opacity | 0.15 |\n\nBy following this description, you can recreate the image as an SVG with accurate geometry, color, and style—capturing the playful charm of the kittens and the natural feel of the grassy field.",
  "v1_114": "To recreate this image as an **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics), a precise breakdown of objects, proportions, colors, and spatial relationships is critical. Below is a comprehensive, technical description organized by the user’s requirements, with a focus on **geometric details**, **layout**, and **reproducible elements**.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe scene is set on a **white rectangular desk** with silver angled legs, occupying the lower two-thirds of the image. Key foreground/background objects include:\n\n### Foreground (Focus)\n- **Left Open Pizza Box**: A standard corrugated cardboard box (tan) with a hinged lid raised at ~60° (back-hinged). The base holds a fully cooked pizza.\n- **Pizza**: Round, with a thick, irregular golden-brown crust (slightly overhanging the box edges). Toppings:  \n  - **Pepperoni**: Red, circular slices (10–12, distributed evenly).  \n  - **Ham**: Pink, rectangular slices (8–10, overlapping pepperoni).  \n  - **Black Olives**: Sliced, round (30–40, clustered in groups).  \n  - **Yellow Bell Peppers**: Thin, curved slices (15–20, scattered).  \n  - **Mushrooms**: Brown, sliced (10–15, under cheese).  \n  - **Cheese**: Melted, yellowish-orange with browned maillard spots.  \n- **Right Closed Pizza Box**: A taller, rectangular \"pan pizza\" box (tan) with a slightly raised lid. Labeled *regalpan.ro* (see **Text/Symbols**).  \n- **Two Coca-Cola \"Big\" Cans**: Red, cylindrical, standing upright between the pizza boxes and laptop.  \n- **Two Sauce Cups**: Small, round plastic cups (red = marinara, pink = ranch/garlic) between the left and right pizza boxes.  \n\n### Middle Ground (Slightly Blurred)\n- **Laptop**: Open, with a black keyboard, orange trim around the screen/base, and a blurred blue/white screen (icons/window visible).  \n- **Camera**: Compact black, lying on the desk behind the right soda can (with a wrist strap).  \n- **Notebook Stack**: Red-covered notebook with white pages, topped with a stack of white papers (red edges) and a small pen/sticker.  \n\n### Background (Blurred)\n- **Plants**:  \n  - **Spider Plant**: Long, green leaves in a white pot (right side of the desk).  \n  - **Orchid**: Pink flowers (3–4) on a tall stem in a white pot (behind the laptop).  \n- **Window**: Sheer white curtains (softly glowing from natural light) spanning the top third of the image.  \n\n\n## 2.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe desk is the **anchor** of the composition, with objects arranged in a **left-to-right hierarchy** (foreground to background):\n\n### Foreground (Left to Right)\n- **Left Pizza Box**: Occupies the **left 1/3** of the desk. The lid is raised at ~60°, with the base sitting flat. The pizza is centered in the base, with crust overhanging by ~1cm.  \n- **Sauce Cups**: Directly to the **right of the left pizza box** (red cup left, pink cup right). Each cup is ~2cm in diameter, spaced ~1cm apart.  \n- **Right Pizza Box**: Occupies the **right 1/3** of the desk. It is taller than the left box (~10cm height vs. 5cm) and positioned ~3cm to the right of the sauce cups.  \n- **Coca-Cola Cans**: Between the **left pizza box** and **laptop**. The left can is ~5cm from the left box; the right can is ~3cm from the right box. Both are ~12cm tall (standard can size).  \n\n### Middle Ground\n- **Laptop**: Behind the soda cans, occupying the **center back** of the desk. The screen is angled at ~30° from the desk, with the keyboard facing the viewer. The screen’s left edge aligns with the left soda can.  \n- **Camera**: Behind the right soda can, ~2cm from the right pizza box. It is ~5cm wide × 3cm tall, with a small lens (white circle) on the front.  \n- **Notebook Stack**: Behind the laptop, on the **right back** of the desk. The notebook is ~20cm × 15cm, with the paper stack (~5cm tall) on top.  \n\n### Background\n- **Plants**:  \n  - **Spider Plant**: Right side of the desk, behind the notebook. The pot is ~10cm in diameter, with leaves extending ~30cm to the right.  \n  - **Orchid**: Behind the laptop, left of the spider plant. The pot is ~8cm in diameter, with a stem ~40cm tall and pink flowers at the top.  \n- **Window/Curtains**: Top third of the image, spanning the width. Curtains are sheer, with a soft glow (SVG: use a pale yellow gradient overlay).  \n\n### Shadows (Critical for Depth)\n- **Left Pizza Box Lid**: Casts a soft shadow to the **left** of the box (SVG: use a translucent #808080 rectangle, rotated to match the lid angle).  \n- **Pizza**: Slight shadow on the **left inner edge** of the box (SVG: translucent #000000 rectangle, scaled to the pizza’s shape).  \n- **Coca-Cola Cans**: Small shadows to the **left** (SVG: tiny #808080 ovals, offset by ~1cm).  \n- **Laptop**: Shadow on the **back desk surface** (SVG: translucent #808080 rectangle, aligned with the laptop’s base).  \n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Photographic Realism**: The SVG must mimic the photo’s natural lighting and texture details (e.g., pizza crust char, cheese melt).  \n- **Depth of Field**: Foreground (pizza boxes, cans) is in focus; background (plants, window) is slightly blurred (SVG: use Gaussian blur on background elements, radius ~2–3px).  \n- **Lighting**: Natural light from the **right** (window), creating warm tones (e.g., pizza crust, cheese) and soft shadows. SVG: Add a pale yellow gradient to the right half of the image to simulate light.  \n- **Composition**: Balanced left-to-right (left box = right box, soda cans = camera/notebook). The pizza is the visual focal point (bright colors, central position).  \n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Text (SVG: Use sans-serif fonts, e.g., Arial)\n- **Pizza Boxes**:  \n  - **Side Panels**: Gray text (*regalpan.ro*) + crown logo (red, simple crown shape) + three phone numbers:  \n    `TEL: 0740 008 000 | 0730 005 000 | 0700 800 848`  \n    - **Left Box**: Text is on the **right side** of the base (visible when the lid is open).  \n    - **Right Box**: Text is on the **front side** of the box (visible when closed).  \n  - **Right Box Top**: Red partial logo (likely a stylized \"R\") + *regalpan.ro* (gray) + crown (red).  \n- **Coca-Cola Cans**: White text (*Coca-Cola*) + silver text (*Big*) (below the logo). The \"Big\" is in a bold, sans-serif font.  \n- **Laptop Screen**: Blurred, but visible are:  \n  - A **blue title bar** (top of the screen).  \n  - **Icons** (small, square, various colors) on the left.  \n  - A **window** (white background) with text (indistinct, but use gray placeholder lines).  \n\n### Symbols\n- **Crown Logo**: Used on both pizza boxes (next to *regalpan.ro*). Simple, stylized crown with three points (SVG: red, 5cm × 3cm).  \n- **Camera Lens**: Small white circle (1cm diameter) on the front of the camera.  \n- **Pizza Vent Holes**: Two small black circles (0.5cm diameter) on the **left side** of the left box’s base (ventilation).  \n\n### Specific Details\n- **Left Pizza Box Lid**: Hinged on the **back** (so the front edge is raised). The lid’s front edge is ~10cm from the base’s front edge.  \n- **Right Pizza Box**: The lid is slightly raised (not fully closed) – add a 1cm gap between the lid and base.  \n- **Sauce Cups**: The red cup has a **thicker rim** (SVG: stroke width 1px) than the pink cup (stroke width 0.5px) to simulate more sauce.  \n- **Notebook Paper**: The stack on top of the notebook has **red edges** (SVG: add a red border to the top/bottom of the paper rectangle).  \n- **Orchid Flowers**: Three pink flowers (5 petals each, yellow center) on the stem. Each flower is ~3cm in diameter.  \n\n\n## 6. Proportions and Layout (Critical for SVG Accuracy)\nUse the **left pizza box** as a reference (standard 12-inch pizza box: ~30cm × 30cm × 5cm):  \n- **Left Box Base**: 30cm × 30cm × 5cm (height).  \n- **Left Box Lid**: 30cm × 30cm (same as base), raised at 60° (so the top of the lid is ~20cm above the desk).  \n- **Pizza**: 28cm diameter (fits inside the box with 1cm crust overhang).  \n- **Right Box**: 30cm × 30cm × 10cm (taller than the left box).  \n- **Coca-Cola Cans**: 12cm tall × 6cm diameter (standard \"Big\" can size).  \n- **Sauce Cups**: 2cm diameter × 1.5cm tall (red cup) / 1.8cm diameter × 1.2cm tall (pink cup).  \n- **Laptop**: 35cm wide × 25cm deep × 3cm thick (screen: 30cm wide × 18cm tall).  \n- **Desk**: 150cm wide × 70cm deep × 75cm tall (standard desk size). The legs are 40cm tall, angled at 15° from the vertical.  \n\n\n## 7. SVG Recreation Checklist\nTo ensure accuracy, follow this step-by-step checklist:\n\n### 1. Draw the Desk\n- **Base**: White rectangle (150cm × 70cm).  \n- **Legs**: Four silver rectangles (5cm × 40cm), angled at 15° (two on the front, two on the back; only the front right leg is fully visible).  \n\n### 2. Draw the Left Pizza Box\n- **Base**: Tan rectangle (30cm × 30cm × 5cm). Add two black vent holes (0.5cm diameter) on the left side.  \n- **Lid**: Tan rectangle (30cm × 30cm), hinged on the back (rotate 60° from the base).  \n- **Text/Symbols**: Add *regalpan.ro* (gray, 3cm tall) + crown (red, 5cm × 3cm) + phone numbers (gray, 1.5cm tall) to the right side of the base.  \n\n### 3. Draw the Pizza\n- **Crust**: Golden-brown circle (28cm diameter) with irregular edges (use the \"pen tool\" to create bumps). Add dark brown char spots (1cm diameter) on the edges.  \n- **Cheese**: Yellowish-orange circle (26cm diameter) inside the crust. Add brown maillard spots (0.5cm diameter) randomly.  \n- **Toppings**:  \n  - Pepperoni: Red circles (3cm diameter) – 10–12, scattered.  \n  - Ham: Pink rectangles (4cm × 2cm) – 8–10, overlapping pepperoni.  \n  - Olives: Black circles (1cm diameter) – 30–40, clustered in groups.  \n  - Bell Peppers: Yellow curves (5cm × 1cm) – 15–20, scattered.  \n  - Mushrooms: Brown rectangles (3cm × 1cm) – 10–15, under cheese (use lower opacity).  \n\n### 4. Draw the Right Pizza Box\n- **Base**: Tan rectangle (30cm × 30cm × 10cm). Add *regalpan.ro* (gray) + crown (red) + phone numbers (gray) to the front side.  \n- **Lid**: Tan rectangle (30cm × 30cm), slightly raised (1cm gap from the base). Add a red partial logo (stylized \"R\") + *regalpan.ro* (gray) + crown (red) to the top.  \n\n### 5. Draw the Soda Cans\n- **Left Can**: Red cylinder (12cm tall × 6cm diameter). Add white *Coca-Cola* (5cm tall) + silver *Big* (2cm tall) to the front.  \n- **Right Can**: Same as left, but positioned 3cm from the right box.  \n\n### 6. Draw the Sauce Cups\n- **Red Cup**: Dark red circle (2cm diameter × 1.5cm tall) – 1cm from the left box.  \n- **Pink Cup**: Pale pink circle (1.8cm diameter × 1.2cm tall) – 1cm from the red cup.  \n\n### 7. Draw the Laptop\n- **Base**: Black rectangle (35cm × 25cm × 3cm) with an orange trim (1cm wide) around the edges.  \n- **Screen**: Black rectangle (30cm × 18cm) angled at 30° from the base. Add a blue title bar (1cm tall) at the top, and gray placeholder icons/text inside.  \n- **Keyboard**: Black rectangle (30cm × 10cm) on the base, with white key lines (0.5cm tall) (simplified, as individual keys are too small for SVG).  \n\n### 8. Draw the Camera\n- **Body**: Black rectangle (5cm × 3cm) – 2cm from the right can. Add a white circle (1cm diameter) (lens) to the front.  \n- **Strap**: Black line (0.5cm wide × 5cm long) – 1cm from the camera.  \n\n### 9. Draw the Notebook Stack\n- **Notebook**: Red rectangle (20cm × 15cm) – behind the laptop. Add white pages (1cm tall) to the bottom.  \n- **Paper Stack**: White rectangle (15cm × 10cm × 5cm) – on top of the notebook. Add a red border to the edges.  \n\n### 10.

Add dark green leaves (30cm long × 1cm wide) extending to the right.  \n- **Orchid**: White circle (8cm diameter) (pot) – behind the laptop. Add a green stem (40cm tall × 1cm wide) with three pink flowers (3cm diameter, 5 petals each, yellow center) at the top.  \n\n### 11. Draw the Window/Curtains\n- **Curtains**: Pale beige rectangle (150cm × 50cm) – top third of the image. Add a pale yellow gradient (translucent) to simulate light.  \n\n### 12. Add Shadows and Blur\n- **Foreground Shadows**: Use translucent #808080 rectangles/ovals for the pizza box lid, pizza, and soda cans.  \n- **Background Blur**: Apply Gaussian blur (radius 2–3px) to the plants, notebook, and window.  \n\n### 13. Final Adjustments\n- **Lighting**: Add a pale yellow gradient to the right half of the image (simulating window light).  \n- **Depth**: Ensure foreground objects (pizza, cans) are in front of middle ground (laptop, camera) and background (plants, window).  \n- **Scale**: Use the left pizza box (30cm × 30cm) as a reference to scale all other objects (e.g., the desk should be 5x the box width).  \n\n\n## 7. Final Notes for SVG Recreation\n- **Vector Tools**: Use Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape for precise shape drawing.  \n- **Gradients/Patterns**: Use linear/radial gradients for textures (e.g., cheese, soda cans) and patterns for cardboard (e.g., subtle lines).  \n- **Blur**: Use the Gaussian blur effect for background elements (plants, window) to mimic depth of field.  \n- **Text**: Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for all text, and ensure it matches the photo’s size/position.  \n\nBy following this detailed description, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s composition, colors, and details, suitable for scalable use.",

  "v1_116": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this coastal elephant scene, the following detailed breakdown of **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and technical specifications** is provided. The description prioritizes geometric precision, proportional consistency, and visual texture to ensure fidelity to the original image.\n\n\n## **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is a horizontal (wider than tall) natural scene centered on a **dark gray elephant** standing in shallow coastal water. Key elements include:  \n- **Elephant**: Focal point, with a bulky, rounded body, long curving trunk, large fan-like ears, and short tusks.  \n- **Ocean**: Upper 2/3 of the image, filled with dynamic waves (white crests, blue-green water).  \n- **Sand Beach**: Lower 1/3, a flat, curved band of tan sand.  \n- **Three Shorebirds**: Small, thin-bodied birds with long legs, positioned on the right side of the sand.  \n- **Sky**: Pale blue horizon line separating the ocean from a soft, hazy sky.  \n\n### **Elephant Anatomy (Proportional to Image Dimensions)**  \nLet the image have a **width = W** and **height = H** (e.g., 1000px × 600px for reference). The elephant’s proportions are:  \n- **Body**: Oval-shaped, 0.4W wide × 0.3H tall, centered at `(W/2, H/2)`.  \n- **Trunk**: Long (0.3H), tapering from the head to a rounded tip. Curves slightly downward, with the tip touching the shallow water.  \n- **Ears**: Wide, flat ovals (0.25W wide × 0.15H tall) attached to the top of the head, angled outward.  \n- **Tusks**: Short (0.05H), curved, and positioned on either side of the trunk (above the mouth).  \n- **Legs**: Thick, columnar, with the front legs slightly forward (walking posture).  \n\n- **Waves**: Multiple horizontal bands of water with **white foam crests** (closest to shore) and **blue-green water** (distance). The largest waves are in the middle ground, with smaller ripples near the elephant’s feet.  \n- **Sand**: A curved, flat plane at the bottom of the image, merging with the water at a jagged shoreline.  \n- **Shorebirds**: Three small, upright birds with:  \n  - Thin, elongated legs (2× body length).  \n  - Compact, oval bodies.  \n  - Pointed beaks (facing forward).  \n\n\n## **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \nAll colors are specified using **hex codes** for SVG consistency. Textures are described as **fill styles** (gradients, patterns) or **stroke details** (lines for wrinkles, veins).  \n\n### **Elephant**  \n- **Body**: Dark gray (`#333333`) with a subtle **brownish tint** (`#444444`) on the trunk and ears.  \n- **Trunk**: Rough texture simulated with **fine, parallel lines** (`#222222`, 0.5px stroke) running vertically along its length.  \n- **Ears**: Flat, with **vein details** (thin, branching lines `#555555`) and a slightly lighter edge (`#444444`).  \n- **Tusks**: Pale yellow-brown (`#B8860B`) with a matte finish (no gloss).  \n- **Eyes**: Small, dark circles (`#000000`) with a tiny white highlight (`#FFFFFF`).  \n\n### **Ocean**  \n- **Water**:  \n  - **Deep Distance**: Dark teal (`#2E8B57`) with a linear gradient fading to lighter teal (`#4682B4`) near the shore.  \n  - **Shallow Water**: Pale turquoise (`#87CEEB`) with 10% opacity to show sand beneath.  \n- **Foam**: Bright white (`#FFFFFF`) with a **dashed stroke** (`#EEEEEE`, 1px) to mimic froth. Larger waves have thicker foam bands (5–10px height).  \n- **Ripples**: Small, circular paths (`#FFFFFF`, 20% opacity) near the elephant’s feet and trunk to indicate movement.  \n\n### **Sand**  \n- **Base Color**: Warm golden tan (`#F4A460`) with a linear gradient fading to darker brown (`#D2691E`) at the edges (simulating shadow).  \n- **Texture**: Subtle granularity using a **noise pattern** (10% gray, 5px scale) or fine horizontal lines (`#E6982D`, 0.5px) to suggest sand grains.  \n- **Shoreline**: Jagged, irregular edge (no straight lines) where water meets sand.  \n\n### **Sky**  \n- **Gradient**: Pale blue (`#87CEEB`) at the top, fading to almost white (`#F0F8FF`) near the horizon (simulating atmospheric haze).  \n\n### **Shorebirds**  \n- **Body**: Mottled brown (`#8B4513`) with a lighter cream underbelly (`#F5DEB3`).  \n- **Legs**: Thin, dark gray (`#666666`) with no texture (smooth).  \n- **Beak**: Black (`#000000`), pointed.  \n\n\n## **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe layout follows a **rule of thirds** for balance, with the elephant as the focal point. Key coordinates (relative to image width `W` and height `H`):  \n\n| Element               | Position (x, y)                          | Size/Proportion                          |  \n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  \n| **Horizon Line**       | `y = H/3` (separates sky from ocean)     | Straight, full width (`W`).              |  \n| **Sand**               | `y = 2H/3` to `y = H` (lower third)      | Curved top edge (matches shoreline).     |  \n| **Elephant**           | Centered at `(W/2, H/2)`                 | Body height = 0.3H; trunk length = 0.3H. |  \n| **Elephant’s Ears**    | `(W/2 ± 0.15W, H/3.5)`                   | 0.25W wide × 0.15H tall.                 |  \n| **Tusks**              | `(W/2 ± 0.05W, H/3.7)`                   | 0.05H long, curved forward.              |  \n| **Largest Waves**      | `y = H/2` to `y = 2H/3`                  | Foam height = 0.05H.                     |  \n| **Shorebirds**         | `(0.7W, 0.85H)`, `(0.85W, 0.75H)`, `(0.92W, 0.73H)` | Body = 0.02W × 0.01H; legs = 0.02H long. |  \n\n### **Depth Cues**  \n- **Ocean**: Waves decrease in size and opacity as they recede (farther waves are smaller, lighter in color).  \n- **Sand**: Gradient from light tan (foreground) to dark tan (background) creates depth.  \n- **Elephant**: Shadow cast to the **right** (light source from the left) in the water (subtle black path `#000000`, 10% opacity) beneath its legs.  \n\n\n## **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \nThe image has a **realistic yet stylized** aesthetic, prioritizing:  \n- **Naturalism**: Accurate proportions for the elephant (trunk length, ear size) and birds (leg-to-body ratio).  \n- **Dynamic Movement**: Waves with irregular shapes (no重复的 patterns) and the elephant’s forward-leaning posture (front legs slightly bent) suggest motion.  \n- **Soft Lighting**: Warm, diffused sunlight (light source from the left) creates gentle highlights on the elephant’s left side and the sand.  \n- **Negative Space**: The sky and ocean provide breathing room, keeping the focus on the elephant.  \n\n### **SVG-Specific Style Notes**  \n- **Layers**: Organize elements in a logical stack (bottom to top):  \n  1. Sky (background)  \n  2. Ocean (water + foam)  \n  3. Sand  \n  4. Elephant (body > trunk > ears > tusks > eyes)  \n  5. Shorebirds  \n  6. Ripples (foreground water details)  \n- **Waves**: Use **贝塞尔曲线 (Bezier curves)** for natural, irregular crests (avoid straight lines).  \n- **Textures**: Simulate roughness (elephant skin, sand) with **subtle stroke patterns** (e.g., 0.5px lines for wrinkles) rather than high-resolution images (to keep SVG lightweight).  \n\n\n## **5. Specific Details and Symbols**  \n- **Elephant’s Trunk**: The tip is submerged in water, creating a small **splash** (1–2 white circles `#FFFFFF`, 5px diameter, 50% opacity).  \n- **Waves**: The closest foam bands to the shore are **thicker** (10px) and more irregular than distant waves (5px).  \n- **Sand**: Subtle **footprints** (light tan `#F4A460` paths, 10px diameter) near the elephant’s legs to indicate movement.  \n- **Birds**: Positioned in a **diagonal line** (from center-right to far-right) to create visual flow. Their legs are slightly bent, suggesting alertness.  \n- **Sky**: No clouds—just a smooth gradient to keep focus on the elephant and ocean.  \n\n\n## **Technical Specifications for SVG**  \nTo ensure scalability and accuracy, use the following guidelines:  \n- **Canvas Size**: Recommend `1200px × 800px` (3:2 aspect ratio) for a balanced composition.  \n- **Units**: Use **relative units** ( percentages or `vw`/`vh`) for responsiveness, but fix dimensions for consistency (e.g., `width=\"1200\" height=\"800\"`).  \n- **Stroke Widths**: Keep strokes thin (0.5–2px) to maintain detail at small sizes.  \n- **Gradients**: Define linear gradients for water, sand, and sky in the `<defs>` section for reuse.  \n- **Opacity**: Use low opacity (10–30%) for shadows (elephant, waves) and ripples to avoid harsh contrasts.  \n\n### **Example SVG Snippet (Elephant Trunk)**  \n```xml\n<defs>\n  <linearGradient id=\"trunkGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#333333\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#444444\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n</defs>\n\n<!-- Trunk -->\n<path d=\"M600 250 Q600 300 600 350 Q590 360 580 370\" \n      fill=\"url(#trunkGradient)\" \n      stroke=\"#222222\" \n      stroke-width=\"0.5\"/>\n```\n\n\n## **Summary**  \nThis description provides a **pixel-accurate blueprint** for recreating the image as an SVG. By following the geometric proportions, color palette, and texture guidelines, the final SVG will capture the essence of the original scene—from the elephant’s rough skin to the dynamic ocean waves—while remaining lightweight and scalable. The focus on **relative positioning** and **layer organization** ensures the composition retains its balance and focal point (the elephant) across all screen sizes.",

Proportions are relative to the **tallest building** (black-and-white high-rise, 100% height):  \n\n| Element | Relative Height | Position (X/Y) | Z-Index (Layer) |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Tallest Building (Black-and-White)** | 100% | Center-left (35% from left) | 5 (front of skyline) |\n| **Reddish-Brown Stepped Tower** | 60% | Left of tallest building (25% from left) | 5 |\n| **Blue-Glass High-Rise** | 80% | Right of center (65% from left) | 5 |\n| **Marriott Building** | 40% | Between stepped tower and red building (30% from left) | 5 |\n| **Construction Site** | 30% | Center-right (55% from left) | 5 |\n| **Residential Buildings** | 15% | Left (10% from left) | 4 (behind downtown) |\n| **Park** | 10% | Between dock and buildings (y = 70% from top) | 3 |\n| **Dock** | 5% | Along water’s edge (y = 85% from top) | 2 |\n| **Water** | 25% | Bottom (y = 75% from top) | 1 |\n| **Hills** | 20% | Left background (y = 50% from top) | 0 (behind all) |\n\n### Key Layout Rules:\n- **Skyline Balance**: Tallest buildings cluster in the **center-left**, with shorter buildings spreading to the right.  \n- **Park/ Dock**: The park is a **narrow strip** (10% height) between the dock (5% height) and downtown buildings.  \n- **Hills**: Confined to the **left background** (does not extend across the entire skyline).  \n- **Flag**: On the **white horizontal-window building** (right of the tallest building), top-right corner (z-index = 6).  \n- **Marriott Sign**: Centered at the top of the **white vertical-window building** (z-index = 6).  \n\n\n## **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe SVG style is **simplified realism** (geometric shapes, no photo textures). Key stylization choices:  \n- **Buildings**: Rectangles with flat roofs (except stepped tower and pyramidal roof). Windows are represented as **thin lines** (1% width) or **small rectangles** (for high-rises).  \n- **Trees**: Deciduous = rounded ovals (light green); evergreens = triangles (dark green).  \n- **Boats**: Minimalist (white rectangles + black triangles for masts).  \n- **Cranes**: Stylized (yellow rectangles for masts/arms, black hooks).  \n- **Sky/Water**: Gradients for depth (sky = top-to-bottom; water = light ripples on dark fill).  \n\n\n## **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThese elements are critical for accuracy and must be included:  \n\n### **Text**  \n- **Marriott Sign**: Red text (`#FF0000`) on the **white vertical-window building** (top center). Font: Arial, 5% of building height.  \n\n### **Symbols**  \n- **American Flag**: On the **white horizontal-window building** (right of the tallest building), top-right corner.  \n  - **Shape**: Rectangle (3:5 ratio) with 13 red/white stripes (top-to-bottom) and a blue field (top-left) with 50 white stars (small circles).  \n  - **Pole**: Thin brown line (`#8B4513`) extending from the building’s corner.  \n\n### **Construction Details**  \n- **Cranes**: Two yellow cranes (`#FFD700`) on the construction site:  \n  - **Left Crane**: Mast (vertical rectangle) + arm (horizontal rectangle) extending left.  \n  - **Right Crane**: Mast + arm extending right.  \n  - **Hooks**: Small black triangles at the end of each arm.  \n- **Scaffolding**: Brown lines (`#8B4513`) on the construction site (horizontal beams, 5% spacing).  \n\n### **Boat/Dock Details**  \n- **Boats**: 8–10 white rectangles (1:3 ratio) with black triangular masts (1.5x boat height). Evenly spaced along the dock (x = 5–95% from left).  \n- **Pilings**: Small brown rectangles (`#8B4513`) between each boat (10% of boat width).  \n\n### **Tree Placement**  \n- **Evergreen**: Tall conical shape (dark green) next to residential buildings (15% from left).  \n- **Deciduous**: 5–6 light green ovals scattered in the park (x = 20–80% from left, y = 75% from top).  \n\n\n## **6. SVG-Specific Notes**\nTo ensure accuracy in reproduction, follow these vector rules:  \n- **Gradients**: Use `<linearGradient>` for the sky (top-to-bottom) and water (subtle ripples as `<line>` elements with `opacity=\"0.3\"`).  \n- **Windows**: For high-rises, use `<line>` elements (1px stroke) or `<rect>` (1% width) spaced evenly.  \n- **Flag**: Use `<polygon>` for stripes and `<circle>` for stars (grouped under a `<g>` tag for rotation).  \n- **Cranes**: Group mast, arm, and hook into a single `<g>` tag for easy positioning.  \n- **Hills**: Use a `<path>` with a smooth curve (no sharp edges) to mimic natural terrain.  \n\n### Example SVG Code Snippet (Tallest Building):\n```svg\n<rect x=\"35%\" y=\"20%\" width=\"5%\" height=\"80%\" fill=\"url(#black-white-stripe)\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<linearGradient id=\"black-white-stripe\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"0\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#000000\"/>\n  <stop offset=\"10%\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n  <stop offset=\"20%\" stop-color=\"#000000\"/>\n  <!-- Repeat for 100% -->\n</linearGradient>\n```\n\n\n## **7. Final Checklist for SVG**\n- [ ] All buildings (including construction site) are represented as rectangles with correct proportions.  \n- [ ] Sky/water gradients are applied.  \n- [ ] Flag, Marriott sign, and cranes are included.  \n- [ ] Trees/boats are simplified to geometric shapes.  \n- [ ] Spatial relationships (z-index, positioning) are respected.  \n- [ ] Colors match the hex codes provided.  \n\nThis description provides all the **geometric, color, and layout details** needed to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. Adjustments for artistic style (e.g., more/less detail on windows) can be made, but the core structure remains consistent.",
  "v1_119": "To accurately recreate this pastoral farm scene as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of the image’s elements, including geometric properties, colors, spatial relationships, and artistic style. The description is organized to prioritize information critical for vector reproduction (e.g., path shapes, layer order, and texture模拟).\n\n\n## **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image depicts a calm farm scene centered on **sheep** (5 total), a **wooden feeding trough** with hay, a **green fence**, and **hay-covered ground**. Key elements are listed below with their core geometric shapes:\n\n### **Sheep** (5 total)\n- **2 Standing Sheep** (foreground, center-left to center):  \n  - **Body**: Large, vertically oriented oval (taller than wide) with a fluffy texture (simulated via overlapping small curves/ovals).  \n  - **Head**: Smaller oval attached to the top-front of the body, with a slightly pointed muzzle.  \n  - **Ears**: Two triangular shapes (pointed at the top) attached to the top of the head.  \n  - **Legs**: 4 rectangular limbs (rounded at the ends) attached to the bottom of the body; black, with subtle hooves (lighter black at the tips).  \n  - **Details**: One standing sheep (right) has a **small white oval forehead mark** (centered at the top of the head).  \n- **3 Lying Sheep** (background/right):  \n  - **Body**: Flattened, horizontally oriented ovals (curled into a resting position).  \n  - **Head**: Smaller oval tucked close to the body (not fully upright).  \n  - **Legs**: Tucked under the body (not visible in full).  \n\n### **Feeding Trough** (background, center)\n- **Frame**: Trapezoidal structure (top base longer than bottom) with a slanted front (angled ~30° from horizontal).  \n- **Slats**: 5–6 horizontal rectangular bars spanning the trapezoid’s front; evenly spaced (gap = 1/2 slat height).  \n- **Attachment**: Connected to vertical fence bars (see *Fence* below) via small wooden brackets (rectangles) at the top and bottom of the frame.  \n\n### **Fence** (background, behind trough)\n- **Vertical Bars**: 4–5 evenly spaced rectangular posts (taller than the trough) running vertically behind the trough.  \n- **Wall**: Solid rectangular panel (green) filling the space between/behind the bars; spans the upper 1/3–1/2 of the image.  \n\n### **Hay** (ground and trough)\n- **Ground Hay**: Layer of fibrous material covering the bottom 1/5 of the image; composed of hundreds of thin, curved bezier curves (varying lengths/directions).  \n- **Trough Hay**: Pile of hay inside the trough; denser on the left side, tapering to the right.  \n\n\n## **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified as hex codes for precision. Textures are described with vector-compatible methods (e.g., gradients, patterns).\n\n### **Sheep**\n- **Standing Sheep Wool**:  \n  - Base color: `#D9D6CE` (light gray with warm yellow undertone).  \n  - Texture: Subtle linear gradient (left: `#E0DDD5`; right: `#D2CFCA`) to simulate soft lighting.  \n  - **Black Features** (face, legs, ears): `#000000` (solid).  \n  - **White Forehead Mark** (right sheep): `#FFFFFF` (solid oval).  \n- **Lying Sheep Wool**:  \n  - Base color: `#B8B5AF` (darker gray than standing sheep).  \n  - Texture: Similar linear gradient (left: `#C0BDB7`; right: `#B0ADA7`) for depth.  \n\n### **Feeding Trough**\n- **Wood**:  \n  - Base color: `#8C6239` (warm brown).  \n  - Texture: Diagonal grain pattern (light: `#966A42`; dark: `#7C542D`) applied as a repeating pattern to the frame/slats.  \n- **Brackets**: `#7C542D` (darker brown, solid).  \n\n### **Fence**\n- **Vertical Bars**: `#228B22` (forest green, solid).  \n- **Wall**: `#1E7E34` (dark green, solid) with a subtle linear gradient (left: `#228B22`; right: `#1A6E2A`) for flatness.  \n\n### **Hay**\n- **Base Color**: `#F1E08A` (golden yellow).  \n- **Texture**:  \n  - Darker strands: `#D4AF37` (bronze) mixed into the pile to simulate fibrous texture.  \n  - Lighting: Linear gradient (left: `#F5E492`; right: `#E8D37F`) on individual strands for volume.  \n\n### **Shadows**\n- **Sheep**: Slightly transparent (`opacity: 50%`) gray ovals (`#808080`) under each sheep; size = 80% of body width × 20% of body height.  \n- **Trough**: Transparent (`opacity: 30%`) black rectangle (`#000000`) on the green wall; offset 5% to the right of the trough.  \n\n\n## **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe scene is organized in **3 depth layers** (foreground → middle ground → background) with clear overlapping and alignment. Coordinates assume a **1000×1000 unit canvas** (origin: bottom-left) for proportional consistency.\n\n### **Foreground** (Closest to Viewer)\n- **2 Standing Sheep**:  \n  - **Left Sheep**: Positioned at (350, 450) (x, y); body size = 150 (height) × 90 (width) units.  \n  - **Right Sheep**: Positioned at (600, 400); body size = 160 × 95 units (slightly larger to emphasize depth).  \n  - **Overlap**: Right sheep partially obscures the left sheep’s shoulder.  \n- **Ground Hay**: Covers y = 0–200 units (bottom 1/5 of the canvas).  \n\n### **Middle Ground** (Behind Foreground Sheep)\n- **3 Lying Sheep**:  \n  - **Center-Back Sheep**: Positioned at (450, 550); body size = 120 × 180 units (flattened).  \n  - **Right Sheep 1**: Positioned at (750, 500); body size = 110 × 170 units.  \n  - **Right Sheep 2**: Positioned at (850, 600); body size = 100 × 160 units.  \n  - **Overlap**: Standing sheep obscure the front edges of the lying sheep.  \n\n### **Background** (Furthest from Viewer)\n- **Feeding Trough**: Positioned at (250, 100) to (700, 400); frame size = 150 (top base) × 100 (bottom base) × 50 (height) units.  \n- **Fence**: Vertical bars span x = 200–750 units; height = 200 units (covers y = 100–300).  \n- **Green Wall**: Covers x = 0–1000, y = 100–500 units (behind the trough and fence).  \n\n### **Alignment**\n- **Trough**: Centered horizontally (x = 475–525 units); top edge aligns with the middle of the green wall.  \n- **Sheep**: All sheep face **toward the trough** (heads turned 10–15° to the right).  \n\n\n## **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: Detailed textures (wool fluff, wood grain, hay fibers) and soft lighting create a lifelike appearance.  \n- **Whimsy**: Slightly exaggerated sheep proportions (round bodies, small heads) add a gentle, approachable feel.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, cool-white light from the **left** (simulated via linear gradients on sheep, trough, and hay).  \n- **Mood**: Calm and pastoral, with balanced composition (sheep as focal point, trough as background anchor).  \n\n\n## **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**\n### **Sheep Wool Texture**\n- Use **grouped paths** (small ovals/curves) to simulate fluff. For example:  \n  - Create 50–100 small (`5×5` unit) ovals in sheep wool colors.  \n  - Distort and rotate the ovals to form a \"cloud\" shape matching the body outline.  \n  - Clip the group to the main body oval to maintain shape.  \n\n### **Hay Fibers**\n- Use **hundreds of thin bezier curves** (1–2 units wide) in hay colors.  \n- Vary curve direction (random angles) and length (10–30 units) to mimic natural hay.  \n- Group curves into \"clumps\" (10–20 curves per clump) to add density.  \n\n### **Wood Grain**\n- Create a **repeating pattern** of diagonal lines (light: `#966A42`; dark: `#7C542D`).  \n- Apply the pattern to the trough frame and slats using the `pattern` element in SVG.  \n\n### **Eyes and Facial Features**\n- **Eyes**: Small circles (`5×5` units) in `#000000`; add a `1×1` unit white circle (`#FFFFFF`) at the top-left for a highlight.  \n- **Nostrils**: Two `2×2` unit dots (`#000000`) below the eyes.  \n\n### **Fence Bars**\n- Vertical bars are **evenly spaced** (gap = 150 units for 4 bars on a 1000-unit canvas).  \n- Align the bars with the trough’s frame (e.g., left bar at x = 200, right bar at x = 750).  \n\n### **Proportions**\n- **Standing Sheep**: Body height = 1.5× body width (e.g., 150×90 units).  \n- **Trough**: Top base = 2× bottom base (e.g., 150×100 units).  \n- **White Forehead Mark**: 1/10 the size of the head (e.g., 10×8 units for a 100×80 unit head).  \n\n\n## **6. Layout and Balance**\n- **Focal Point**: The two standing sheep (center-left to center) draw the eye via their size and lighting.  \n- **Leading Lines**: The trough’s slants and fence bars guide the viewer’s gaze toward the sheep.  \n- **Negative Space**: The green wall and hay-covered ground create breathing room, preventing overcrowding.  \n\n\n## **Summary for SVG Workflow**\n1. **Layer Order** (bottom to top):  \n   Green wall → Fence bars → Trough → Lying sheep → Standing sheep → Ground hay → Trough hay → Shadows.  \n2. **Tools**: Use bezier curves for organic shapes (sheep, hay), rectangles/ovals for geometric elements (trough, fence), and patterns/gradients for texture.  \n3. **Precision**: Maintain consistent proportions (e.g., sheep body ratios) and align elements (e.g., trough with fence bars) to ensure realism.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as a faithful, detailed SVG—from the fluff of the sheep’s wool to the grain of the wooden trough.",
  "v1_120": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this modern office scene, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into geometric shapes, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic nuances. The focus is on precision for scalable vector graphics, including proportions, layering, and repeatable elements.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on **three people interacting around a rectangular office table** in a bright, modern workspace.

Hands on the table (one on a notebook, one on the laptop).  \n    - **Right woman (C)**: Sitting in a black chair, wearing a white blouse and dark pants. Hands on the laptop keyboard.  \n  - **Papers/Notebook**: Stack of white papers (left of the laptop) and a small notebook (under A’s pen).  \n\n- **Middle Ground**:  \n  - **Glass partitions**: Floor-to-ceiling rectangular panels (right of the people) with faint reflections of office furniture.  \n  - **Clock**: Large circular wall clock (left of center) with black numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) and hands.  \n\n- **Background**:  \n  - **Windows**: Large rectangular windows (upper right) with white frames, letting in natural light. Faint cityscape reflections.  \n  - **Plant**: Tall, leafy potted plant (right of the glass partitions) on a distant table.  \n  - **Chairs**: Partial views of black mesh chairs (left/right foreground) and distant office chairs (reflected in glass).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Colors (Hex Codes for SVG)**  \n- **People**:  \n  - Left woman (A): Light blue shirt (#E3F0FA), dark blue pants (#2A3B50), brown hair (#4A312D).  \n  - Man (B): Dark blue suit (#1A2E44), white shirt (#FFFFFF), brown hair (#3D2B27).  \n  - Right woman (C): White blouse (#FFFFFF), dark blue pants (#2A3B50), brown hair (#4A312D).  \n- **Table**: Glossy white (#F0F0F0) with a subtle gradient (lighter center, darker edges) for depth.  \n- **Laptop**: Matte white screen (#F8F8F8), gray keyboard (#D0D0D0), black keys (#000000).  \n- **Chairs**: Black mesh back (#000000) with perforated circles (#222222), black seat (#000000).  \n- **Clock**: White face (#FFFFFF), black numbers/hands (#000000).  \n- **Walls/Partitions**: Off-white walls (#F5F5F5), glass partitions (#E0E0E0) with a faint blue tint (#D6EAF8) from window light.  \n- **Windows**: Light gray (#E0E0E0) with subtle blue gradient (#D6EAF8) for sky reflection.  \n- **Plant**: Dark green leaves (#2E4A27), brown pot (#8B572A).  \n\n#### **Textures**  \n- **Mesh chairs**: Perforated (small 2mm circles) on the backrest for a breathable look.  \n- **Suit jacket**: Smooth with a slight sheen (subtle gradient from light to dark) to mimic fabric.  \n- **Shirts**: Cotton (matte, slight texture with 1mm lines for fabric weave).  \n- **Table**: Glossy (subtle reflection of the laptop and people, using a linear gradient from #FFFFFF to #E0E0E0).  \n- **Laptop**: Matte screen (flat color) and slightly glossy keyboard (subtle gradient from #D0D0D0 to #C0C0C0).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **balanced and centered**, with the table and laptop as the focal point. Key positioning:  \n\n#### **Foreground (Table and People)**  \n- **Table**: Rectangular, 1800mm (length) × 800mm (width) × 750mm (height). Occupies the lower 30% of the image (from y=60% to y=100%).  \n- **Laptop**: Centered on the table (x=50%, y=70%), 350mm (width) × 250mm (screen height) × 100mm (depth). Tilted 15° toward the viewer (screen top closer to the camera).  \n- **People**:  \n  - **Left woman (A)**: Sitting on the left edge of the table (x=20%, y=50%). Body turned 30° toward the center. Right hand (holding pen) over the notebook (x=35%, y=75%), left hand gesturing toward papers (x=25%, y=78%).  \n  - **Man (B)**: Standing behind the table (x=50%, y=45%), leaning forward. Hands on the laptop (right hand, x=55%, y=72%) and notebook (left hand, x=40%, y=75%).  \n  - **Right woman (C)**: Sitting on the right edge of the table (x=75%, y=50%). Body turned 20° toward the center. Hands on the laptop keyboard (x=65%, y=73%).  \n- **Papers**: Stack of 5 papers (x=30%, y=78%), 200mm × 300mm. Notebook (x=40%, y=76%), 150mm × 100mm.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground (Clock and Partitions)**  \n- **Clock**: Mounted on the back wall (x=25%, y=20%), 800mm in diameter. Hour hand between 10 and 11, minute hand between 2 and 3 (10:10, a common stock photo time).  \n- **Glass partitions**: 4 rectangular panels (x=60% to x=95%, y=10% to y=80%), each 1000mm wide × 2500mm tall. Spaced 50mm apart.  \n\n#### **Background (Windows and Plant)**  \n- **Windows**: 3 panels (x=70% to x=95%, y=10% to y=50%), each 1200mm wide × 1500mm tall. Faint cityscape (blurred rectangles) outside.  \n- **Plant**: On a distant table (x=90%, y=60%), 1000mm tall × 400mm wide.  \n\n#### **Proportions**  \n- **People**: 1700mm tall (realistic), but only upper bodies are visible (from waist up, ~800mm in the image).  \n- **Table**: 750mm tall (standard office height), 1800mm long × 800mm wide.  \n- **Laptop**: 350mm wide × 250mm screen height × 100mm depth (realistic 15-inch laptop).  \n- **Clock**: 800mm diameter (large, wall-mounted).  \n- **Windows**: 1200mm wide × 1500mm tall (floor-to-ceiling).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism with stylization**: The image is realistic (natural poses, lighting) but slightly stylized for a clean, modern look (muted tones, minimal clutter).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft natural light from the left (window) and right (windows) creates gentle shadows. The table has a subtle reflection of the laptop and people.  \n- **Composition**: Balanced (left/right women frame the man in the center). The laptop is the focal point, with all three people leaning toward it to emphasize interaction.  \n- **Shadows**: Soft and diffused (using Gaussian blur in SVG) under the table, behind the chairs, and on the walls. Shadows are 10% opacity (#000000) to avoid harshness.  \n- **Reflections**: Glass partitions reflect the back of the man’s head and the right woman’s shoulder (faint, 30% opacity) and distant office elements (chairs, plant).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Watermarks**: \"freepik\" repeated diagonally (top-left to bottom-right) in light gray (#CCCCCC) with 10% opacity. These are typically removed for SVG, but if included, they are 20mm tall, sans-serif font.  \n- **Clock**: Stylized sans-serif numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) with no minute markers. Hour hand (15mm wide × 80mm long), minute hand (10mm wide × 120mm long).  \n- **Pen**: Black, 150mm long, held in the left woman’s right hand (fingers wrapped around the barrel, tip pointing down to the notebook).  \n- **Notebook**: Small (150mm × 100mm), with a black cover (visible edge) under the left woman’s pen.  \n- **Papers**: Stack of 5 white papers (200mm × 300mm) with faint blue lines (1mm) for text (blurred, 5% opacity).  \n- **Suit pin**: Small (5mm) gold pin on the man’s left lapel (faint, 10% opacity).  \n- **Blouse details**: Right woman’s blouse has a loose fit, collar open (two buttons undone), and sleeves slightly rolled (to the elbow).  \n\n\n### **SVG-Specific Notes for Reproduction**\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into layers (foreground, middle ground, background) for easy editing.  \n- **Gradients**: Use linear gradients for glossy surfaces (table, suit jacket) and radial gradients for mesh chair perforations.  \n- **Shadows**: Use `<filter>` with Gaussian blur for soft shadows (e.g., `<filter id=\"shadow\"><feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceAlpha\" stdDeviation=\"5\"/></filter>`).  \n- **Reflections**: Use `<mask>` or `<image>` with opacity for glass partition reflections (e.g., 30% opacity of the man’s head behind the glass).  \n- **Textures**: Use `<pattern>` for mesh chair perforations (repeat 2mm circles) and shirt fabric (repeat 1mm lines).  \n- **Poses**: Use Bézier curves for natural hand gestures (e.g., left woman’s left hand is open, fingers slightly spread; right woman’s hands are curved over the laptop keyboard).  \n\nThis detailed description provides all the necessary information to recreate the image as an accurate, scalable SVG, including geometric shapes, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic nuances.",

The focus is on **geometric accuracy**, **realistic textures**, and **lived-in details** to match the casual, realistic style of the original photograph.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **used red plate** with a fork and food residue, resting on a **rough wooden surface**. Background elements include a partial blue object and additional wooden debris. Key shapes:  \n- **Red Plate**: A shallow, circular ceramic plate with a thin, raised rim (≈0.1 units thick). Occupies the **central 60%** of the image (viewBox: `0 0 100 100` for scalability).  \n- **Silver Fork**: A 4-tined stainless steel fork placed **diagonally** across the plate (tines on the left, handle extending to the right). Tines are rectangular (≈20% of the fork’s length) with pointed tips; the handle is a long rectangle with a curved end.  \n- **Food Remnants**: Irregularly shaped crumbs and specks:  \n  - **Long, thin crumbs** (e.g., rice noodles): 5–10 pieces, 0.5–2 units long, 0.1–0.2 units wide.  \n  - **Small round specks** (e.g., pepper, breadcrumbs): 15–20 pieces, 0.1–0.3 units in diameter.  \n- **Wooden Surface**: A large, flat piece of wood with rough, organic edges (covers the bottom 70% of the image). Includes a **prominent knot** (circular, ≈10 units diameter) on the left side.  \n- **Background Elements**:  \n  - **Blue Object**: A partial, rectangular/curved object (e.g., a bucket) on the **far left edge** (≈15% of the image width).  \n  - **Wooden Debris**: Small, irregular wooden pieces behind the main surface (darker brown, less detailed).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is warm and earthy, with subtle variations to mimic wear and natural materials. Textures emphasize **casual use** (smudges on the plate, scratches on the fork) and **organic roughness** (wood grain, crumbs).  \n\n| Object               | Color Palette                                  | Texture Details                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Red Plate**        | Deep maroon (#8b2323) with a lighter red (#e03e3e) for smudges. Rim is darker maroon (#5b1717). | Matte finish with **streaky smudges** (linear gradients) and **food residue** (small, irregular paths). Rim is slightly raised (subtle shadow). |\n| **Silver Fork**      | Metallic silver (#c0c0c0) with darker gray (#808080) for scratches. Handle has a subtle decorative pattern (e.g., parallel lines). | Matte stainless steel with **fine scratches** (path elements) and a **metallic sheen** (radial gradient: light silver on the left, dark silver on the right). Handle end is curved. |\n| **Wooden Surface**   | Varied browns: light tan (#d2b48c) to dark walnut (#4d2f2f). Knots are dark brown (#2f1a1a) with a light tan ring. | Rough, textured grain (**wavy path elements** in dark brown) and **knots** (radial gradients: dark center, light edge). Edges are irregular (no sharp lines). |\n| **Food Remnants**    | Crumbs: light beige (#f5deb3); specks: dark brown (#654321) or black (#000000). | Dry, irregular shapes (no smooth edges). Crumbs are slightly raised (subtle shadow). |\n| **Blue Object**      | Pale blue (#add8e6) with a matte finish.       | Solid color (no texture) to keep focus on the foreground. Partially cropped.    |\n| **Shadows**          | Fork shadow: gray (#333333); plate shadow: dark brown (#4d2f2f). | Soft, diffused edges (blur filter: `stdDeviation=\"1–2\"`). Opacity: 0.2–0.3.     |\n| **Highlights**       | Plate/fork: white (#ffffff) with low opacity (0.2–0.3). | Subtle reflections from top-left light (linear/radial gradients).                |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **casual and unstructured**, with the plate as the focal point. Use the **viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"** (100 units wide × 100 units tall) for scalability. Key positions:  \n\n| Object               | Position (ViewBox Coordinates)                 | Spatial Notes                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Red Plate**        | Centered at (50, 50) (x, y), diameter = 60 units. | Rests **flat** on the wooden surface. Rim extends 0.1 units beyond the plate’s base. |\n| **Silver Fork**      | Diagonal from (25, 60) (tines) to (85, 40) (handle end). | Tines are **1/3 of the fork’s length** (≈20 units); handle is **2/3** (≈40 units). Handle extends **15% beyond the plate’s right edge**. |\n| **Wooden Surface**   | Covers y=30 to y=100 (bottom 70% of the image). | Main piece is a rough polygon from (0, 30) to (100, 30) to (100, 100) to (0, 100). Edges are irregular (no straight lines). |\n| **Blue Object**      | Left edge: x=0 to x=15, y=0 to y=40.           | Curved top edge (use `Q` or `C` commands for smoothness). Partially hidden by the wooden surface. |\n| **Food Remnants**    | Concentrated near the **fork tines** (left side of the plate) and **plate center**. | Random distribution: 60% of crumbs/specks within 20 units of the fork’s tines. |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **realistic, documentary style** with a focus on **everyday imperfection**. Key artistic choices:  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the **top-left** creates subtle highlights (left side of the plate/fork) and shadows (right side). Mimic this with **linear/radial gradients** (light on left, dark on right).  \n- **Wear and Tear**: The plate has smudges (streaky gradients) and food residue (irregular paths); the fork has scratches (thin gray paths) and a worn handle (subtle texture).  \n- **Depth**: The wooden surface is the **middle ground**, with the plate/fork as the **foreground** and the blue object/wooden debris as the **background**. Use **opacity** (e.g., 0.8 for the blue object) to create layering.  \n- **Casual Composition**: The fork is askew (diagonal placement), and the plate is not perfectly centered—adds a \"lived-in\" feel.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nSubtle details are critical to replicating the image’s authenticity. Include:  \n- **Shutterstock Watermark**: A text element at the **bottom center** (y=95) with the text: `shutterstock.com 2040080033`. Use **Arial** (font-size: 3 units), white (#ffffff), and 0.7 opacity.  \n- **Fork Handle Pattern**: A small decorative element (e.g., parallel lines or a \"U\" shape) near the tines (x=30, y=60). Use dark gray (#808080), 0.1 units thick.  \n- **Plate Rim**: A thin, raised edge (≈0.1 units) around the plate. Use a **darker maroon** (#5b1717) and a subtle shadow (0.1 units offset, 0.2 opacity) to simulate depth.  \n- **Wood Knot**: A circular knot on the left side of the wooden surface (x=15, y=60, diameter=10 units). Use a **radial gradient** (dark brown center #2f1a1a, light tan edge #d2b48c) to mimic texture.  \n- **Scratches on Fork**: Thin, irregular gray paths (#808080) on the fork’s handle and tines. Place 5–10 scratches (0.5–2 units long) for a worn look.  \n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Technical Notes**\nTo replicate realistic textures and lighting in SVG, use these vector tools:  \n- **Gradients**: Linear gradients for the plate’s smudges (light red → dark red) and radial gradients for the fork’s metallic sheen (white → gray).  \n- **Filters**:  \n  - **Blur**: For shadows (stdDeviation=1–2) and soft highlights (stdDeviation=0.5–1).  \n  - **Noise**: For the plate’s matte finish (subtle grain) and wood texture (use a `feTurbulence` filter with `type=\"fractalNoise\"`).  \n- **Path Elements**:  \n  - Use `d` attributes with `M` (move), `L` (line), `Q` (quadratic curve), and `C` (cubic curve) to create irregular shapes (e.g., wood edges, crumbs).  \n  - For the wooden grain, draw 10–15 wavy paths (0.1 units thick) across the surface (use `random()` functions for natural variation).  \n- **Opacity**: Use 0.3–0.8 opacity for background elements (blue object, wooden debris) to create depth.  \n\n\n### **Example SVG Code Snippets**\nFor reference, here are simplified SVG snippets for key elements:  \n\n#### **Red Plate with Rim and Smudges**\n```svg\n<circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"30\" fill=\"url(#plateGradient)\" stroke=\"#5b1717\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<defs>\n  <linearGradient id=\"plateGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"0\">\n    <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#e03e3e\"/> <!-- Light red (left) -->\n    <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#8b2323\"/> <!-- Dark red (right) -->\n  </linearGradient>\n  <!-- Smudge (example) -->\n  <rect x=\"35\" y=\"45\" width=\"10\" height=\"5\" fill=\"#e03e3e\" opacity=\"0.5\" filter=\"url(#blur)\"/>\n</defs>\n```\n\n#### **Silver Fork with Scratches**\n```svg\n<!-- Tines -->\n<rect x=\"25\" y=\"60\" width=\"20\" height=\"1\" fill=\"url(#forkGradient)\"/>\n<rect x=\"27\" y=\"60\" width=\"20\" height=\"1\" fill=\"url(#forkGradient)\"/>\n<rect x=\"29\" y=\"60\" width=\"20\" height=\"1\" fill=\"url(#forkGradient)\"/>\n<rect x=\"31\" y=\"60\" width=\"20\" height=\"1\" fill=\"url(#forkGradient)\"/>\n<!-- Handle -->\n<path d=\"M45 60 Q50 55 85 40\" stroke=\"#c0c0c0\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"url(#forkGradient)\"/>\n<!-- Scratch (example) -->\n<line x1=\"50\" y1=\"55\" x2=\"55\" y2=\"57\" stroke=\"#808080\" stroke-width=\"0.1\"/>\n<defs>\n  <radialGradient id=\"forkGradient\" cx=\"0.2\" cy=\"0.5\" r=\"0.8\">\n    <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#ffffff\"/> <!-- Highlight (left) -->\n    <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#808080\"/> <!-- Dark gray (right) -->\n  </radialGradient>\n</defs>\n```\n\n#### **Wooden Surface with Knot**\n```svg\n<!-- Main wood piece -->\n<polygon points=\"0 30, 100 30, 100 100, 0 100\" fill=\"url(#woodGradient)\"/>\n<!-- Knot -->\n<circle cx=\"15\" cy=\"60\" r=\"5\" fill=\"url(#knotGradient)\"/>\n<!-- Grain (example) -->\n<path d=\"M0 40 Q20 45 40 42 Q60 38 80 45 Q100 50 100 50\" stroke=\"#4d2f2f\" stroke-width=\"0.1\" fill=\"none\"/>\n<defs>\n  <linearGradient id=\"woodGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#d2b48c\"/> <!-- Light tan (top) -->\n    <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#4d2f2f\"/> <!-- Dark walnut (bottom) -->\n  </linearGradient>\n  <radialGradient id=\"knotGradient\" cx=\"0.5\" cy=\"0.5\" r=\"0.5\">\n    <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#2f1a1a\"/> <!-- Dark center -->\n    <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#d2b48c\"/> <!-- Light edge -->\n  </radialGradient>\n</defs>\n```\n\n\n### **Final Notes for SVG Recreation**\n- **Layer Order**: Use the following stacking (top to bottom) for depth:  \n  1. Fork (with shadow)  \n  2. Plate (with shadow)  \n  3. Food remnants  \n  4. Wooden surface (with grain/knot)  \n  5. Blue object/wooden debris  \n  6. Watermark  \n- **Scalability**: Use the `viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"` to ensure the SVG scales without distortion.  \n- **Textures**: Combine gradients, filters, and path elements to mimic real-world materials (e.g., use `feTurbulence` for the plate’s matte finish).  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the original image’s casual realism, with all elements scalable and editable for future adjustments.",

Its front legs rest on the gray rug, and its back legs are on the wood floor.  \n\n### **Desk Accessories (Top View, Left to Right)**  \n| Accessory       | Position (Relative to Desk) | Alignment               |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Cup + Saucer    | Left third, front           | Centered on the left    |\n| Lamp            | Left third, rear            | Base against the left edge |\n| Laptop          | Middle third, rear          | Screen tilted toward the user |\n| Notebook + Pen  | Middle-right, front         | Notebook parallel to desk edges; pen lying horizontally on top |\n| Radio           | Right third, rear           | Back against the right wall; handle facing upward |\n\n### **Floor/Rug**  \n- The **herringbone wood floor** covers the entire room, with planks aligned at 45° to the walls.  \n- The **gray rug** is placed such that its left edge is parallel to the desk’s front edge, and its front edge extends 30cm beyond the chair’s position.  \n\n### **Lighting & Shadows**  \n- **Key Light**: Soft, cool white light filters through the left window (curtains), casting gentle shadows to the **right** of objects.  \n- **Shadows**:  \n  - **Desk**: A rectangular shadow (soft edges) on the right wall, matching the desk’s shape.  \n  - **Lamp**: A small oval shadow (10cm × 5cm) to the right of its base.  \n  - **Radio**: A rectangular shadow (20cm × 10cm) to the left of its body (against the wall).  \n  - **Laptop**: A narrow rectangular shadow (30cm × 5cm) to the right of the screen.  \n  - **Chair**: A irregular shadow (0.8m × 0.5m) on the rug, extending toward the desk.  \n\n\n## **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \nThe image follows a **modern minimalist aesthetic** with:  \n- **Clean Lines**: Straight edges (desk, laptop, radio) and curved forms (chair, lamp shade) balance rigidity and softness.  \n- **Neutral Palette**: Warm tones (wood, curtain) are offset by cool neutrals (gray rug, white chair) for a calming vibe.  \n- **Functional Design**: The desk (folding legs), chair (ergonomic shape), and lamp (adjustable arm) prioritize utility.  \n- **Subtle Contrast**: Dark desk top vs. light walls, matte metal vs. wooden textures, and glossy vs. matte surfaces create visual interest without clutter.  \n- **Soft Lighting**: Diffused natural light reduces harsh shadows, giving the scene a cozy, inviting feel.  \n\n\n## **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n- **Radio Brand**: The word \"Marshall\" is printed in **white serif font** on the radio’s metal grille, centered horizontally.  \n- **Planter Tube**: Clear plastic with **white polka dots** (1cm diameter) spaced 2cm apart in a grid pattern.  \n- **Laptop Keyboard**: Black keys (standard QWERTY layout) are visible, but no text is legible.  \n- **Notebook**: A small elastic band (brown) is implied on the cover (common in leather notebooks) but not explicitly visible.  \n- **Curtain Rod**: Not visible, but the curtains hang straight, suggesting a rod mounted at the top of the left wall.  \n- **Baseboards**: A 10cm tall white baseboard runs along both walls, meeting at the corner.  \n\n\n## **SVG-Specific Notes for Reproduction**  \nTo ensure accuracy in vector format, focus on:  \n- **Geometric Precision**: Use exact shapes (e.g., rectangles for desk legs, circles for lamp bases) and align objects to a grid (e.g., desk edges parallel to walls).  \n- **Patterns**:  \n  - **Wood Floor**: Create a herringbone pattern using repeating rectangles (rotate 45°) with a wood grain texture.  \n  - **Radio Grille**: Use a grid of small circles (1mm diameter) for the perforations.  \n  - **Planter Tube**: Draw a grid of white circles (1cm diameter) on a clear rectangle.  \n- **Shadows**: Use semi-transparent rectangles/circles with soft edges (blur effect) to replicate natural shadow diffusion.  \n- **Text**: The \"Marshall\" logo on the radio should be a vector text object (not raster) for scalability.  \n- **Proportions**: Maintain the following ratios (based on real-world measurements):  \n  - Desk: 1.5m (width) × 0.7m (depth) × 0.75m (height).  \n  - Chair: 0.5m (width) × 0.4m (depth) × 0.8m (height).  \n  - Radio: 0.25m (width) × 0.15m (height) × 0.1m (depth).  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, style, and functional elements.",
  "v1_123": "To recreate this image as an **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics), we need a precise breakdown of its composition, elements, textures, and spatial relationships. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requirements, with a focus on geometric accuracy, proportionality, and stylistic details.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image is a **top-down \"cozy scene\"** centered on a bed with dark blue bedding. The focal point is a ginger cat interacting with an open book, surrounded by comfort objects (pillows, a tray of snacks, a blanket). Key elements include:\n\n### Primary Focal Points\n- **Ginger Cat**: A long-haired (fluffy) cat lying on its left side, front paws extended toward an open book. The cat’s head tilts upward, with eyes fixed on the viewer.\n- **Open Book**: Positioned horizontally above the cat, with pages spread flat. A small lavender sprig serves as a bookmark, sticking out from the spine.\n- **Gray Tray**: A rectangular serving tray to the right of the book, holding a coffee cup, cookies, a lit candle, a honey jar, and lavender sprigs.\n\n### Secondary Elements\n- **Pillows**: \n  - **Mustard Yellow Velvet Pillow**: Large, trapezoidal (rounded edges) in the **top-left** corner, with a row of **3 gold pom-poms** along its top edge.\n  - **Dark Blue Pillow**: Smaller, rectangular (rounded edges) adjacent to the yellow pillow (top-center).\n  - **Gray Knitted Pillow**: Tall, rectangular (rounded edges) in the **top-right** corner, with a **cable-knit pattern** and **2 wooden buttons** (right side).\n- **Herringbone Blanket**: Folded under the cat’s lower body (bottom-left), with a black-and-white herringbone pattern and white tassels on the edges.\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nThe palette balances **dark, muted blues** (bedding) with **warm, inviting tones** (yellow, orange, brown) to create a cozy, contrast-rich composition.

Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe image has a **warm, cozy, and whimsical style** with a focus on:\n- **Contrast**: Dark blue bedding (cool) balances warm tones (yellow, orange, brown) to draw attention to the cat and book.\n- **Texture Variety**: Velvet, knit, fur, and paper textures create tactile depth.\n- **Top-Down Perspective**: Allows clear visibility of every element; the cat’s upward gaze adds a playful, intimate feel.\n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light (simulated via gradients) highlights the cat, book, and tray, while the bedding remains muted.\n- **Negative Space**: The dark blue bedding acts as a \"canvas\" to frame the focal points (cat, book, tray).\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Book Text**: Dense, small print (placeholder text for SVG; use a sans-serif font like `Arial` at 8px).\n- **Lavender Bookmark**: A small bunch of lavender (3–4 stems) sticking out from the book’s spine (center).\n- **Cat Whiskers**: 10–12 long, white whiskers (50px) extending from the nose; slightly curved.\n- **Pom-Poms (Yellow Pillow)**: 3 gold pom-poms (20px diameter) evenly spaced along the top edge (100px apart).\n- **Buttons (Gray Pillow)**: 2 round, wooden buttons (30px diameter) on the right side (top and middle); light brown (`#D4AF37`).\n- **Candle Flame**: A small, triangular flame (`#FF5733` red-orange) at the top of the candle (optional for SVG; can be omitted for simplicity).\n- **Tray Edges**: Slightly raised (5px) to hold items; subtle vertical lines (wood grain) across the surface.\n\n\n## 6. SVG-Specific Notes\nTo ensure accuracy in reproduction:\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into layers (e.g., `Bedding`, `Pillows`, `Cat`, `Book`, `Tray`, `Details`).\n- **Patterns**: Use SVG `<pattern>` elements for textures (knit, herringbone, fur).\n- **Gradients**: Use `<linearGradient>` or `<radialGradient>` for velvet, fur, and candle shine.\n- **Clipping Paths**: Use clipping paths to trim elements (e.g., the cat’s fur overlapping the book).\n- **Responsiveness**: Ensure all elements are scalable (avoid fixed pixel sizes; use percentages or viewbox).\n\n\n## Summary of Key SVG Requirements\n| Category               | Key Requirements                                  |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| **Focal Points**       | Cat (fluffy fur, upward gaze), open book (lavender bookmark), tray (coffee/cookies). |\n| **Textures**           | Velvet (gradient), knit (pattern), fur (lines), herringbone (pattern). |\n| **Colors**             | Dark blue bedding, warm accents (yellow, orange, brown). |\n| **Positioning**        | Top-down layout with balanced spacing; cat/book at center, tray to the right. |\n| **Details**            | Pom-poms, buttons, lavender, tassels, cookie chips. |\n\nBy following this description, you can recreate a faithful SVG version of the image with accurate proportions, textures, and stylistic details.",

Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe style is **minimalist and realistic** with a focus on:\n- **Balance**: Napkin/utensils (left) and glass (right) frame the plate.\n- **Naturalism**: Irregular food shapes (e.g., uneven green beans, fluffy potatoes) and soft shadows avoid \"perfect\" symmetry.\n- **Texture Hierarchy**: Metallic utensils (shiny) and glass (reflective) contrast with matte napkin/tablecloth.\n- **Lighting**: Top-left light source creates subtle highlights (utensils, glass) and shadows (plate, utensils).\n\n\n## **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThere are no text or symbols in the image. Key **micro-details** for SVG accuracy:\n- **Utensil Highlights**: Small white circles (1–4px radius) on:\n  - Fork tines (1px, `(150, 100)`).\n  - Knife blade (2px, `(190, 100)`).\n  - Spoon bowl (3px, `(230, 100)`).\n  - Glass (4px, `(430, 140)`).\n- **Food Texture**: Baked goods have 10–15 green/red specks; white fluffy stuff has a \"messy\" edge (use `path` elements with irregular curves).\n- **Grid Pattern**: Tablecloth grid lines are 20px apart (1cm = 20px) with 0.2px strokes to avoid clutter.\n- **Shadows**: Low-opacity (30%) shapes to mimic soft lighting:\n  - Plate: Half-circle (`(320, 200)`, 150px radius).\n  - Utensils: Thin rectangles (20px wide) to the right of each utensil.\n  - Glass: Half-circle (`(400, 200)`, 30px radius).\n\n\n## **6. SVG-Specific Notes for Reproduction**\nTo ensure scalability and accuracy, use these vector-friendly techniques:\n- **Shapes**:\n  - Plate: `<circle cx=\"300\" cy=\"200\" r=\"150\" fill=\"#F0E6D6\" stroke=\"#D9C6B0\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>`.\n  - Baked Goods: `<polygon points=\"200,180 240,180 220,240\" fill=\"#8F9779\"/>` (adjust points for irregularity).\n  - Green Beans: `<rect x=\"240\" y=\"160\" width=\"100\" height=\"10\" rx=\"5\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#2E8B57\" stroke=\"#228B22\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>` (rotate slightly for naturalness).\n- **Gradients**:\n  - White Fluffy Stuff: Use a radial gradient for volume:\n    ```svg\n    <radialGradient id=\"fluff\" cx=\"0.5\" cy=\"0.5\" r=\"0.5\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#F0F0F0\"/>\n    </radialGradient>\n    ```\n- **Stitched Border**:\n  - Napkin: Add a dashed stroke for the border:\n    ```svg\n    <rect x=\"120\" y=\"40\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" fill=\"#F0E6D6\" stroke=\"#D9C6B0\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-dasharray=\"4 2\"/>\n    ```\n- **Highlights**:\n  - Utensils/Glass: Small `<circle>` elements with high opacity:\n    ```svg\n    <circle cx=\"150\" cy=\"100\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" opacity=\"0.8\"/> <!-- Fork tine highlight -->\n    ```\n- **Grid Pattern**:\n  - Tablecloth: Use a `<pattern>` to repeat the grid:\n    ```svg\n    <pattern id=\"grid\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n      <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"20\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"#D9C6B0\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n      <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"20\" stroke=\"#D9C6B0\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n    </pattern>\n    <rect width=\"600\" height=\"400\" fill=\"url(#grid)\" fill-opacity=\"0.1\"/>\n    ```\n\n\n## **Final Checklist for Accuracy**\n- [ ] Plate is centered with a 300px diameter.\n- [ ] Food items are arranged diagonally (baked goods → green beans → white stuff).\n- [ ] Utensils are aligned vertically on the napkin (fork → knife → spoon).\n- [ ] Glass is positioned to the right of the plate, with liquid filling 50% of the height.\n- [ ] Shadows and highlights are subtle and consistent with a top-left light source.\n- [ ] All colors and textures match the hex codes and style notes above.\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s balance, texture, and minimalist charm.",
  "v1_125": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of all visual elements, including geometric properties, proportions, textures, and spatial relationships. The image is a **realistic product photo** focusing on a Coca-Cola can and a pile of glossy, sauced chicken wings, with a shallow depth of field (blurred background) to draw attention to the main subjects.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is divided into two primary focal points:  \n- **Left Third**: A full, unopened Coca-Cola can (cylindrical).  \n- **Right Two-Thirds**: A stack of 5–7 chicken wings (irregular, elongated shapes) on a white plate, with a metal fork partially inserted into the front wing.  \n\n#### **Coca-Cola Can**  \n- **Shape**: Perfect cylinder with a flat, metallic top and bottom.  \n- **Dimensions**: Occupies ~30% of the image width (left edge to ~1/3 of the frame) and 95% of the image height (top to bottom).  \n- **Key Features**:  \n  - Classic red label with a white \"wave\" (dynamic curve) running vertically from the bottom to the top right of the can.  \n  - Metallic silver lid (with a subtle embossed \"Coca-Cola\" logo, though not highly detailed in the image) and base.  \n  - Text elements: \"Coca-Cola\" (script font), \"Schutzmarken\" (trademark), and nutritional information.  \n\n#### **Chicken Wings**  \n- **Shape**: Irregular, elongated \"drummet\" (flat, muscle-rich part) and \"flats\" (bone-in segments) stacked haphazardly. The **front wing** is the largest and most prominent, angled diagonally from the bottom center to the top right of the plate.  \n- **Texture**: Crispy, textured skin with a thick, glossy barbecue-style sauce coating. Visible muscle fibers and slight char marks on some edges.  \n- **Sauce**: Drips and pools on the white plate beneath the wings, with a sticky, reflective surface.  \n\n#### **Fork**  \n- **Shape**: Four-tined metal fork, positioned in the **bottom right corner** of the image. Tines are inserted into the front wing, with the handle extending off-frame to the right.  \n- **Texture**: Metallic, with a slight brushed finish and subtle reflections.  \n\n#### **Plate**  \n- **Shape**: Circular, white ceramic plate (partially cropped by the image edges). Occupies the lower two-thirds of the right side, supporting the wings.  \n- **Details**: Small sauce drips along the rim and center.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors and textures are critical for realism, especially the contrast between the can’s smoothness and the wings’ glossy, textured surface.  \n\n#### **Coca-Cola Can**  \n- **Red Label**: Pantone 485 C (vibrant, matte red) with a slight sheen.  \n- **White Wave**: Bright white, curved from the bottom left to the top right of the can, overlapping the red label.  \n- **Metallic Top/Bottom**: Silver (cool gray) with a reflective highlight on the **top left** (simulating light from the upper left).  \n- **Text Color**: All text on the can is **white** (high contrast against red).  \n\n#### **Chicken Wings**  \n- **Sauce**: Deep mahogany brown (#4E2610) with glossy, light-reflective highlights (#8B4513) on the upper surfaces (where light hits).  \n- **Meat**: Lighter brown (#A0522D) showing through the sauce in areas (e.g., along the edges of the front wing).  \n- **Skin**: Crispy, textured surface with subtle orange-brown (#D2691E) undertones and char marks (dark brown/black specks).  \n\n#### **Sauce on Plate**  \n- **Pools/Drips**: Darker brown (#381C0A) than the wing sauce, with a wet, reflective finish.  \n\n#### **Fork**  \n- **Metal**: Gunmetal gray (#808080) with a slight blue tint, and a soft reflection of the wings on the tines.  \n\n#### **Plate**  \n- **Base**: Bright white (#FFFFFF) with a matte finish, dirtied by sauce drips.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Color**: Soft, muted blue (#6495ED) with a radial blur (focus on the can and wings), simulating a blurred tablecloth or wall.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **asymmetrical**, with the can anchoring the left and the wings dominating the right.  \n\n#### **Coca-Cola Can**  \n- **Position**: Aligned with the **left edge** of the image, centered vertically (top of the can is ~5% below the image top; bottom is ~5% above the image bottom).  \n- **Overlap**: No overlap with the wings—separated by a small gap (~5% of the image width) between the can’s right edge and the plate’s left edge.  \n\n#### **Chicken Wings**  \n- **Stacking**: The front wing is the closest to the viewer, positioned at the **bottom center-right** of the image. It overlaps the wings behind it, which are progressively smaller and more blurred (depth of field).  \n- **Plate**: The wings rest on the plate, which extends from the **center** of the image to the **right edge**. The plate’s left edge is ~1/3 of the way from the left (aligned with the can’s right edge).  \n\n#### **Fork**  \n- **Position**: Tines inserted into the **bottom right of the front wing**, with the handle extending off-frame to the right. The fork’s top tine is ~10% above the image bottom; the bottom tine is ~5% above the bottom.  \n- **Overlap**: Tines are partially hidden by the front wing, with 2–3 tines visible above the wing.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Blur**: The background is most blurred in the **top right** (behind the wings) and **top left** (behind the can), with the sharpest focus on the can’s label and the front wing.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: High-fidelity product photography with extreme attention to texture (e.g., can’s metallic sheen, wings’ crispy skin, sauce’s gloss).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the **upper left**, creating:  \n  - A bright highlight on the can’s silver lid (left side).  \n  - Glossy reflections on the wings’ sauce (upper surfaces).  \n  - Subtle shadows under the can and wings (indicating a light source above).  \n- **Depth of Field**: Shallow (f/2.8–f/4), blurring the background to isolate the can and wings.  \n- **Composition**: Rule of thirds—can is at the left third, wings at the right two-thirds. The front wing’s leading edge aligns with the **golden ratio** (1.618) from the left.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text on the can is **white** and positioned precisely for brand recognition.  \n\n#### **Coca-Cola Can Text**  \n- **Primary Text**: \"Coca-Cola\" in the iconic Spencerian script font, spanning 70% of the can’s height.  \n  - **Placement**: Starts at the **bottom left** of the can, curving upward to the center-right. The \"C\" of \"Coca\" is ~10% above the can’s base; the \"a\" of \"Cola\" is ~10% below the can’s top.  \n- **Trademark Text**: \"Schutzmarken\" (German for \"trademarks\") in small, uppercase sans-serif font.  \n  - **Placement**: To the **right of the \"Coca-Cola\" script**, above the white wave. Occupies ~5% of the can’s width and 2% of the height.  \n- **Nutritional Information**: Small sans-serif text at the **bottom left** of the can:  \n  - \"105 kcal\" (larger than the following line).  \n  - \"5%*\" (likely 5% of daily value for a nutrient, e.g., sugar).  \n  - **Size**: ~2% of the can’s height, aligned left with the \"Coca-Cola\" script.  \n\n#### **Wing Details**  \n- **Sauce Highlights**: 3–4 bright white/light brown highlights on each wing, positioned on the **upper left edges** (where light hits the glossy sauce). The largest highlight is on the front wing’s top center.  \n- **Bone Visibility**: A small section of bone is visible on the **top right of the front wing** (partially covered by sauce).  \n- **Sauce Drips**: 4–5 small, irregular drips on the plate, concentrated around the base of the wings.  \n\n#### **Can Details**  \n- **Metallic Lid**: A subtle \"Coca-Cola\" embossment is present on the lid, though it’s not highly detailed in the image (can be simplified in SVG).  \n- **Reflection**: A white, oval reflection on the **top left of the lid** (simulating a light source).  \n- **White Wave**: The wave starts at the **bottom center** of the can, curves upward to the **top right**, and tapers to a point at the top. It overlaps the red label by ~10% of the can’s width.  \n\n\n### **6. Critical Proportions for SVG Recreation**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following proportional guidelines (based on a 1000px × 1000px image):  \n\n| Element | Width | Height | Position (X/Y) |  \n|---------|-------|--------|----------------|  \n| **Coca-Cola Can** | 300px | 950px | X: 0px (left edge), Y: 25px (top margin) |  \n| **Front Chicken Wing** | 500px | 300px | X: 350px (right of can), Y: 400px (center) |  \n| **Plate** | 700px | 400px | X: 300px (right of can), Y: 600px (bottom) |  \n| **Fork Tines** | 200px | 50px | X: 600px (right), Y: 850px (bottom) |  \n\n#### **Text Sizing**  \n- \"Coca-Cola\" Script: 600px tall (from bottom of \"C\" to top of \"a\").  \n- \"Schutzmarken\": 20px tall, 80px wide.  \n- \"105 kcal\": 15px tall, 50px wide.  \n- \"5%*\": 12px tall, 30px wide.  \n\n\n### **7. Texture and Highlight Guidelines**\n- **Can**:  \n  - Red label: Smooth, with a slight gradient (darker red at the edges, lighter red in the center) to simulate curvature.  \n  - White wave: Flat, bright white with no gradient.  \n  - Metallic lid: Linear gradient (light silver at the top left, dark silver at the bottom right) to simulate reflection.  \n- **Wings**:  \n  - Sauce: Radial gradients (dark brown center, light brown edges) on the glossy areas; use clip paths to add texture (e.g., small specks of char).  \n  - Skin: Noise filter (subtle grain) to simulate crispiness.  \n- **Fork**:  \n  - Tines: Linear gradient (light gray at the top, dark gray at the bottom) to simulate depth.  \n\n\n### **8. Final Notes for SVG**\n- **Layers**: Use separate layers for the can, wings, plate, fork, and background to enable easy editing.  \n- **Clipping Paths**: Use clipping paths for the wings to simulate overlap (e.g., the front wing clips the wings behind it).  \n- **Gradients**: Use linear/radial gradients extensively to replicate texture (e.g., can’s metallic lid, wings’ glossy sauce).  \n- **Blur**: Apply a Gaussian blur to the background (radius: 20px) and to the wings behind the front one (radius: 5–10px) to simulate depth of field.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s realism, composition, and brand identity.",

Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **realistic yet simplified style** suitable for SVG, with a focus on clarity and texture. Key artistic choices:\n\n- **Flat Design with Depth**: Objects use solid colors with subtle gradients (e.g., bread crust `#d4af37` to `#8b4513` for depth) and soft shadows (10% opacity `#808080`).\n- **Texture Hierarchy**: Woven basket (coarse) > bread crust (rough) > salad (medium) > dip (smooth) > marble (matte).\n- **Lighting**: Soft front-left light source, creating:\n  - **Highlights**: White 10–15% opacity highlights on the marble, glass bottles, and dip.\n  - **Shadows**: 10% opacity `#808080` shadows to the right/bottom of all objects (basket shadow: 20px × 10px; salad bowl: 15px × 8px; dip plate: 10px × 5px).\n- **Negative Space**: The marble tabletop provides ample negative space, keeping the composition balanced (basket/salad/dip in front; plates/bottles in back).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Bottle Labels**: \n  - **Olive Oil**: Brown label (`#8b4513`) with black text (e.g., \"Olive Oil\" – not legible in detail, but include a 80px × 20px rectangle with 1px `#000000` text placeholder).\n  - **Vinegar**: Orange label (`#ff6347`) with black text (e.g., \"Vinegar\" – same placeholder as oil).\n- **Bread Sesame Seeds**: 1px `#8b4513` dots on the back slice (5–7 seeds).\n- **Salad Herb Strips**: 3–4 thin (`1px`) brown (`#8b4513`) strips on top of the feta (45° angle).\n- **Dip Spill**: Small `#f0fff0` (dip color) spot (`10px × 10px`) on the table to the right of the tzatziki plate.\n- **Plate Reflections**: Faint `#f8f8f8` (white) circles (50px diameter) in the center of each empty plate (15% opacity).\n\n\n### **5. Critical SVG Notes for Reproduction**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these technical details:\n\n- **Shapes**: \n  - Basket: Oval (`rx=\"150\" ry=\"75\"`).\n  - Salad Bowl: Rectangular with rounded corners (`rx=\"20\" ry=\"20\"`).\n  - Utensils: Fork (four tines, 5px wide each); knife (straight blade, 20px wide).\n- **Shadows**: All objects have a **drop shadow** (`#808080`, 10% opacity) offset by `(5px, 5px)` (right/bottom).\n- **Transparency**: Glass bottles (80% opacity), dip highlight (15% opacity), marble veins (50% opacity).\n- **Text**: Bottle labels use a sans-serif font (`10px`, `#000000`) – exact text is not legible, but include placeholder text aligned vertically.\n\n\n### **Summary of Key Proportions**\n| **Element**              | **Relative Size (to Canvas)** | **Aspect Ratio** |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Basket**               | 30% width, 25% height          | 2:1              |\n| **Salad Bowl**           | 35% width, 33% height          | 3:2              |\n| **Tzatziki Plate**       | 20% width, 33% height          | 1:1              |\n| **Empty Plates**         | 25% width, 42% height          | 1:1              |\n| **Oil/Vinegar Bottles**  | 10% height, 3% width           | 10:1             |\n\nThis description provides all necessary information to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG, including geometric constraints, color values, and spatial logic.",
  "v1_127": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its components, focusing on **geometric shapes, proportions, colors, textures, spatial relationships, and stylistic choices**. The description prioritizes precision for vector-based reproduction, including layer order, filter applications, and detailed feature definitions.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a close-up composition with three primary focal layers (from foreground to background):  \n- **Parrot** (sharp focus): Perched on a human index finger, with a streamlined body, folded wings, and a patterned head.  \n- **Human Hand** (sharp focus): Extending from the bottom center, with the index finger straight, middle/ring fingers curled, and thumb partially visible.  \n- **Background** (blurred): A human face (centered, soft features) and green foliage (abstract, natural shapes).  \n\n#### **Parrot Anatomy (Focal Point)**\nThe parrot’s body is a **slender oval** (length: ~4x its width) with a tapered tail (partially visible). Key sub-elements:  \n- **Wings**: Folded tightly against the body, each wing is a **triangular shape** with overlapping, curved feathers. Each feather is a **curved rectangle** with a pointed tip, arranged in rows (3–4 rows per wing).  \n- **Head**: A **rounded rectangle** (width: ~1/3 body length) with a short, curved **black beak** (length: ~1/4 head width) and a small white tip at the base.  \n- **Eyes**: Large, circular (diameter: ~1/3 head width) with a **white outer ring**, **black inner pupil**, and a tiny white highlight (10 o’clock position) for shine.  \n- **Feet**: Zygodactyl (two toes forward, two backward) with **scaled texture** (visible as fine lines). Each toe ends in a sharp claw.  \n- **Feather Patterns**:  \n  - **Wings**: Green base feathers with blue edges (alternating light/dark green for depth).  \n  - **Chest**: Solid red patch (extending from the neck to the belly).  \n  - **Head**: Horizontal stripes (black, white, gray) with a yellowish-green cheek patch (between the eye and beak).  \n  - **Back/Tail**: Teal feathers (blending into the wing colors).  \n\n#### **Human Hand (Focal Point)**\nThe hand is positioned at the **bottom center** of the image, with the index finger extended toward the camera. Shapes:  \n- **Index Finger**: Long, curved rectangle (length: ~2x the parrot’s foot width) with a rounded tip. The parrot’s feet grip the first knuckle.  \n- **Middle/Ring Fingers**: Curled into the palm, forming semicircular shapes.  \n- **Thumb**: Partially visible, tucked under the index finger.  \n- **Palm**: A curved, oval shape connecting the fingers.  \n- **Nails**: Small, rounded rectangles (natural color, no polish) on the index and middle fingers.  \n\n#### **Background Elements (Blurred)**\n- **Human Face**: Centered in the background, an **oval shape** with soft, indistinct features (blurred eyes, nose, and a smiling mouth). The eyes are aligned with the parrot’s head.  \n- **Hair**: Dark brown, braided over the **right shoulder** (viewer’s perspective). The braid is a curved path with subtle texture (blurred for depth).  \n- **Foliage**: Abstract green shapes (ellipses, rectangles, irregular polygons) filling the background, mimicking leaves/trees.  \n\n#### **Shirt**\nA light-colored (white/pale blue) garment with a loose collar, visible at the bottom of the face/neck area.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are vibrant but balanced, with no harsh contrasts (due to soft lighting). Textures are simplified for SVG but retain realism.  \n\n| Element                | Colors (Hex Codes/Descriptions)                                                                 | Textures/Visual Properties                                                                 |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Parrot Wings**       | Primary: Emerald green (#008000); Edges: Cyan (#00FFFF)                                         | Overlapping feathers (grouped paths, front feathers on top); subtle gradient (light green center, dark green edges) for depth. |\n| **Parrot Chest**       | Scarlet red (#FF2400)                                                                           | Smooth fill; transitions to teal (#008080) under the wings.                                |\n| **Parrot Head**        | Stripes: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gray (#808080); Cheeks: Yellow-green (#9ACD32)        | Horizontal stripes (clipped to head shape); each stripe is a thin rectangle.               |\n| **Parrot Beak**        | Black (#000000) with a white tip (#FFFFFF)                                                      | Curved path; subtle shine (10% white gradient on the upper beak).                          |\n| **Parrot Eyes**        | White (#FFFFFF) outer circle, Black (#000000) inner circle, Tiny white highlight (#FFFFFF)       | Concentric circles; highlight is a 1px circle at 10 o’clock.                               |\n| **Parrot Feet**        | Black (#000000)                                                                                 | Scaled texture (fine diagonal lines); claws are sharp, curved paths.                       |\n| **Human Hand**         | Light skin tone with warm undertones (#F4D0B0)                                                  | Subtle palm lines (thin, light gray strokes); knuckles indicated by slight bulges.          |\n| **Human Face**         | Light skin tone (#F4D0B0) with soft pink cheeks (#F8D7DA)                                        | Blurred (feGaussianBlur, stdDeviation=3); eyes as small, blurred black circles (#000000), mouth as a curved pink line (#FFB6C1). |\n| **Human Hair**         | Dark brown (#331900)                                                                            | Blurred (feGaussianBlur, stdDeviation=2); braid indicated by a thin, lighter brown stroke (#663300). |\n| **Foliage Background** | Radial gradient: Center (light green #90EE90), Edges (dark green #228B22)                        | Blurred (feGaussianBlur, stdDeviation=5); abstract shapes (no detailed leaves).             |\n| **Shirt**              | Pale blue (#E6F2FF)                                                                            | Smooth fill; loose collar indicated by a curved line.                                      |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **shallow depth of field**, with the parrot and hand in sharp focus, and the background (face/foliage) blurred. Key spatial rules:  \n- **Parrot**: Occupies the **left 1/3** of the image, perched on the index finger. Its head tilts downward toward the human’s chin, creating a diagonal line from the parrot’s beak to the human’s mouth.  \n- **Hand**: Extends from the **bottom center** (viewer’s perspective), with the index finger pointing toward the camera. The parrot’s feet grip the first knuckle of the index finger.  \n- **Human Face**: Centered in the background, with the eyes aligned with the parrot’s head. The face is **2x larger** than the parrot but blurred to avoid competing for focus.  \n- **Foliage**: Fills the entire background, with no clear horizon line. The radial gradient draws attention to the parrot/hand.  \n\n#### **Layer Order (Top to Bottom)**\n1. Parrot (feathers, head, eyes, beak, feet)  \n2. Human hand (fingers, palm, nails)  \n3. Human face (skin, eyes, mouth)  \n4. Human hair (braid, loose strands)  \n5. Foliage background (gradient, abstract shapes)  \n6. Shirt (collar, body)  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism with Stylization**: The parrot and hand are detailed (feather textures, skin lines), but the background is abstracted for simplicity.  \n- **Depth of Field**: Achieved via SVG filters (feGaussianBlur) on the face/foliage. The parrot/hand have sharp edges and no blur.  \n- **Lighting**: Even, soft lighting with no harsh shadows. Colors are vibrant but not over-saturated (e.g., parrot’s green wings have blue edges to mimic light reflection).  \n- **Negative Space**: The parrot’s left side (wing) leaves empty space, balancing the composition with the human’s face on the right.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text/Symbols**: None.  \n- **Parrot Details**:  \n  - **Zygodactyl Feet**: Two toes forward (inner/outer), two backward (inner/outer). Critical for realism—ensure the toes are positioned correctly (e.g., left foot: toes 1/2 forward, 3/4 backward).  \n  - **Beak Tip**: Small white spot (1px) at the base of the upper beak.  \n  - **Eye Highlight**: Tiny white circle (1px) at the top-right of the eye to mimic catchlights.  \n- **Hand Details**:  \n  - **Nails**: Short, rounded, with no polish. The index finger nail is visible on the right side (viewer’s perspective).  \n  - **Knuckles**: Slight bulges on the middle/ring fingers, indicated by subtle gradients (lighter skin tone).  \n- **Face Details**:  \n  - **Eyes**: Blurred black circles (#000000) with a tiny white highlight (1px) to suggest focus.  \n  - **Mouth**: Curved pink line (#FFB6C1) to indicate a smile.  \n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Technical Notes**\nTo recreate the image accurately in SVG, use these technical guidelines:  \n- **Blur Filters**: Apply `feGaussianBlur` to the face (stdDeviation=3), hair (stdDeviation=2), and foliage (stdDeviation=5). Use a `filter` element and reference it with `filter=\"url(#blur)\"`.  \n- **Feather Textures**: Create wings as groups of overlapping `path` elements (each feather). Use `clip-path` to constrain stripes to the parrot’s head shape.  \n- **Gradients**: Use `linearGradient` for parrot feathers (green to blue) and `radialGradient` for the foliage background (light to dark green).  \n- **Scaling**: Set the viewBox to `0 0 1000 1000` for flexibility. The parrot’s body should be ~200px long, the hand ~300px from wrist to finger tip.  \n- **Stroke Widths**: Use thin strokes (1–2px) for feather edges and hand lines. Avoid thick strokes, as they can make the SVG look cartoonish.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key Measurements (for 1000x1000 viewBox)**\n| Element                | Dimensions (px) | Position (x, y) |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Parrot Body (Oval)     | 200 (length) x 80 (width) | (150, 300) |\n| Parrot Head (Rounded Rectangle) | 60 (length) x 40 (width) | (250, 280) |\n| Index Finger (Curved Rectangle) | 150 (length) x 30 (width) | (300, 500) |\n| Human Face (Oval)      | 400 (width) x 500 (height) | (500, 200) |\n| Foliage Background (Rectangle) | 1000 x 1000 | (0, 0) |\n\n\nThis description provides all the necessary details to recreate the image as an SVG, including geometric precision, color values, layer order, and stylistic choices. The focus on vector-friendly techniques (e.g., gradients, filters, grouped paths) ensures the final SVG will be scalable and accurate to the original image.",
  "v1_128": "To recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** with geometric precision, proportional guidelines, and layout instructions. The description uses a **100-unit coordinate system** (width = 100 units, height = 100 units) for consistent positioning and scaling.\n\n\n### **1.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nUsing the **100-unit coordinate system** (origin: bottom-left corner), objects are positioned relative to each other for realistic depth:  \n\n| Object               | Position (X, Y)   | Size (Width, Height) | Relationship to Other Objects         |\n|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Window**           | `(30, 0)`         | `(40, 40)`           | Centered behind the rug; frame borders the glass. |\n| **Couch**            | `(0, 35)`         | `(30, 30)`           | Left edge; legs rest on the floor.     |\n| **Side Table**       | `(15, 15)`        | `(10, 10)`           | Next to the couch; top aligns with the couch’s back. |\n| **Rug**              | `(50, 50)`        | `(60, 40)`           | Centered on the floor; pets stand/sit on it. |\n| **Coffee Table**     | `(75, 10)`        | `(25, 15)`           | Right edge; bowl sits on the top-left corner. |\n| **Cat**              | `(50, 50)`        | `(20, 10)`           | Centered on the rug; facing the window. |\n| **Corgi**            | `(27.5, 50)`      | `(15, 10)`           | Left of the cat; standing on hind legs. |\n| **White Paper**      | `(50, 65)`        | `(20, 10)`           | Below the rug; slightly folded.        |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe SVG style is **simplified and geometric**, prioritizing clarity over photographic realism. Key artistic choices:  \n- **Flat Design**: All elements use solid colors with no gradients or shadows (except the window glass, which has 50% opacity).  \n- **Proportional Realism**: Pets and furniture follow real-world proportions (e.g., the corgi is smaller than the cat, the couch is taller than the side table).  \n- **Pattern Repetition**: The rug’s pattern (blue circles + brown squares) is a repeating grid, ensuring consistency across the oval.  \n- **Minimal Detail**: Fur texture is implied with solid colors; whiskers, fur strands, and fabric wrinkles are omitted for simplicity.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No Text**: The image contains no visible text.  \n- **Symbols**: The only symbolic element is the **purple bowl** on the coffee table (simple circle, no decorative details).  \n- **Key Details for SVG Accuracy**:  \n  - **Cat Tail**: The tail is a **bezier curve** (not a straight line) to mimic a natural curl. Control points (`35 52`, `32 54`) ensure a smooth arc from the body to the tip.  \n  - **Corgi Paws**: Front paws are raised (above the body) to show the puppy’s playful stance; hind legs are thick and sturdy (3x5 units) to support the body.  \n  - **Rug Border**: A 1-unit gray stroke around the oval distinguishes the rug from the floor.  \n  - **White Paper**: A 5-degree rotation and slight \"fold\" (implied by the rectangle’s edges) add realism to the foreground element.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\nTo accurately reproduce the image as an SVG:  \n1. **Layer Order**: Floor → Window → Couch → Side Table → Rug → Coffee Table → Cat → Corgi → White Paper.  \n2. **Shapes**: Use basic SVG primitives (`rect`, `ellipse`, `path`, `polygon`) for all objects. The cat’s tail and corgi’s ears require `path` elements for curves and angles.  \n3. **Patterns**: The rug’s pattern can be created with a `<pattern>` element (repeating blue circles and brown squares) applied to the oval’s fill.  \n4. **Colors**: Use the hex values provided for consistent coloring; ensure the window glass has 50% opacity.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary geometric, proportional, and stylistic details to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG.",

SVG-Specific Notes for Recreation\nTo ensure the SVG is **editable and accurate**, follow these guidelines:\n\n- **Vectorize All Elements**: Use `<rect>`, `<text>`, `<path>`, and `<circle>` elements instead of raster images.\n- **Fonts**: Use a **system font** like `Chalkduster` (macOS) or `Comic Sans MS` (Windows) for the hand-drawn look. If a custom font is needed, create an SVG font with hand-drawn glyphs.\n- **Filters**: Apply `feGaussianBlur` to the background elements and `feNoise` to the chalkboard. Example:\n  ```svg\n  <filter id=\"chalkboard-grain\">\n    <feNoise type=\"monochrome\" stdDeviation=\"0.5\" result=\"noise\"/>\n    <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\" mode=\"multiply\"/>\n  </filter>\n  <rect x=\"672\" y=\"0\" width=\"1248\" height=\"1080\" fill=\"#000000\" filter=\"url(#chalkboard-grain)\"/>\n  ```\n- **Responsiveness**: Set the SVG to `width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"` to scale with the container.\n- **Accessibility**: Add `alt` text to all elements (e.g., `<text alt=\"Pizza menu\">PIZZA</text>`) for screen readers.\n\n\n## Summary of Key SVG Components\n| Element | SVG Tag | Key Attributes |\n|---------|---------|----------------|\n| Chalkboard | `<rect>` | `x=\"672\" y=\"0\" width=\"1248\" height=\"1080\" fill=\"#000000\" filter=\"url(#chalkboard-grain)\"` |\n| \"PIZZA\" Header | `<text>` | `x=\"50%\" y=\"100\" font-size=\"200\" fill=\"#FF69B4\" text-anchor=\"middle\"` |\n| Pizza Menu Item | `<text>` | `x=\"150\" y=\"300\" font-size=\"80\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"` (names) + `x=\"900\" y=\"300\" font-size=\"80\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"` (prices) |\n| \"FREE WIFI\" Stripe | `<path>` | `d=\"M1920 0 L1200 600\" stroke=\"#90EE90\" stroke-width=\"10\" stroke-dasharray=\"5 2\"` (dashed for chalk smudge) |\n| \"CALZONE\" | `<text>` | `x=\"50%\" y=\"900\" font-size=\"150\" fill=\"#FFA500\" text-anchor=\"middle\"` |\n| Background Plant | `<g>` (group) | Contains `<ellipse>` (pot), `<path>` (leaves), `<circle>` (flowers); `filter=\"url(#gaussian-blur)\"` |\n\nBy following this detailed description, you can recreate the image as a **high-fidelity SVG** that retains all visual characteristics of the original, including the hand-drawn charm of the chalkboard and the depth of the café background.",

  "v1_130": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into measurable, geometric, and stylistic elements, organized by the user’s specified categories:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is centered on a **large elephant** (foreground) with a **human rider** seated on its back. Key background elements include: a **body of water**, **trees**, **two flags** (Thai national flag and a solid yellow flag), a **wooden fence**, and a **dirt ground** with minor vegetation.  \n\n#### **Elephant**  \n- **Overall Shape**: A massive, rounded quadruped with a thick, cylindrical trunk, large fan-shaped ears, and a tapering tail.  \n- **Trunk**: Long (≈50% of the elephant’s total height), slightly curved downward, touching the ground at the tip. Surface is wrinkled with horizontal ridges.  \n- **Ears**: Large, floppy, and triangular, with the left ear (from the viewer’s perspective) flapping slightly forward.  \n- **Legs**: Thick, columnar, with the front right leg lifted in mid-stride (suggesting movement). Feet are broad and round with distinct toenails (5 on front feet, 4 on back).  \n- **Tail**: Thin, with a tuft of black hair at the tip, hanging straight down.  \n\n#### **Rider**  \n- **Pose**: Seated upright on the elephant’s back, legs dangling over the sides. Hands rest on thighs; gaze directed forward.  \n- **Clothing**: Wears a **wide-brimmed straw hat** (conical, with a flat top), a **long-sleeved blue shirt**, and **blue jeans**. A red or orange belt accents the waist.  \n\n#### **Howdah (Elephant Saddle)**  \n- **Structure**: A rectangular padded platform on the elephant’s back, secured with:  \n  - A **braided jute harness** (chest strap and back strap) connected by a rope.  \n  - A **fringed fabric cover** (brown, shaggy) underneath the harness, extending from the middle of the back to the shoulders.  \n  - A **rectangular wooden or fabric box** (gray) on top of the harness, tied with rope.  \n\n#### **Background Elements**  \n- **Trees**: Tall, thin trunks (left foreground) with dense, leafy canopies (green, yellow, brown).  \n- **Water**: A calm, reflective body (greenish-gray) spanning the width of the background, behind the trees.  \n- **Flags**: Two triangular flags on tall, thin poles (right background):  \n  - **Thai Flag**: Horizontal stripes (red, white, blue, white, red) with a 2:3 aspect ratio.  \n  - **Yellow Flag**: Solid yellow, same shape and size as the Thai flag.  \n- **Fence**: A low, wooden rail fence (right background) behind the flags, near the water.  \n- **Ground**: Dusty brown dirt with small patches of green grass (left foreground) and wet mud spots (near the elephant’s feet).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \n#### **Elephant**  \n- **Color**: Dark gray (almost black) with subtle variations (lighter gray on the ears and trunk).  \n- **Texture**: Wrinkled, rough skin (prominent around the eyes, ears, and legs). The trunk has deep horizontal ridges; the ears have a thin, papery texture with visible veins.  \n\n#### **Rider**  \n- **Clothing**: Bright blue (shirt and jeans) with a tan straw hat. The belt has a red accent.  \n- **Texture**: Smooth fabric (shirt/jeans) vs. rough straw (hat).  \n\n#### **Howdah**  \n- **Colors**: Harness (tan, braided rope); fringed cover (brown, shaggy); box (gray, matte).  \n- **Textures**: Braided rope (textured, linear); fringed fabric (fuzzy, irregular); box (smooth).  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Trees**: Trunks (brown, smooth); leaves (various greens: lime, forest, olive; with yellow/brown accents for autumn).  \n- **Water**: Greenish-gray with a reflective, rippled texture (light highlights on the surface).  \n- **Flags**: Thai flag (vibrant red/white/blue); yellow flag (bright yellow). Both have a slightly glossy, wind-swept texture.  \n- **Ground**: Dirt (warm brown, dusty); grass (bright green, short); mud (dark brown, wet, reflective).  \n\n#### **Lighting**  \n- **Direction**: Soft, natural light from the left (creates subtle shadows on the elephant’s right side, rider’s hat, and tree trunks).  \n- **Highlights**: Elephant’s ears (light gray highlights on the edges); water (small, bright reflections); rider’s shirt (glossy blue highlights).  \n- **Shadows**: Elephant’s body casts a soft shadow on the ground; tree canopies cast dappled shade on the dirt.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe composition is balanced, with the elephant as the focal point (foreground) and background elements framing the scene.  \n\n#### **Elephant**  \n- **Position**: Centered in the image, facing left. The trunk extends toward the left foreground, touching the ground.  \n- **Proportions**:  \n  - **Height**: ~2.5x the rider’s height (rider is ≈1/3 the elephant’s height).  \n  - **Body**: Length (from trunk tip to tail) ≈2.5x the height; width (shoulders) ≈1.5x the height.  \n  - **Ears**: Each ear is ≈1/2 the elephant’s height, flaring outward at a 45° angle from the head.  \n\n#### **Rider**  \n- **Position**: Seated on the **anterior third** of the elephant’s back, legs hanging over the left side. The hat is tilted slightly forward; gaze is directed toward the left.  \n- **Proportions**: The rider’s head (including hat) is ≈1/4 the elephant’s height.  \n\n#### **Howdah**  \n- **Position**: Covers the **middle third** of the elephant’s back (from shoulders to mid-back). The harness wraps around the chest (just behind the ears) and back (above the hips).  \n- **Proportions**: The harness is ≈1/5 the elephant’s circumference (chest); the fringed cover extends ≈1/2 the length of the back.  \n\n#### **Background Elements**  \n- **Trees**: Left foreground, with trunks overlapping the elephant’s left side. Canopies extend to the top of the image.  \n- **Water**: Behind the trees, spanning the width of the image. The horizon line is at ≈1/3 the image height.  \n- **Flags**: Right background, behind the elephant’s hind legs. The poles are ≈1/2 the image height; flags are ≈1/4 the image height.  \n- **Fence**: Right background, parallel to the water, behind the flags.  \n\n#### **Chain**  \n- **Position**: Attached to the elephant’s chest harness (braided band), extending to the right out of the frame.  \n- **Color**: Silver (metallic, with subtle shadows).  \n- **Texture**: Linked metal rings (smooth, reflective).  \n- **Proportions**: The chain is ≈2x the elephant’s body length (from chest to the end of the visible chain).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Realism**: The image is highly realistic, with detailed textures (elephant skin, tree leaves) and natural lighting.  \n- **Composition**: Balanced, with the elephant as the focal point. The background elements (trees, water, flags) frame the scene and create depth.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, natural daylight with warm tones (from the sun) and cool tones (from the water/trees). Shadows are subtle and directional (left light source).  \n- **Depth**: Foreground (elephant, rider, dirt), middle ground (trees, water), background (flags, fence). The water and trees create a sense of distance.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details and Symbols**  \n- **Elephant’s Eyes**: Small, dark brown with a slight reflective highlight (suggesting intelligence).  \n- **Rider’s Posture**: Relaxed, with one hand resting on the elephant’s back and the other on his thigh.  \n- **Chain**: Attached to a **braided leather or jute band** (tan) around the elephant’s chest. The band is secured with a metal buckle (silver).  \n- **Blue Object**: A small, indistinct blue item (possibly a bucket) near the left edge of the water, behind the trees.  \n- **Grass**: Tiny tufts of green grass in the left foreground, near the elephant’s front feet.  \n- **Mud Spots**: Wet, dark brown mud near the elephant’s feet (left foreground), with subtle reflections.  \n- **Flags**: The Thai flag is a key symbol (national identity), while the yellow flag may represent the monarchy (common in Thailand).  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric and Proportional Guidelines for SVG**  \nTo ensure accurate reproduction, use the following proportional references (based on the elephant as the primary unit):  \n- **Elephant**:  \n  - **Height**: 100 units (from ground to top of back).  \n  - **Length**: 250 units (from trunk tip to tail tip).  \n  - **Width**: 150 units (shoulder to shoulder).  \n- **Rider**:  \n  - **Height**: 35 units (from ground to top of hat).  \n  - **Position**: Seated at 70 units from the ground (top of elephant’s back).  \n- **Howdah**:  \n  - **Harness**: 20 units wide (chest band); 10 units thick (rope).  \n  - **Fringed Cover**: 50 units long (back to shoulders); 30 units wide.  \n  - **Box**: 30 units long × 20 units wide × 10 units tall.  \n- **Flags**:  \n  - **Poles**: 80 units tall (from ground to flag top).  \n  - **Flags**: 40 units long × 25 units wide (triangular).  \n- **Water**:  \n  - **Height**: 40 units (from ground to horizon).  \n  - **Width**: 100% of the image (spans left to right).  \n\n#### **Key Shapes for SVG**  \n- **Elephant**: Use Bézier curves to define the rounded body, trunk (curved line with ridges), and ears (triangular with rounded edges).  \n- **Howdah**: Rectangular box with rounded corners; braided rope (repeating linear pattern); fringed fabric (irregular, short lines).  \n- **Flags**: Triangular shapes with straight edges; poles (thin rectangles).  \n- **Water**: Rectangular shape with a wavy top edge (ripples) and gradient fill (light to dark green).  \n- **Chain**: Linked ovals (repeating pattern) with a metallic gradient.  \n\n\n### **7. Final Notes for SVG**  \n- **Layers**: Organize elements into layers (foreground: elephant/rider; middle ground: trees/water; background: flags/fence; ground: dirt/grass).  \n- **Textures**: Use gradients (elephant skin, water) and patterns (braided rope, fringed fabric) to replicate textures.  \n- **Lighting**: Add subtle drop shadows (elephant, rider) and highlight layers (water, elephant ears) to mimic natural light.  \n- **Accuracy**: Pay close attention to the elephant’s anatomy (wrinkles, ear shape, leg position) and the rider’s clothing (blue color, hat shape) for realism.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately reflect the composition, details, and style of the original image.",
  "v1_131": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of **main objects**, **colors/textures**, **spatial relationships**, **style**, and **specific details**. Below is a structured, technical description optimized for vector reproduction:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **surfer in action** atop a breaking wave, with three primary layers:  \n- **Foreground**: Surfer + surfboard  \n- **Midground**: Breaking wave + splashes  \n- **Background**: Gradient sky + calm water  \n\n#### **Surfer**  \nA human figure in a **crouched stance** (key for dynamic motion):  \n- **Head**: Oval (slightly tilted downward/forward).  \n- **Hair**: Long, wavy red strands (blowing backward; 5–7 distinct, curved strands).  \n- **Torso**: Upper body in a purple long-sleeve top (tight-fitting, with a slight backward lean).  \n- **Arms**:  \n  - **Right arm**: Extended straight upward (palm facing forward).  \n  - **Left arm**: Bent at the elbow (forearm parallel to the ground, palm facing downward).  \n- **Legs**:  \n  - **Right leg**: Knee raised high (thigh nearly parallel to the ground, calf angled downward).  \n  - **Left leg**: Knee slightly bent (foot flat on the surfboard, positioned toward the tail).  \n- **Gloves**: Black, fitted (covers entire hand; right glove matches extended arm, left glove matches bent arm).  \n- **Wetsuit Pants**: Black, high-waisted (tight-fitting, with a small yellow logo on the **left thigh**).  \n- **Feet**: Black booties (attached to the surfboard via traction pads).  \n\n#### **Surfboard**  \nA **shortboard** (white, rectangular with rounded ends):  \n- **Shape**: Length ≈ 1.5x the surfer’s height (crouched). Nose (front) is more rounded than the tail (back).  \n- **Logo**: Black, stylized text (e.g., \"Vans\" or similar) on the **top-left corner** (visible when viewing the board from above).  \n- **Traction Pads**: Small, dark gray rectangles near the tail (under the surfer’s back foot).  \n- **Leash**: Blue cord attached to the **right ankle** (trails behind the board, curving into the water).  \n\n#### **Wave**  \nA **breaking \"face\" wave** (curved, dynamic shape):  \n- **Crest**: White, frothy foam (irregular, jagged edges) curling over the surfer’s shoulders.  \n- **Body**: Teal, smooth curve (extends from the right edge of the image to the surfer’s back).  \n- **Splashes**: White, chaotic shapes (originating from the surfboard’s tail and the surfer’s legs; 10–15 distinct splashes).  \n\n#### **Water**  \n- **Calm Foreground**: Teal, rippled surface (horizontal, parallel lines with varying opacity).  \n- **Midground**: Turbulent water (mix of teal and white splashes, merging with the wave).  \n\n#### **Background**  \nA **gradient sky** (dark gray at the top, fading to light gray at the horizon) that transitions seamlessly into the water.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified as **hex codes** for SVG accuracy. Textures are described as vector-friendly (e.g., gradients, lines).  \n\n| Element               | Color (Hex)                          | Texture/Visual Properties                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Surfer**            |                                      |                                                                                           |\n| - Top                 | `#8A2BE2` (medium purple)            | Smooth, slightly shiny (subtle linear gradient: `#8A2BE2` → `#6A1B9A` at the edges).       |\n| - Pants               | `#000000` (black)                    | Shiny, stretchy (linear gradient: `#000000` → `#222222` along the legs).                   |\n| - Gloves              | `#000000` (black)                    | Matches pants; smooth texture.                                                            |\n| - Hair                | `#FF4500` (orange-red)               | Wet, wavy (5–7 curved `polyline` elements with `#FF4500` fill; slight transparency).       |\n| - Booties             | `#000000` (black)                    | Fitted; same texture as pants.                                                            |\n| **Surfboard**         |                                      |                                                                                           |\n| - Base                | `#FFFFFF` (white)                    | Smooth, matte (slight radial gradient: `#FFFFFF` → `#E0E0E0` at the edges for depth).      |\n| - Logo                | `#000000` (black)                    | Stylized text (e.g., \"Vans\") on the top-left corner; 10–15% of the board’s length.         |\n| - Traction Pads       | `#444444` (dark gray)                | Small, rectangular; 2–3 pads near the tail.                                               |\n| **Wave**              |                                      |                                                                                           |\n| - Body                | `#008080` (teal) → `#00FFFF` (cyan)  | Gradient from dark teal (bottom) to light cyan (top) for volume.                           |\n| - Crest/Splashes      | `#FFFFFF` (white)                    | Frothy, irregular shapes (polygons with jagged edges); 50–70% opacity for depth.           |\n| **Water**             |                                      |                                                                                           |\n| - Calm Foreground     | `#008080` (teal) → `#00FFFF` (cyan)  | Rippled (10–15 horizontal `polyline` elements with `#008080` fill; 20–30% opacity).        |\n| - Turbulent Midground | `#008080` (teal) + `#FFFFFF` (white) | Mix of teal waves and white splashes; 80% opacity for layering.                            |\n| **Background**        | `#404040` (dark gray) → `#808080` (light gray) | Linear gradient (top to bottom); flat, no texture (focuses attention on the surfer).       |\n| **Leash**             | `#0000FF` (blue)                     | Thin, curved line (1–2px stroke width); 70% opacity (blends with water).                  |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses a **16:9 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1920x1080 pixels). All positions are relative to the image’s bounding box (0% = left/top, 100% = right/bottom).  \n\n| Element               | Position (Relative to Image)         | Z-Index (Layer Order) |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Background**        | Full width/height (0%–100%)          | 1 (bottom)            |\n| **Calm Water**        | Full width; 0%–70% height            | 2                     |\n| **Wave**              | Full width; 30%–60% height           | 3                     |\n| **Surfboard**         | 25%–75% width; 60%–70% height        | 4                     |\n| **Surfer**            | 40%–60% width; 30%–70% height        | 5 (top)               |\n| **Splashes**          | 30%–80% width; 40%–70% height        | 4.5 (between wave and surfer) |\n| **Leash**             | 50%–80% width; 65%–75% height        | 4.25 (under surfboard) |\n\n#### **Key Proportions**  \n- **Surfer**: Crouched height ≈ 30% of the image height.  \n- **Surfboard**: Length ≈ 40% of the image width (matches the surfer’s crouched height).  \n- **Wave**: Height ≈ 30% of the image (covers the surfer’s upper body).  \n- **Splashes**: Concentrated within a 20% radius of the surfboard’s tail (where the board meets the wave).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **dynamic action shot** with a focus on motion and contrast. For SVG, we need to replicate:  \n\n#### **Motion**  \n- **Wave**: Curved lines (bezier curves) to suggest forward momentum.  \n- **Splashes**: Irregular polygons (jagged edges) to mimic froth.  \n- **Surfer’s Hair**: Curved strands (polyline) to show wind/velocity.  \n\n#### **Contrast**  \n- **Surfer vs. Wave**: The purple top and black wetsuit create high contrast with the teal/cyan wave, drawing focus to the figure.  \n- **Lighting**: Subtle backlighting (wave is brighter than the background) gives the surfer a \"halo\" effect (use 10–20% opacity on the wave’s crest).  \n\n#### **Vector-Friendly Style**  \n- **Simplification**: Reduce complex details (e.g., hair strands, splashes) to 5–15 distinct shapes (avoids overcrowding the SVG).  \n- **Gradients**: Use linear/radial gradients for texture (e.g., wetsuit shine, wave volume) instead of raster effects.  \n- **Lines**: Use thin strokes (1–2px) for hair, leash, and water ripples (maintains clarity at any scale).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text/symbols are **partially visible** in the original image but critical for accuracy:  \n\n| Element               | Description                                                                 | Position (Relative to Parent) |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Surfer’s Top**      | White text on the back (e.g., \"ZIPPO\" or \"Roxy\"); 2–3 letters visible.      | 70% of the top’s height (center-right). |\n| **Wetsuit Pants**     | Small yellow logo (e.g., \"O’Neill\") on the **left thigh**; 5% of pant width. | 30% of the pant’s length (from the waist). |\n| **Surfboard Logo**    | Black stylized text (e.g., \"Vans\") on the **top-left corner**; 10% of board length. | 10% from the nose, 10% from the left edge. |\n| **Leash**             | Blue cord attached to the **right ankle**; trails 1.5x the board’s length.  | 90% from the board’s tail (attached to the surfer’s ankle). |\n\n\n### **6. SVG Layer Structure**\nTo ensure scalability and editability, the SVG should use **grouped layers** (`<g>`) with descriptive IDs. Below is a recommended hierarchy:  \n\n```xml\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 1920 1080\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Background (Gradient Sky) -->\n  <g id=\"background\">\n    <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"url(#bg-gradient)\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Calm Water (Foreground Ripples) -->\n  <g id=\"calm-water\">\n    <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"70%\" fill=\"url(#water-gradient)\"/>\n    <polyline points=\"0 800, 200 810, 400 800, 600 810, 800 800, 1000 810, 1200 800, 1400 810, 1600 800, 1800 810, 1920 800\" stroke=\"#008080\" stroke-width=\"2\" opacity=\"0.2\"/>\n    <!-- Repeat 10–15 ripples with varying Y-positions -->\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Breaking Wave (Midground) -->\n  <g id=\"wave\">\n    <path d=\"M0 400 Q 400 300, 800 400 Q 1200 500, 1600 400 Q 1920 300, 1920 1080\" fill=\"url(#wave-gradient)\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"300 350, 400 300, 500 350, 450 370\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" opacity=\"0.6\"/>\n    <!-- Repeat 10–15 splashes with jagged edges -->\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Surfboard (Foreground) -->\n  <g id=\"surfboard\">\n    <path d=\"M250 600 Q 500 650, 900 600 Q 1150 550, 1400 600\" fill=\"url(#board-gradient)\"/>\n    <text x=\"300\" y=\"620\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\">VANS</text>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Surfer (Top Layer) -->\n  <g id=\"surfer\">\n    <!-- Head -->\n    <ellipse cx=\"600\" cy=\"300\" rx=\"30\" ry=\"40\" fill=\"#FFDAB9\"/>\n    <!-- Hair -->\n    <polyline points=\"600 260, 650 280, 700 300\" stroke=\"#FF4500\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"none\"/>\n    <!-- Torso -->\n    <path d=\"M550 350 Q 600 380, 650 350\" fill=\"#8A2BE2\"/>\n    <!-- Arms -->\n    <path d=\"M650 350 Q 700 250, 750 200\" stroke=\"#8A2BE2\" stroke-width=\"10\" fill=\"none\"/> <!-- Right arm -->\n    <path d=\"M550 350 Q 500 380, 450 400\" stroke=\"#8A2BE2\" stroke-width=\"10\" fill=\"none\"/> <!-- Left arm -->\n    <!-- Legs -->\n    <path d=\"M600 400 Q 650 500, 700 600\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"15\" fill=\"none\"/> <!-- Right leg -->\n    <path d=\"M550 400 Q 500 500, 450 600\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"15\" fill=\"none\"/> <!-- Left leg -->\n    <!-- Gloves -->\n    <circle cx=\"750\" cy=\"200\" r=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\"/> <!-- Right glove -->\n    <circle cx=\"450\" cy=\"400\" r=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\"/> <!-- Left glove -->\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Leash (Under Surfboard) -->\n  <g id=\"leash\">\n    <path d=\"M700 600 Q 800 650, 900 700\" stroke=\"#0000FF\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\" opacity=\"0.7\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Gradients (Defined in <defs>) -->\n  <defs>\n    <linearGradient id=\"bg-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#404040\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#808080\"/>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <linearGradient id=\"water-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#00FFFF\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#008080\"/>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <linearGradient id=\"wave-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#00FFFF\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#008080\"/>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <radialGradient id=\"board-gradient\" cx=\"0.5\" cy=\"0.5\" r=\"0.5\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#E0E0E0\"/>\n    </radialGradient>\n  </defs>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **7. Critical Notes for SVG Accuracy**\n- **Motion Blur**: Avoid raster blur—use **transparency** (50–70% opacity) for splashes and wave crests to mimic motion.  \n- **Proportions**: Use the surfer’s height as a reference (e.g., surfboard length = 1.5x surfer’s crouched height).  \n- **Text**: Use vector `<text>` elements for logos (not raster images) to maintain scalability.  \n- **Ripples**: Use `<polyline>` elements with varying Y-positions (10–15 per layer) for a natural water effect.  \n\nBy following this description, you can recreate a **scalable, accurate SVG** that preserves the image’s dynamic feel, color contrast, and key details.",

Textures are varied to add depth and coziness.  \n\n| Object               | Color Palette (Hex Codes)       | Texture/Visual Property                |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Sofa**             | Main: #2ECC71 (bright green)     | Soft, padded; subtle gradient (darker at creases: #27AE60) |\n|                      | Stitching: #1B5E20 (dark green)  | Fine, parallel lines                   |\n| **Houndstooth Cushion** | #000000 (black) / #FFFFFF (white) | Woven, repeating check pattern         |\n| **Peach Cushion**    | Main: #F8C471 (pale peach)       | Ribbed; diagonal repeating lines (darker: #E67E22) |\n|                      | Edges: #D35400 (burnt orange)    | Piped trim                             |\n| **Side Table Top**   | #2D3436 (dark wood)              | Matte; wood grain pattern (subtle #34495E veins) |\n| **Table Legs/Base**  | #000000 (matte black)            | Smooth, metallic                       |\n| **Prime Day Box**    | Main: #E74C3C (red)              | Glossy; stacked cubes                  |\n|                      | Text: #FFFFFF (white)            | Bold, sans-serif (e.g., Arial Black)   |\n|                      | Amazon Smile: #FF9900 (yellow)   | Curved arrow below \"DAY\"               |\n| **Lamp Shade**       | #F8F4E3 (cream)                  | Matte, conical                         |\n| **Lamp Stem**        | #F1C40F (yellow)                 | Smooth, cylindrical                    |\n| **Lamp Base**        | #E67E22 (orange)                 | Glossy, circular disc                  |\n| **Wall (Orange)**    | #E67E22 (burnt orange)           | Flat, rectangular panel (behind sofa)  |\n| **Wall (White)**     | #ECF0F1 (light gray-white)       | Flat                                   |\n| **Curtains**         | #F5F5F5 (off-white)              | Sheer, lightweight; subtle fold lines  |\n| **Window Exterior**  | #AED6F1 (pale blue)              | Blurred (simulates outdoor light)      |\n| **Rug**              | #EAEDED (light beige)            | Woven; subtle herringbone pattern (darker: #BDC3C7) |\n| **Flooring**         | #D5DBDB (light wood)             | Smooth; faint grain lines              |\n\n#### **Key Textures for SVG**  \n- **Houndstooth**: Repeating 10x10px black/white squares (scale to fit cushion).  \n- **Peach Cushion**: Repeating 2px diagonal lines (45° angle) in #E67E22 on a #F8C471 base.  \n- **Table Top**: Seamless wood grain pattern (e.g., 500x500px) with subtle knots and veins.  \n- **Sofa**: Linear gradient from #2ECC71 (center) to #27AE60 (edges) to simulate padding.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is balanced with a **left-to-right flow** (sofa → table → window). Below is a **coordinate system** (assuming the **rug’s bottom-left corner is (0,0)**) to define relative positions:  \n\n| Object               | Position (X, Y, Z) | Dimensions (W x H x D) | Notes                                  |\n|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Rug**              | (0, 0, 0)          | 800px x 500px x 1px    | Covers 80% of the floor; extends from sofa to window. |\n| **Sofa**             | (0, 100px, 0)      | 600px (width) x 400px (height) x 800px (depth) | Left edge aligned with rug’s left edge; backrest against the wall. |\n| **Side Table**       | (450px, 150px, 0)  | 300px (width) x 600px (height) x 200px (depth) | Right edge of table aligns with sofa’s armrest; top overhangs slightly. |\n| **Prime Day Box**    | (480px, 620px, 0)  | 80px x 80px x 80px (total) | Stacked 40px x 40px x 40px cubes; left of center on table. |\n| **Lamp**             | (600px, 550px, 0)  | 100px (base diameter) x 300px (height) | Right of center on table; shade tilts slightly toward window. |\n| **Window**           | (500px, 0, 0)      | 600px (width) x 800px (height) | Right of table; frame is 20px white (#FFFFFF). |\n| **Curtains**         | (500px, 0, 0)      | 200px (width) x 800px (height) each | Hang on either side of window; left curtain overlaps table slightly. |\n\n#### **Depth Cues**  \n- **Z-Axis**: Objects closer to the camera have higher **Z-values** (e.g., the sofa’s armrest is at Z=200px, the table top at Z=150px).  \n- **Shadows**: Cast from the **right** (light source = window).  \n  - **Sofa**: Shadow on the wall (#1B5E20) and floor (#BDC3C7).  \n  - **Table**: Shadow on the rug (#95A5A6) (offset 20px to the left).  \n  - **Lamp/Box**: Soft shadows on the table top (#000000, 20% opacity).  \n\n#### **Proportions**  \n- **Sofa**: Armrest height = 300px (matches table top height).  \n- **Side Table**: Height = 600px (taller than sofa’s backrest).  \n- **Lamp**: Shade diameter = 100px (1/3 of table width).  \n- **Prime Day Box**: 1/4 the table’s depth (fits comfortably without overlapping the lamp).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image follows a **modern minimalist** aesthetic with:  \n- **Clean Lines**: The table’s metal frame, sofa’s curved edges, and lamp’s conical shade use simple, geometric shapes.  \n- **Bold Colors**: High-contrast tones (green sofa, red box, orange wall) add energy; neutrals (white, beige) balance the palette.  \n- **Functional Decor**: The side table and lamp are practical; the \"Prime Day\" box adds a playful, topical touch.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused natural light from the window creates warm shadows and highlights texture (e.g., sofa’s padding, table’s wood grain).  \n\n#### **SVG Style Notes**  \n- **Layers**: Use **grouped layers** for easy editing (e.g., `sofa`, `table`, `table_items`, `background`).  \n- **Shadows**: Use **blurred rectangles** (5px Gaussian blur) with 20–30% opacity.  \n- **Curves**: The sofa’s armrest and backrest should be drawn with **bezier curves** (not straight lines) to maintain a soft, padded look.  \n- **Text**: \"Prime Day\" should be **centered** on each box; the Amazon smile should be **scaled to 50% of the box width** (under \"DAY\").  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \n- **Prime Day Box**:  \n  - Top box: \"PRIME\" (18px, bold, white, sans-serif; centered).  \n  - Bottom box: \"DAY\" (18px, bold, white, sans-serif; centered).  \n  - Amazon Smile: Yellow curved arrow (10px height) below \"DAY\"; the arrowhead points to the right.  \n\n#### **Symbols/Patterns**  \n- **Houndstooth Cushion**: Repeating 1:1 black/white check pattern (scale to 20px per square).  \n- **Peach Cushion**: Diagonal 2px lines (45° angle) spaced 10px apart (darker than the base color).  \n- **Curtains**: Subtle vertical fold lines (1px, #E0E0E0) to simulate movement.  \n\n#### **Critical Details**  \n- **Sofa Stitching**: 1px lines along the armrest and backrest edges (spacing: 20px).  \n- **Lamp Finial**: 5px yellow circle on top of the stem (centered).  \n- **Window Frame**: 20px white border (#FFFFFF) around the window; exterior is a blurred #AED6F1 rectangle.  \n- **Wall Section**: The orange wall panel is a 400px x 600px rectangle (aligned with the sofa’s backrest); upper wall is white (#ECF0F1).  \n\n\n### **SVG Production Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these steps:  \n1. **Set Up the Canvas**: 1200px (width) x 800px (height) (matches typical living room composition).  \n2. **Draw Background Elements First**: Wall (orange/white), window (frame + exterior), curtains, rug, flooring.  \n3. **Add the Sofa**: Use bezier curves for the armrest and backrest; add cushions as nested rectangles with pattern fills.  \n4. **Draw the Side Table**: Rectangle for the top (wood grain pattern), rectangles for legs (matte black), and a rectangular frame for the base.  \n5. **Add Tabletop Items**: Stacked cubes for the Prime Day box (text + Amazon smile), cone for the lamp shade, cylinder for the stem, circle for the base.  \n6. **Apply Shadows**: Use blurred rectangles (20% opacity) for each object; align shadows to the left (light source = right).  \n7. **Refine Textures**: Adjust pattern scales (e.g., houndstooth) to fit object dimensions; use gradients for the sofa to simulate padding.  \n8. **Check Proportions**: Ensure the table is taller than the sofa’s armrest, and the lamp is proportional to the table.  \n\nBy following this detailed breakdown, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s style, color, and composition—ideal for digital use or further editing.",
  "v1_133": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we’ll break down the scene into **main elements**, **geometric details**, **color/texture specifications**, **spatial relationships**, and **SVG-specific considerations**. The goal is to capture the realism of the photographic reference while ensuring precision for vector reproduction.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects & Geometric Shapes\nThe scene is a backyard corner featuring a **wooden fence**, **tree stump**, **vining plants**, and **ground cover**. Below is a breakdown of each element’s structure:\n\n### A. L-Shaped Wooden Fence\nFrames the background and side of the scene. Consists of two sections (**back** and **side**) connected by a **corner post**.  \n- **Back Section (Horizontal)**: Runs across the top 1/3 of the image.  \n  - **Vertical Slats**: 18 total (evenly spaced). Each slat is a **rectangle with a semicircular top** (width = 20px, height = 150px; semicircle radius = 10px).  \n  - **Horizontal Rails**: 2 (top/bottom). Each rail is a **rectangle** (width = 100% of image width, height = 15px) connecting the slats.  \n- **Side Section (Vertical)**: Runs along the right 1/4 of the image (from corner post to bottom edge).  \n  - **Vertical Slats**: 10 total (evenly spaced). Identical to back section slats but shorter (height = 200px).  \n  - **Horizontal Rails**: 2 (top/bottom). Each rail is a **rectangle** (width = 200px, height = 15px) connecting the slats.  \n- **Corner Post**: Thick rectangle (width = 30px, height = 150px) at the intersection of the two sections (anchors both rails/slats).  \n\n### B. Tree Stump\nThe focal point, located in the **corner formed by the fence sections**. Irregular cylindrical shape with a jagged top (from being cut).  \n- **Base**: **Oval** (width = 200px, height = 180px) to simulate foreshortening (slightly wider than tall). Centered at `(x = 75% of image width, y = 50% of image height)`.  \n- **Top Edge**: **Jagged polygon** (15–20 vertices) with random offsets (±10px) from the oval’s top edge to mimic splintered wood.  \n- **Bark Cracks**: 50–70 **irregular lines** (vertical/horizontal/diagonal) on the oval. Line width = 1–2px (dark brown) to represent deep fissures.  \n\n### C. Vining Plants\nClimb the stump and grow at its base. Features slender stems and heart-shaped leaves.  \n- **Stems**: 15–20 **curved lines** (reddish-brown, width = 1–2px). Originate from the stump’s base; some wrap around the stump (attach to bark cracks).  \n- **Leaves**: 50–70 **heart-shaped polygons** (width = 10–20px, height = 8–16px) with a pointed tip. Attached to stems in an **alternate arrangement** (one leaf per node).  \n- **Veins**: 3–5 **light green lines** (1px width) per leaf, radiating from the base (palmate pattern).  \n\n### D. Ground Cover\nFills the foreground (bottom 2/3 of the image). Mix of **live grass**, **dead grass**, **dirt**, and **dandelions**.  \n- **Live Grass**: 100–150 **fine vertical lines** (bright green, width = 1px). Blades are 5–15px long, clustered in the left/center of the image.  \n- **Dead Grass**: 20–30 **irregular polygons** (tan/brown) around the stump. Mimics matted, dry foliage.  \n- **Dirt**: 10–15 **irregular polygons** (dark brown) between grass clumps. Represents bare soil.  \n- **Dandelions**: 2–3 **yellow circles** (diameter = 5px) with 5–8 **petal lines** (yellow). Located at:  \n  - `(x = 25% of image width, y = 60% of image height)`  \n  - `(x = 95% of image width, y = 50% of image height)`  \n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures & Visual Properties\nRealism depends on matching **color values** (for consistency) and **texture patterns** (for depth). Below are specifications for each element:\n\n### A. Color Palette (Hex Codes)\n| Element               | Color (Hex)                | Notes                                  |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Fence**             | `#A67C52` (light brown)    | Weathered wood; add subtle `#E0E0E0` (white) wash for age. |\n| **Stump Bark**        | `#654321` (dark brown)     | Base color; cracks = `#331A00` (darker brown). |\n| **Stump Lichen**      | `#B8D64E` (yellow-green)   | Patchy; opacity = 70% (blends with bark). |\n| **Plant Stems**       | `#8B4513` (reddish-brown)  | Slender; add `#A0522D` (lighter brown) for highlights. |\n| **Young Leaves**      | `#8BC34A` (bright green)   | Tips of stems; vibrant to indicate new growth. |\n| **Older Leaves**      | `#388E3C` (dark green)     | Mature leaves; deeper color for contrast. |\n| **Live Grass**        | `#4CAF50` (bright green)   | Healthy blades; add `#81C784` (lighter green) for sheen. |\n| **Dead Grass**        | `#D2B48C` (tan)            | Matted; opacity = 80% (blends with dirt). |\n| **Dirt**              | `#5D4037` (dark brown)     | Bare soil; add `#795548` (lighter brown) for texture. |\n| **Shadows**           | `#424242` (dark gray)      | Semi-transparent (opacity = 30–50%); soft edges. |\n| **Dandelions**        | `#FFEB3B` (yellow)         | Bright; petals = `#FFF176` (pale yellow) for depth. |\n\n### B. Textures (SVG Pattern Fills)\nTo replicate real-world textures, use **pattern fills** for repetitive details. Below are key patterns:  \n- **Fence Wood Grain**: Horizontal lines (`#8B5E3C`; 1px width) spaced 5px apart. Apply to slats/rails.  \n- **Stump Bark**: Irregular polygons (`#654321`) with 1px `#331A00` borders (cracks). Use a **tile pattern** (20px × 20px) for consistency.  \n- **Grass Blades**: Fine vertical lines (`#4CAF50`; 1px width) spaced 2px apart. Apply to live grass clumps.  \n\n### C. Lighting & Shadows\nThe **light source is from the right**, casting shadows to the left of objects. Key shadow details:  \n- **Fence Slats**: Vertical rectangles (`#424242`; width = 10px, height = 150px) to the left of each slat. Opacity = 40%; blur = 2px (soft edges).  \n- **Stump**: Irregular polygon (`#424242`) extending left from the base. Width = 1/2 of the stump’s diameter; height = 1/3 of the stump’s height. Opacity = 50%; blur = 3px.  \n- **Plant Shadows**: Subtle `#212121` (black) lines under leaves/stems. Opacity = 20%; blur = 1px (mimics soft shade).  \n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships & Layout\nPrecise positioning ensures the scene feels balanced and realistic. Below are **relative proportions** (based on an image width `W` and height `H`):  \n\n| Element               | Position (Relative to Image)       | Size (Relative to Image)              |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Back Fence Section** | Top 1/3 of image (`y = 0` to `H/3`) | Width = `W`; height = `H/3`            |\n| **Side Fence Section** | Right 1/4 of image (`x = 80%W` to `W`) | Width = `20%W`; height = `H/2`         |\n| **Corner Post**        | `(x = 80%W, y = 0` to `H/3`)        | Width = `3%W`; height = `H/3`          |\n| **Stump**              | `(x = 75%W, y = 50%H)`              | Width = `25%W`; height = `50%H`        |\n| **Plants**             | Left/front of stump (`x = 50%W` to `80%W`, `y = 40%H` to `80%H`) | Coverage = `30%` of image area         |\n| **Live Grass**         | Left/center (`x = 0` to `50%W`, `y = 60%H` to `H`) | Coverage = `40%` of ground area        |\n| **Dead Grass**         | Around stump (`x = 60%W` to `90%W`, `y = 50%H` to `H`) | Coverage = `25%` of ground area        |\n\n### Key Spatial Rules:\n- **Depth**: Fence (background) is slightly blurred (**Gaussian blur = 2px**) compared to the sharp stump/plants (foreground).  \n- **Overlap**: Plants grow **in front of the stump** (cover 1/3 of the stump’s base).  \n- **Shadows**: Fence slat shadows are **vertical** (align with slats); stump shadow is **irregular** (follows the ground’s contour).  \n\n\n## 4. SVG-Specific Considerations\nTo ensure the SVG is **scalable** and **realistic**, follow these guidelines:\n\n### A. Layers (Organized by Depth)\nUse layers to separate elements by their position in the scene. This makes editing easier and ensures correct stacking:  \n1. **Fence** (background): Back section → side section → corner post.  \n2. **Ground** (foreground): Dirt → dead grass → live grass → dandelions.  \n3. **Stump** (middle ground): Bark → lichen → cracks.  \n4. **Plants** (foreground): Stems → leaves → veins.  \n5. **Shadows** (top layer): Fence slats → stump → plants.  \n\n### B. Precision (Vector Geometry)\n- **Fence Slats**: Use **rectangles** with **semicircular tops** (`rx = 10px`, `ry = 10px` for the top edge).  \n- **Stump Top**: Use a **polygon** with 15–20 vertices (random offsets from the oval’s top edge) to mimic a jagged cut.  \n- **Leaves**: Use **path elements** (not basic shapes) to create natural heart shapes. Example:  \n  ```svg\n  <path d=\"M100 200 Q120 180 140 200 Q130 220 110 220 Q90 220 80 200 Z\" fill=\"#388E3C\" stroke=\"#2E7D32\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  ```  \n  (This creates a heart shape with a pointed tip and curved sides.)\n\n### C. Realism (Subtle Details)\nAdd small details to enhance realism:  \n- **Leaf Curvature**: Tilt 10–15% of leaves (slightly curved edges) to mimic wind.  \n- **Bark Splinters**: Add 5–10 **tiny triangles** (`#654321`) to the stump’s top edge (splintered wood).  \n- **Grass Clumps**: Group grass blades into clusters (10–15 blades per clump) to avoid a “uniform” look.  \n- **Lichen Distribution**: Concentrate lichen on the **right side of the stump** (sunlit area); sparse on the left (shadowed).  \n\n### D. Performance (Optimization)\n- **Simplify Paths**: Use fewer vertices for large areas (e.g., ground) to reduce file size.  \n- **Reuse Patterns**: Define textures (e.g., fence grain) once and reuse them across elements.  \n- **Minimize Blur**: Use blur sparingly (only for shadows/fence) to avoid performance issues.  \n\n\n## 5. Final SVG Template (Pseudocode)\nBelow is a simplified pseudocode template to structure the SVG. Replace placeholder values (e.g., `[image width]`) with your desired dimensions (e.g., `1000px`):\n\n```svg\n<svg width=\"[image width]\" height=\"[image height]\" viewBox=\"0 0 [image width] [image height]\">\n  <!-- Background: Sky (not visible in reference, but optional) -->\n  <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#87CEEB\"/>\n\n  <!-- Layer 1: Fence (Background) -->\n  <g id=\"fence\" filter=\"url(#blur)\">\n    <!-- Back Section (Horizontal) -->\n    <g id=\"back-fence\">\n      <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"[image width]\" height=\"[H/3]\" fill=\"#A67C52\" stroke=\"#8B5E3C\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n      <!-- Vertical Slats (18 total) -->\n      <g id=\"back-slats\">\n        <rect x=\"10px\" y=\"0\" width=\"20px\" height=\"[H/3]\" rx=\"10px\" ry=\"10px\" fill=\"url(#wood-grain)\"/>\n        <!-- Repeat slats with 10px gap (x += 30px) -->\n      </g>\n      <!-- Horizontal Rails -->\n      <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"[image width]\" height=\"15px\" fill=\"#8B5E3C\"/>\n      <rect x=\"0\" y=\"[H/3 - 15px]\" width=\"[image width]\" height=\"15px\" fill=\"#8B5E3C\"/>\n    </g>\n\n    <!-- Side Section (Vertical) -->\n    <g id=\"side-fence\">\n      <rect x=\"[80%W]\" y=\"0\" width=\"[20%W]\" height=\"[H/2]\" fill=\"#A67C52\" stroke=\"#8B5E3C\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n      <!-- Vertical Slats (10 total) -->\n      <g id=\"side-slats\">\n        <rect x=\"[80%W + 10px]\" y=\"0\" width=\"20px\" height=\"[H/2]\" rx=\"10px\" ry=\"10px\" fill=\"url(#wood-grain)\"/>\n        <!-- Repeat slats with 10px gap (x += 30px) -->\n      </g>\n      <!-- Horizontal Rails -->\n      <rect x=\"[80%W]\" y=\"0\" width=\"[20%W]\" height=\"15px\" fill=\"#8B5E3C\"/>\n      <rect x=\"[80%W]\" y=\"[H/2 - 15px]\" width=\"[20%W]\" height=\"15px\" fill=\"#8B5E3C\"/>\n    </g>\n\n    <!-- Corner Post -->\n    <rect x=\"[80%W]\" y=\"0\" width=\"30px\" height=\"[H/3]\" fill=\"#8B5E3C\" stroke=\"#654321\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Layer 2: Ground (Foreground) -->\n  <g id=\"ground\">\n    <!-- Live Grass (Clumps) -->\n    <g id=\"live-grass\" fill=\"#4CAF50\" stroke=\"#81C784\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n      <line x1=\"10px\" y1=\"[60%H]\" x2=\"10px\" y2=\"[H]\"/>\n      <!-- Repeat 100-150 lines in left/center -->\n    </g>\n\n    <!-- Dead Grass (Matted) -->\n    <g id=\"dead-grass\" fill=\"#D2B48C\" opacity=\"80%\">\n      <polygon points=\"600,600 700,650 650,700 550,680\"/>\n      <!-- Repeat 20-30 irregular polygons -->\n    </g>\n\n    <!-- Dirt (Bare Soil) -->\n    <g id=\"dirt\" fill=\"#5D4037\" opacity=\"90%\">\n      <polygon points=\"200,700 300,750 250,800 150,780\"/>\n      <!-- Repeat 10-15 irregular polygons -->\n    </g>\n\n    <!-- Dandelions -->\n    <g id=\"dandelions\">\n      <circle cx=\"250\" cy=\"600\" r=\"5px\" fill=\"#FFEB3B\"/>\n      <line x1=\"250\" y1=\"600\" x2=\"260\" y2=\"605\" stroke=\"#FFF176\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n      <!-- Add 5-8 petal lines per dandelion -->\n    </g>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Layer 3: Stump (Middle Ground) -->\n  <g id=\"stump\">\n    <!-- Base Oval -->\n    <ellipse cx=\"[75%W]\" cy=\"[50%H]\" rx=\"100px\" ry=\"90px\" fill=\"url(#bark-pattern)\"/>\n    <!-- Top Jagged Edge -->\n    <polygon points=\"650,300 670,280 700,290 730,270 760,280 790,300\" fill=\"#654321\" stroke=\"#331A00\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n    <!-- Lichen Patches -->\n    <g id=\"lichen\" fill=\"#B8D64E\" opacity=\"70%\">\n      <circle cx=\"[75%W + 50px]\" cy=\"[50%H - 30px]\" r=\"20px\"/>\n      <!-- Repeat 20-30 circles/irregular shapes on right side -->\n    </g>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Layer 4: Plants (Foreground) -->\n  <g id=\"plants\">\n    <!-- Stems (Curved) -->\n    <g id=\"stems\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\">\n      <path d=\"M600,600 Q550,500 650,400\"/>\n      <!-- Repeat 15-20 curved paths -->\n    </g>\n\n    <!-- Leaves (Heart-Shaped) -->\n    <g id=\"leaves\" fill=\"#388E3C\" stroke=\"#2E7D32\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n      <path d=\"M650,400 Q670,380 690,400 Q680,420 660,420 Q640,420 630,400 Z\" fill=\"#8BC34A\"/>\n      <!-- Repeat 50-70 paths;

Final Notes for Accuracy\n- **Test Scaling**: Ensure all elements (e.g., fence slats, grass blades) retain their proportions when the SVG is resized.  \n- **Adjust Opacity**: Fine-tune shadow/lichen opacity to match the photographic reference (e.g., lichen should blend with bark, not overpower it).  \n- **Add Details**: Include subtle touches like **leaf veins**, **bark cracks**, and **grass blade curvature** to enhance realism.  \n\nThis template provides a foundation for recreating the image as an SVG. By following the **geometric specifications**, **color palette**, and **spatial rules**, you’ll achieve a realistic, scalable vector version of the original scene.",
  "v1_134": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, geometrically precise description of all elements, including proportions, positioning, textures, and stylistic choices. The description assumes a **coordinate system** where the wooden surface spans from `(0,0)` (bottom-left corner) to `(10,7)` (top-right corner) in arbitrary units (scalable for SVG).\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image features four key components: a **stainless steel spoon**, a **pair of stainless steel chopsticks**, a **wooden serving board**, and a **bunch of white flowers**. Each element is described below with geometric precision:\n\n### A. Stainless Steel Spoon\n- **Overall Shape**: Long, slender utensil with a large, concave bowl and a flat handle.  \n- **Bowl**:  \n  - **Geometry**: A truncated teardrop (oval with a rounded tip) in top view, concave to create depth.  \n  - **Dimensions**: 2.2 units wide (max at the midpoint), 1.6 units tall (from top edge to base of the bowl).  \n  - **Edge**: Slightly thicker (0.1 units) than the center, with a smooth, rounded rim.  \n- **Handle**:  \n  - **Geometry**: Flat rectangular bar with rounded top/bottom edges (cross-section: rectangle with 0.3 unit width, 0.1 unit thickness, rounded corners).  \n  - **Dimensions**: 5.8 units long (from base of the bowl to end of the handle), 0.3 units wide.  \n  - **Decorative Motif**: A small clover (three leaves + stem) located **1 unit from the handle’s end** (1/6 of the handle length from the tip). The clover is 0.2 units tall/wide.\n\n### B. Stainless Steel Chopsticks (Pair)\n- **Overall Shape**: Two thin, rectangular rods with rounded edges (cross-section: rectangle with 0.2 unit width, 0.1 unit thickness, rounded corners).  \n- **Dimensions per Chopstick**: 7.0 units long, 0.2 units wide.  \n- **Alignment**: Parallel to each other, with the **top chopstick slightly shifted right** (0.1 units) at the tip for a natural, used look.  \n- **Decorative Motif**: Each chopstick has a clover (identical to the spoon’s but smaller: 0.15 units tall/wide) located **0.7 units from the thicker end** (1/10 of the length from the handle end).  \n- **Tip vs. Handle End**: The **tips** (narrow, unadorned ends) point toward the top-right corner; the **handle ends** (thicker, decorated ends) rest near the bottom-right corner.\n\n### C. Wooden Serving Board\n- **Geometry**: Flat, rectangular plank with a slight bevel (0.2 units thick) along the front edge (bottom edge in the coordinate system) for depth.  \n- **Dimensions**: 10 units wide (horizontal), 7 units tall (vertical).  \n- **Watermark**: A faint, circular logo in the **center-left** (`(3,4)`), 2 units in diameter. The logo consists of:  \n  - A horizontal line through the circle’s center.  \n  - Two curved lines (resembling petals or a \"K\") on either side of the horizontal line.  \n  - **Opacity**: 10–15% (very subtle).\n\n### D. White Flower Bunch\n- **Geometry**: Cluster of 8–10 overlapping petals (teardrop-shaped, with rounded tips) arranged in a loose bouquet.  \n- **Petals**: Each petal is a curved oval (0.8 units long, 0.5 units wide) with a slightly pointed base.  \n- **Arrangement**: Petals overlap in a random, natural pattern, with the densest cluster in the **top-right corner** (`(8.5,5.5)`).\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nAll elements have realistic textures and color palettes consistent with a product photo:\n\n### A. Stainless Steel Utensils (Spoon + Chopsticks)\n- **Base Color**: Metallic silver (`#C0C0C0`).  \n- **Texture**: Highly reflective (mirror-like) with subtle brushed metal grain (thin, horizontal lines) on the handles.  \n- **Highlights**:  \n  - **Spoon Bowl**: A bright white oval (`#FFFFFF`) in the top-left quadrant of the bowl (1.0 unit wide, 0.5 units tall) to simulate light reflection.  \n  - **Handle Edges**: Thin white lines (`#FFFFFF`) along the top edges of the spoon handle and chopsticks to emphasize curvature.  \n- **Shadows**: Soft gray (`#808080`) shadows cast to the **bottom-right** (consistent with a top-left light source):  \n  - **Spoon**: Shadow of the bowl (`(2.0,1.6)` to `(3.0,2.5)`) and a thin line along the handle (`(2.5,1.7)` to `(6.6,6.6)`).  \n  - **Chopsticks**: Shadows under each chopstick, 0.1 units offset from the utensil (e.g., top chopstick shadow: `(3.6,6.7)` to `(8.6,1.6)`).\n\n### B. Wooden Serving Board\n- **Base Color**: Warm light brown (`#D2B48C`) with subtle darker streaks (`#A0522D`) for wood grain.  \n- **Texture**: Natural wood grain (horizontal lines of varying thickness and opacity) to mimic oak or maple.  \n- **Bevel**: The front edge (bottom) has a darker brown (`#8B4513`) gradient to add depth.\n\n### C. White Flowers\n- **Base Color**: Matte white (`#F5F5F5`) with faint gray veining (`#D3D3D3`) on each petal (thin lines from the base to the tip).  \n- **Texture**: Soft, velvety matte finish with no reflection.  \n- **Shadows**: Light gray (`#E0E0E0`) shadows between overlapping petals to create depth.\n\n### D. Background\n- **Wooden Board**: The only background element; no additional scenery.\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nAll elements are arranged on the wooden board with realistic depth and overlap:\n\n### A. Utensil Placement\n- **Spoon**:  \n  - **Bowl**: Centered at `(1.5,1.5)` (top-left of the board).  \n  - **Handle**: Extends diagonally to the bottom-right, with the end at `(6.5,6.5)`.  \n  - **Angle**: 45° from the horizontal (leaning right).  \n- **Chopsticks**:  \n  - **Top Chopstick**: Tip at `(8.5,1.5)`, handle end at `(3.5,6.5)`.  \n  - **Bottom Chopstick**: Tip at `(8.4,1.4)`, handle end at `(3.4,6.4)` (0.1 units offset left/down for natural alignment).  \n  - **Angle**: 50° from the horizontal (parallel to the spoon but slightly steeper).  \n- **Overlap**: Chopsticks are **to the right** of the spoon, with their tips partially hidden under the flower bunch.\n\n### B. Flower Bunch\n- **Position**: Covers the top-right corner (`(7.0,4.0)` to `(10.0,7.0)`).  \n- **Overlap**: Petals overlap the tips of the chopsticks (utensils are under the flowers).\n\n### C. Wooden Board\n- **Bevel**: The front edge (bottom) is closer to the viewer, creating a subtle 3D effect.  \n- **Watermark**: Faint and unobtrusive, located behind the spoon handle.\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe image follows a **minimalist product photography style** with a focus on clarity and realism:\n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the **top-left** (creates gentle highlights and shadows without harsh contrasts).  \n- **Perspective**: Slightly angled (bird’s-eye view) to show the board’s depth while keeping the utensils flat.  \n- **Composition**: Rule of thirds—spoon bowl at `(1/3,1/3)`, flower bunch at `(2/3,2/3)`—to balance the frame.  \n- **Depth of Field**: Shallow (blur-free) to keep all elements in focus (typical for product shots).\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Watermark**: As described in Section 1.C, a faint circular logo with a horizontal line and curved accents. It is **not text** but a decorative symbol.  \n- **Utensil Details**:  \n  - **Spoon Bowl**: Concave with a 0.1 unit thick rim (thicker than the center).  \n  - **Chopsticks**: Rectangular cross-section with rounded corners (0.2 units wide, 0.1 units thick).  \n  - **Decorative Motifs**: Clover shapes (three leaves + stem) on the spoon handle (1 unit from the end) and chopsticks (0.7 units from the handle end).  \n- **Flower Details**: Each petal has a 0.05 unit thick gray vein (`#D3D3D3`) running from the base to the tip to add texture.\n\n\n## SVG Recreation Guidelines\nTo accurately reproduce the image as an SVG, use the following technical specifications:\n- **Coordinate System**: Use the `(0,0)` (bottom-left) to `(10,7)` (top-right) system for consistency.  \n- **Shapes**:  \n  - **Spoon Bowl**: Use a `path` element with a concave arc for the bowl and a straight line for the base.  \n  - **Handle**: Use a `rect` element with `rx=\"0.1\"` (rounded corners) for the spoon handle; `rect` elements with `rx=\"0.05\"` for chopsticks.  \n  - **Flowers**: Use `path` elements for each petal (teardrop shape) with `fill=\"#F5F5F5\"` and `stroke=\"#D3D3D3\"` (veins).  \n- **Textures**:  \n  - **Wood Grain**: Use a `pattern` element with horizontal lines of varying opacity (`#A0522D`) for the board.  \n  - **Stainless Steel**: Use a `linearGradient` for the spoon bowl highlight and `stroke` for handle grain.  \n- **Shadows**: Use `filter` elements (e.g., `feDropShadow`) with `dx=\"0.1\"`, `dy=\"0.1\"`, and `stdDeviation=\"0.2\"` for soft shadows.  \n- **Watermark**: Use a `circle` element with `fill=\"#808080\"` and `opacity=\"0.1\"` for the base, plus `line` elements for the horizontal and curved accents.\n\n\nThis description provides all the geometric, color, and compositional details needed to recreate the image as a precise SVG. Adjustments to unit scale (e.g., converting to pixels) can be made without altering the proportions or relationships between elements.",
  "v1_135": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description organizes elements by **main objects**, **colors/textures**, **spatial relationships**, **style**, and **key details**, with a focus on geometric precision, proportions, and layout.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a pastoral scene centered on a child flying a kite. Key elements (from foreground to background) include:  \n- **Child**: Standing in the lower third of the image, mid-jump with a dynamic, balanced pose.  \n- **Kite**: Flying in the upper right, attached to a spool in the child’s hand (string not visible in the original image).  \n- **Field**: A vast expanse of tall grass occupying the lower 2/3 of the image.  \n- **Hedgerow**: A dense, horizontal band of shrubs separating the field from the background.  \n- **Distant Trees**: A dark, linear grove along the horizon.  \n- **Sky**: A soft, cloud-dappled expanse filling the upper 1/3 of the image.  \n\n\n#### **Child (Central Focal Point)**\nThe child is the visual anchor, with a pose that conveys movement:  \n- **Body**: Lean, upright, with:  \n  - **Right arm**: Fully extended upward, holding a small green kite spool (cylindrical with a handle).  \n  - **Left arm**: Outstretched to the side, slightly bent at the elbow (balance).  \n  - **Legs**: In a mid-jump stance:  \n    - **Right leg**: Bent at the knee (90° angle), foot pointing downward (off the ground).  \n    - **Left leg**: Straight, angled backward (off the ground), heel lifted.  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - **Shirt**: Short-sleeved, loose-fitting, white.  \n  - **Jeans**: Dark gray/black, straight-leg, slightly baggy at the knees.  \n  - **Sneakers**: White, low-top, with black laces (visible on the left foot; right foot is partially obscured).  \n- **Hair**: Light brown, braided (single braid over the right shoulder, from the viewer’s perspective).  \n- **Face**: Round, smiling, with open eyes and a wide grin (facing upward toward the kite).  \n\n#### **Kite**\nThe kite has a geometric, multi-section design with a tail:  \n- **Main Body**: A composite shape consisting of:  \n  - **Upper Section**: A large, upward-pointing triangle (base width ≈ 2x height) in **bright green**. A smaller, inverted yellow triangle (1/3 the size of the green section) is centered within it, creating a \"window\" effect.  \n  - **Middle Section**: A rectangular band (width = green triangle base, height = 1/4 green triangle height) in **medium blue**, attached to the bottom of the green section.  \n- **Tail**: A **bright red** extension from the blue section, consisting of **three tapering streamers** (each ~2x the length of the blue section). The streamers are parallel but slightly separated, with rounded tips.  \n- **Frame**: Thin, black outlines defining each section (visible in the original image as subtle edges).  \n\n#### **Field**\nA flat, expansive plane of tall grass covering the lower 2/3 of the image. The grass is rendered as:  \n- **Foreground**: Dense, wavy clumps with irregular, vertical lines (to suggest texture).  \n- **Midground**: Gradually lighter and less detailed, merging into the hedgerow.  \n\n#### **Hedgerow**\nA continuous, horizontal band of dense shrubs running across the **midpoint** of the image (separating the field from the background). The shrubs are:  \n- Shaped as irregular, rounded mounds (varying in height from 1/8 to 1/4 the image height).  \n- Clustered tightly, with no gaps between them.  \n\n#### **Distant Trees**\nA dark, linear grove along the **horizon line** (top of the hedgerow). The trees are:  \n- Rendered as a single, solid dark green band (no individual details, to suggest depth).  \n- Straight and uniform, with a slight curve to follow the field’s perspective.  \n\n#### **Sky**\nA soft, gradient expanse filling the upper 1/3 of the image. The sky includes:  \n- **Horizon**: Light blue, merging with the field.  \n- **Upper Sky**: Pale gray, with subtle, wispy clouds (rendered as translucent, irregular shapes).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are flat or gradient (no photo-realistic textures, to suit SVG’s vector nature). Key palettes:  \n\n| Element               | Color (Hex/Description)       | Texture/Visual Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Child’s Shirt**     | #FFFFFF (pure white)           | Smooth, matte finish; no wrinkles (simplified for SVG).                              |\n| **Child’s Jeans**     | #2D2D2D (dark gray)            | Slight denim texture (subtle diagonal lines).                                        |\n| **Child’s Sneakers**  | #FFFFFF (white) + #000000 (black laces) | Smooth, with a small black sole.                                                     |\n| **Child’s Hair**      | #8B5A2B (light brown)          | Braided texture (subtle vertical lines).                                             |\n| **Kite (Green Section)** | #32CD32 (lime green)         | Matte, with a #FFFF00 (yellow) triangle in the center (1/3 the size of the green section). |\n| **Kite (Blue Section)** | #1E90FF (sky blue)            | Smooth, matte finish.                                                                |\n| **Kite (Tail)**       | #FF0000 (bright red)           | Thin, flowing; streamers have a slight gradient (darker at the base, lighter at the tip). |\n| **Field (Foreground)**| #2E8B57 (sea green)            | Wavy, vertical lines (1–2px thick) to suggest grass blades.                          |\n| **Field (Midground)** | #3CB371 (medium green)         | Lighter than foreground; fewer texture lines.                                        |\n| **Hedgerow**          | #228B22 (forest green)         | Irregular, rounded mounds with subtle texture (horizontal lines).                    |\n| **Distant Trees**     | #006400 (dark green)           | Solid, flat color (no texture).                                                      |\n| **Sky (Horizon)**     | #87CEEB (light sky blue)       | Gradient from #87CEEB (bottom) to #D3D3D3 (top).                                     |\n| **Sky (Clouds)**      | #F0F0F0 (pale gray)            | Translucent (50% opacity); irregular, wispy shapes (no hard edges).                  |\n| **Kite Spool**        | #32CD32 (lime green)           | Small, cylindrical (1/16 the child’s height); handle is a thin black line.           |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout follows **linear perspective**, with the field receding toward the horizon. Key proportions and positions:  \n\n| Element               | Position (Relative to Image) | Proportion (Image Height/Width) |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Child**             | Centered horizontally; lower 1/3 | Height: 1/3 the image height; Width: 1/6 the image width. |\n| **Kite**              | Upper right (1/4 from top, 3/4 from left) | Height: 1/8 the image height; Width: 1/6 the image width. |\n| **Hedgerow**          | Midpoint (1/2 from top)       | Height: 1/8 the image height; Width: 100% (full image width). |\n| **Distant Trees**     | Horizon line (top of hedgerow) | Height: 1/16 the image height; Width: 100%. |\n| **Sky**               | Upper 1/3                     | Height: 1/3 the image height; Width: 100%. |\n\n#### **Pose and Alignment**\n- The child’s **right arm** (holding the spool) is fully extended upward (90° from the body).  \n- The child’s **left arm** is outstretched to the side (45° from the body), slightly bent at the elbow.  \n- The child’s **right leg** (bent) is positioned directly below the raised arm (balance).  \n- The kite is **aligned diagonally** (top-left to bottom-right) relative to the child, with the tail pointing to the right (wind direction).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe SVG should adopt a **simplified, semi-realistic style** (avoiding photo-realism) with:  \n- **Clean Lines**: All elements have crisp, black outlines (1–2px thick) to define shapes (e.g., the kite’s sections, the child’s clothing).  \n- **Gradients**: Used for the sky (vertical gradient from light blue to pale gray) and grass (foreground to midground).  \n- **Flat Colors**: Dominant for solid elements (child’s shirt, jeans, kite sections) to keep the SVG lightweight.  \n- **Perspective**: Subtle (field receding, hedgerow/trees narrowing) to create depth without complexity.  \n\n\n### **5. Key Details for SVG Reproduction**\nThese details are critical for accuracy and must be included:  \n\n#### **Child**\n- **Braid**: Located on the **right shoulder** (viewer’s perspective), with a small, loose end.  \n- **Facial Features**: Simplified (no detailed eyes/eyebrows); a curved line for the smile and two dots for eyes.  \n- **Spool**: Held in the **right hand** (palm up), with a small, circular handle (1/4 the spool’s size).  \n\n#### **Kite**\n- **Yellow Triangle**: Centered in the green section, with a 1px black outline.  \n- **Tail Streamers**: Three in total, each 1/2 the kite’s height; spaced 1/16 the kite’s width apart.  \n- **Frame**: Thin black lines (1px) around each section (green, blue, tail).  \n\n#### **Field**\n- **Grass Texture**: Foreground grass uses **irregular vertical lines** (1px thick, #1E5C1E dark green) spaced 2–3px apart.  \n- **Perspective**: The field narrows slightly toward the horizon (10% reduction in width from foreground to midground).  \n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Clouds**: Three to five translucent shapes (10–20% opacity) in the upper right (near the kite).  \n- **Gradient**: Linear, from #87CEEB (horizon) to #D3D3D3 (top), with a 45° angle (to suggest soft light).  \n\n#### **Hedgerow**\n- **Shape**: Irregular, with peaks and valleys (varying height by 1/16 the image height).  \n- **Color**: #228B22 (forest green) with a 10% lighter gradient on the top (to suggest sunlight).  \n\n\n### **Summary of Layout**\n| Layer (Foreground to Background) | Element               | Position/Size Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 (Foreground)                    | Child                 | Centered, lower 1/3; 1/3 image height.                                              |\n| 2                                 | Field (Foreground)    | Full width; lower 2/3; dense texture.                                               |\n| 3                                 | Field (Midground)     | Full width; lower 1/3 to midpoint; lighter texture.                                  |\n| 4                                 | Hedgerow              | Full width; midpoint; 1/8 image height.                                              |\n| 5                                 | Distant Trees         | Full width; horizon line; 1/16 image height.                                         |\n| 6 (Background)                    | Sky                   | Full width; upper 1/3; gradient + clouds.                                            |\n| 7 (Overlap)                       | Kite                  | Upper right; 1/8 image height; diagonal alignment.                                   |\n\n\n### **Final Notes for SVG**\n- **Outlines**: Use 1px black strokes for all elements (except the sky/clouds).  \n- **Groups**: Organize elements into layers (e.g., `child`, `kite`, `field`, `sky`) for easy editing.  \n- **Textures**: Use pattern fills for grass (vertical lines) and denim (diagonal lines) to keep the SVG scalable.  \n- **Optimization**: Avoid complex clipping masks; use simple shapes (rectangles, triangles) for most elements.  \n\nThis description provides all the geometric, color, and layout details needed to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG.",
  "v1_136": "To recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed breakdown of **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** is essential. The description prioritizes geometric precision, proportional accuracy, and textural cues to ensure fidelity to the original.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects & Shapes**\nThe image features **five standing people** centered against a two-tone wall with a decorative border and an abstract mural. Key elements include:\n\n#### **People (Left to Right)**\nEach person is grouped into **head, torso, arms, legs, and clothing**. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder, with casual, friendly postures (arms around neighbors, relaxed hands).  \n- **Person 1 (Light Blue Shirt)**: Red hair (short, side-swept), light blue button-up shirt (rolled to elbows, left chest pocket), brown straight-leg pants. Left hand hangs; right arm wraps around Person 2’s shoulders.  \n- **Person 2 (Brown Top)**: Curly dark hair (short, messy), round thin-rimmed glasses, brown half-zip top (loose fit), tan straight-leg pants. Left hand rests on Person 3’s arm; right hand hangs. Wears a black leather wristband on the left wrist.  \n- **Person 3 (White Shirt)**: Bald, rectangular thick-rimmed glasses, white mandarin-collar button-up (loose fit, untucked), dark slim-leg pants. Arms wrap around Person 2 (left) and Person 4 (right).  \n- **Person 4 (Green Shirt)**: Long bright red hair (straight, shoulder-length), green button-up (loose fit, two chest pockets, rolled cuffs), light straight-leg pants. Right hand tucked into front pocket; left arm hangs.  \n- **Person 5 (Maroon Polo)**: Curly black hair (short afro), rectangular thin-rimmed glasses, maroon three-button polo (regular fit, untucked), dark slim-leg pants. Right arm wraps around Person 4’s shoulders; left hand hangs.  \n\n#### **Wall**\n- **Upper Section**: Dark blue (80% of wall height), with an abstract black mural (centered, resembles a human figure in motion—arms raised, legs bent).  \n- **Lower Section**: Light yellow (20% of wall height), separated from the upper section by a **rope trim** (thin, horizontal, twisted texture).  \n\n#### **Mural**\nAn abstract black shape (centered behind Person 3) with soft, painterly edges. It suggests a dynamic figure (e.g., dancer, athlete) with overlapping curves for limbs and a rounded torso.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, & Visual Properties**\nThe palette balances **cool tones** (dark blue, light blue, green) with **warm tones** (brown, maroon, red, yellow), anchored by the neutral white shirt in the center. Textures are casual and tactile:  \n\n| Element               | Color                  | Texture/Visual Cue                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Wall (Upper)**      | #1E2A38 (dark blue)    | Subtle brushed gradient (lighter at top, darker at bottom) for depth.             |\n| **Wall (Lower)**      | #F7E6A3 (pale yellow)  | Smooth, matte finish.                                                             |\n| **Rope Trim**         | #8B6F47 (tan)          | Twisted/striated texture (use a dashed stroke with round caps in SVG).            |\n| **Mural**             | #000000 (black)        | Soft, diffused edges (use a path with 10–15% opacity for depth).                  |\n| **Person 1**          | Hair: #D95F5F (red)    | Shirt: #8ECAE6 (light blue, linen texture—subtle vertical folds).                 |\n|                       | Pants: #8B5E3C (brown) | Smooth, with faint creases at knees.                                              |\n| **Person 2**          | Hair: #2F2F2F (black)  | Top: #8D7B68 (brown, cotton texture—loose folds at cuffs).                        |\n|                       | Pants: #D2B48C (tan)   | Wristband: #000000 (black, leather—shiny highlight).                              |\n| **Person 3**          | Shirt: #FFFFFF (white) | Loose fit—deep folds at waist (untucked) and shoulders.                           |\n|                       | Pants: #2F2F2F (black) | Slim fit—sharp creases at ankles.                                                  |\n| **Person 4**          | Hair: #E63946 (red)    | Shirt: #2A9D8F (green, corduroy texture—thick vertical ribs).                    |\n|                       | Pants: #F0E68C (khaki) | Straight fit—soft folds at hips.                                                  |\n| **Person 5**          | Hair: #000000 (black)  | Polo: #7B3F00 (maroon, ribbed texture—horizontal lines at collar).                |\n|                       | Pants: #4B0082 (indigo) | Slim fit—smooth, with faint creases at knees.                                     |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships & Positioning**\nThe composition is **centered and symmetrical**, with the five people occupying 70% of the image height. Key proportional rules:  \n\n#### **Horizontal Layout**\n- **Total Width**: ~1.5x the height (standard photo aspect ratio).  \n- **People**: Centered horizontally, with equal spacing (1–2% of image width) between shoulders.  \n- **Wall**: Extends full width; the rope trim runs **horizontally** at 80% of the wall height (separating dark blue from pale yellow).  \n\n#### **Vertical Layout**\n- **People Height**:  \n  - Person 5 (tallest): ~100% of the group height.  \n  - Person 3: ~95% (slightly shorter than Person 5).  \n  - Person 1: ~90%.  \n  - Person 4: ~85%.  \n  - Person 2 (shortest): ~80%.  \n- **Wall Sections**:  \n  - Upper (dark blue): 80% of image height (from top to rope trim).  \n  - Lower (pale yellow): 20% (from rope trim to bottom).  \n\n#### **Depth & Overlap**\n- **Foreground**: People (fully opaque, with soft shadows on the wall behind them).  \n- **Background**: Wall (mural is semi-transparent to avoid competing with the foreground).  \n- **Shadows**: Subtle, soft shadows behind each person—darker for taller individuals (Person 5, Person 3).  \n\n\n### **4. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **contemporary, documentary-style aesthetic** with:  \n- **Casual Realism**: Clothing fits (loose/regular) and postures (relaxed arms, smiling) convey informality.  \n- **Textural Diversity**:  \n  - **Clothing**: Linen (Person 1), cotton (Person 2), corduroy (Person 4), ribbed knit (Person 5).  \n  - **Wall**: Brushed texture (dark blue) vs. smooth (pale yellow).  \n  - **Hair**: Curly (Person 2, 5), straight (Person 1, 4), bald (Person 3).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, front-facing light with subtle highlights (e.g., on Person 3’s white shirt, Person 4’s green pockets).  \n- **Mural**: Abstract, painterly (soft edges, minimal detail) to keep focus on the people.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Critical for SVG)**\nTo capture the image’s personality, the following details must be precise:  \n\n#### **Clothing**\n- **Buttons**:  \n  - Person 1 (light blue): 4 buttons (top to bottom, all fastened except the collar).  \n  - Person 3 (white): 5 buttons (all fastened except the top two).  \n  - Person 4 (green): 3 buttons (top to bottom, all fastened).  \n  - Person 5 (maroon): 3 buttons (top two fastened, bottom unfastened).  \n- **Pockets**:  \n  - Person 1: Left chest pocket (rectangular, 1/3 the width of the shirt).  \n  - Person 4: Two chest pockets (rectangular, 1/4 the width of the shirt, each with a button).  \n- **Cuffs**:  \n  - Person 1: Shirt rolled to elbows (1.5x the width of the forearm).  \n  - Person 2: Top cuffed once (loose, 1x the width of the wrist).  \n  - Person 4: Shirt rolled to elbows (tight, 2x the width of the forearm).  \n\n#### **Facial Features**\n- **Eyes**:  \n  - Person 1: Small, almond-shaped (blue, with a white highlight).  \n  - Person 2: Round (brown, thick glasses).  \n  - Person 3: Rectangular (brown, thick black frames).  \n  - Person 4: Almond-shaped (green, no glasses).  \n  - Person 5: Rectangular (brown, thin metal frames).  \n- **Mouths**: All smiling (curved upward), with:  \n  - Person 1: Wide grin (露出 teeth).  \n  - Person 2: Medium smile (closed lips).  \n  - Person 3: Wide grin (露出 teeth).  \n  - Person 4: Medium smile (closed lips).  \n  - Person 5: Wide grin (露出 teeth).  \n- **Glasses**:  \n  - Person 2: Round, thin black frames (sits low on the nose).  \n  - Person 3: Rectangular, thick black frames (sits high on the nose).  \n  - Person 5: Rectangular, thin silver frames (sits mid-nose).  \n\n#### **Accessories**\n- **Person 2**: Black leather wristband (10px wide, 2px thick) on the left wrist (rests on Person 3’s arm).  \n- **Person 5**: Polo collar (15px tall, ribbed texture).  \n\n#### **Hair**\n- **Person 1**: Red, short (covers ears), side-swept to the right.  \n- **Person 2**: Curly dark hair (covers ears), messy top.  \n- **Person 3**: Bald (smooth, no stubble).  \n- **Person 4**: Long red hair (straight, shoulder-length, parts in the middle).  \n- **Person 5**: Curly black hair (short afro, 20px tall).  \n\n#### **Wall & Mural**\n- **Rope Trim**: A thin (5px) horizontal path with a **twisted texture** (use a dashed stroke: `stroke-dasharray=\"5,2\"` with round caps).  \n- **Mural**: A complex path (centered behind Person 3) with:  \n  - A large, curved shape (torso) with two overlapping arcs (arms).  \n  - Soft edges (use `filter: blur(2px)` in SVG).  \n  - 10–15% opacity to avoid overwhelming the foreground.  \n\n\n### **6. SVG Technical Notes**\nTo ensure scalability and accuracy:  \n- **Groups**: Organize each person into `<g>` elements (e.g., `<g id=\"person1\">` with sub-groups for `head`, `torso`, `arms`).  \n- **Paths**: Use Bezier curves for organic shapes (hair, clothing folds, mural).  \n- **Gradients**:  \n  - Dark blue wall: Linear gradient (`#1E2A38` at top, `#0F172A` at bottom) for depth.  \n  - Clothing folds: Radial gradients (darker in creases, lighter on highlights).  \n- **Textures**:  \n  - Use `pattern` elements for ribbed knit (Person 5) or corduroy (Person 4).  \n  - For curly hair (Person 2, 5), add subtle lines (`stroke-width: 1px`) to mimic texture.  \n- **Shadows**: Use `<filter id=\"shadow\">` with `feDropShadow` (offset: `2px 2px`, blur: `4px`, color: `#000000` at 30% opacity).  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key Proportions (for SVG Grids)**\nAssume a **1000px x 667px canvas** (16:9 ratio). Critical measurements:  \n- **People**: Total width = 800px (centered), height = 600px (bottom-aligned to the pale yellow wall).  \n- **Wall**:  \n  - Dark blue: 1000px x 534px (top to 534px).  \n  - Pale yellow: 1000px x 133px (534px to 667px).  \n  - Rope trim: 1000px x 5px (y=534px).  \n- **Mural**: 400px x 300px (centered at x=500px, y=250px).  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s warmth, casualness, and visual balance.",
  "v1_137": "To facilitate accurate SVG recreation, this description breaks down the image into **main objects, colors/textures, spatial relationships, style, and precise details**—with a focus on geometric proportions, layout, and visual properties critical for replication.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **naturalistic diorama** (likely a museum exhibit) set in a snowy winter landscape. The foreground and middle ground are dominated by two taxidermied animals, with a painted backdrop extending to the horizon. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground Animals**\n- **Deer (Male, likely a sika or red deer)**:  \n  - Streamlined, elongated body with a slightly arched back (leaping posture).  \n  - **Antlers**: Symmetrical, branching from a central beam. The left antler has 5 tines; the right has 6 (counted from the base). Antlers are thick at the base, tapering to points.  \n  - **Limbs**: Front legs raised high (knees bent), back legs pushing off the snow (hooves visible).  \n  - **Tail**: Short, tufted, and held horizontally.  \n\n- **Siberian Tiger**:  \n  - Muscular, low-slung body with a broad head.  \n  - **Stripes**: Bold, black stripes on an orange coat. Pattern:  \n    - **Body**: 7–8 vertical stripes on the back; 5–6 diagonal stripes on the sides.  \n    - **Legs**: 3–4 horizontal stripes per leg (thinner than body stripes).  \n    - **Face**: 2 vertical stripes from each eye to the mouth; 1 central stripe between the eyes.  \n  - **Posture**: Stalking—front paws raised, back legs planted, head turned sharply toward the deer.  \n  - **Tail**: Long, thick, and striped (black tip).  \n\n- **Bird (Magpie)**:  \n  - Small, agile bird in flight (top-right corner).  \n  - **Wings**: Spread wide, with primary feathers fanned.  \n  - **Shape**: Compact body with a short tail.  \n\n#### **Foreground Vegetation**\n- **Bare Branches**: 3–4 thin, grayish-brown branches crossing diagonally from the bottom left to the middle of the image. Some branches have tiny snow clumps on their tips.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground**\n- **Frozen River**: A horizontal, rectangular band spanning the width of the image (middle third).  \n- **Snow-Covered Ground**: Uneven, with drifts, footprints, and clumps of snow.  \n\n#### **Background (Painted Backdrop)**\n- **Tree Trunk (Right Edge)**: Thick, vertical birch trunk (white bark with dark gray horizontal/vertical markings) running the full height of the image. It partially obscures the tiger’s body (only the tiger’s head, front legs, and torso are visible).  \n- **Bare Trees**: Rows of leafless deciduous trees receding into the distance. Trunks are thin, with sparse, gnarled branches.  \n- **Sky**: Pale blue with faint, wispy gray clouds.  \n\n#### **Other Elements**\n- **Snow Drifts**: Mounded snow around the deer’s hooves and tiger’s paws.  \n- **Footprints**:  \n  - Deer: Split hooves (2 marks per foot) in the snow.  \n  - Tiger: Round paw prints with visible claw marks.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is cool and muted, with warm accents from the tiger’s coat. Textures are highly realistic (critical for taxidermy dioramas).  \n\n| Element               | Colors                                                                 | Textures                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Deer**              | Tawny brown (body), lighter tan (underbelly), gray-brown (antlers).   | Short, smooth fur; antlers have rough, ridged texture. |\n| **Tiger**             | Bright orange (body), black (stripes), white (underbelly, cheeks, eyebrows). | Thick, plush fur (more textured on the mane/neck); stripes are matte. |\n| **Bird**              | Black (body/wings), white (wing patches, tail tip).                   | Feather texture—wings have layered, scaly feathers; body is soft. |\n| **Snow**              | Pure white (highlights), gray (shadows/drifts).                      | Smooth base with rough, uneven drifts; subtle grain to mimic packed snow. |\n| **Tree Trunk (Right)**| White (bark), dark gray (cracks/markings).                            | Rough, fissured bark with vertical cracks; snow clumps on the top edge. |\n| **Branches**          | Gray-brown (wood), white (snow).                                      | Thin, twisted branches with rough bark; snow is sparse and clumpy. |\n| **River**             | Blue-gray (frozen surface), darker gray (edges).                     | Smooth, reflective surface with a faint gradient (darker in the center). |\n| **Sky**               | Pale blue (base), faint gray (clouds).                                | Soft, hazy gradient (lighter at the horizon, darker at the top). |\n| **Background Trees**  | Gray-brown (trunks/branches), white (snow).                           | Bare, skeletal branches with minimal snow; trunks are thin and uniform. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **linear perspective** and **rule of thirds** to create depth. Objects are layered from foreground to background:  \n\n#### **Foreground (Closest to Viewer)**\n- **Deer**: Center-left, occupying the left 1/3 of the image. Body angled 45° to the left (leaping forward). Hooves are 1–2 inches above the snow (shadow beneath).  \n- **Tiger**: Center-right, partially hidden behind the tree trunk (only head, front legs, and torso visible). Head is turned toward the deer, creating a \"stalk-and-chase\" dynamic.  \n- **Tree Trunk**: Right edge, spanning the full height of the image. Width = ~1/8 of the image (thick enough to frame the tiger).  \n- **Branches**: Cross from the bottom left to the middle, overlapping the deer’s legs and the tiger’s paws. Add depth by breaking the foreground plane.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground**\n- **River**: Horizontal band across the center (y-axis: 40–50% from the bottom). Width = ~1/5 of the image. Snow banks frame both sides (thicker on the left).  \n- **Snow Drifts**: Clustered around the deer and tiger, emphasizing their weight and movement.  \n\n#### **Background (Painted Backdrop)**\n- **Trees**: Rows of bare trees receding into the horizon. Size decreases by 50% for each row (3–4 rows total).  \n- **Sky**: Occupies the top 1/3 of the image. Clouds are faint and spread evenly, with no sharp edges.  \n\n#### **Relative Sizes**\n- **Deer**: ~1.2x the length of the tiger (due to leaping posture and slightly closer placement).  \n- **Tiger**: Body length = ~2/3 of the deer’s body length (compact, muscular build).  \n- **Bird**: ~1/10 the size of the deer (small, distant).  \n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Key Light**: From the **left front**, casting shadows to the right of objects.  \n  - Deer: Shadow extends 6–8 inches to the right of its body.  \n  - Tiger: Shadow is blocked by the tree trunk (only visible under its front paws).  \n- **Highlights**: On the deer’s antlers, tiger’s stripes, and snow drifts (left side of each object).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The diorama mimics a natural scene with hyper-detailed taxidermy (fur texture, muscle definition) and a painted backdrop that uses linear perspective to create depth.  \n- **Diorama Aesthetics**: The foreground (taxidermied animals, tree trunk, branches) is 3D, while the background (river, trees, sky) is a 2D painted surface. This contrast is critical for SVG recreation—**foreground elements must have more texture and depth, while background elements are flatter**.  \n- **Composition**:  \n  - **Rule of Thirds**: The deer’s head is on the left third; the tiger’s head is on the right third; the bird is on the top-right third.  \n  - **Framing**: The tree trunk frames the right edge, while the foreground branches frame the bottom left.  \n  - **Dynamic Tension**: The deer’s leaping posture (leftward movement) contrasts with the tiger’s stalk (rightward focus), creating a sense of action.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Critical for SVG)**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these **geometric and textual details**:  \n\n#### **Deer**\n- **Antler Structure**: Left antler has a main beam with 5 tines (1 basal, 4 terminal); right antler has 6 tines (1 basal, 5 terminal).  \n- **Leg Position**: Front legs are raised to 45°; back legs are extended behind, with hooves angled downward.  \n- **Mouth**: Open, showing 4 incisors and 2 canines (white, slightly yellowed).  \n- **Eyes**: Large, brown, with black pupils (dilated, indicating fear).  \n\n#### **Tiger**\n- **Stripe Pattern**:  \n  - **Back**: 7 vertical stripes (evenly spaced, 1–2 inches wide).  \n  - **Sides**: 5 diagonal stripes (curving from the back to the belly).  \n  - **Legs**: 3 horizontal stripes per front leg; 4 per back leg (thinner than body stripes).  \n  - **Face**: 2 stripes from each eye to the mouth (curving downward); 1 central stripe between the eyes (straight).  \n- **Paw Details**: Front paws are round with 4 visible toes (claws extended); back paws are larger, with 5 toes (claws retracted).  \n- **Eyes**: Yellow with vertical black pupils (focused on the deer).  \n\n#### **Bird**\n- **Wing Shape**: Wings are spread to 120° (angle from body). Primary feathers are 8 per wing (fanned outward).  \n- **White Patches**: On the inner wings (2 inches wide) and tail tip (1 inch wide).  \n\n#### **Tree Trunk**\n- **Bark Markings**: Vertical dark gray cracks (1–2 inches wide) spaced 3–4 inches apart. Snow covers the top 1/4 of the trunk (clumpy, uneven).  \n\n#### **River**\n- **Gradient**: Darker blue-gray in the center (simulating depth) and lighter blue-gray on the edges (simulating ice).  \n- **Snow Banks**: Uneven edges with 1–2 inch tall drifts.  \n\n#### **Background Trees**\n- **Spacing**: Trees are 6–8 inches apart in the first row (closest to the river) and 12–14 inches apart in the second row.  \n- **Branch Density**: Each tree has 4–5 main branches (angled upward) with 2–3 sub-branches.  \n\n#### **Snow**\n- **Drifts**: Under the deer’s back legs (3 inches tall) and tiger’s front paws (2 inches tall).  \n- **Footprints**: Deer hooves are 1 inch wide (split into 2 halves); tiger paws are 2 inches wide (round, with 4 claw marks).  \n\n\n### **6. Layout and Proportions (SVG Grid Guidance)**\nFor a standard 1920x1080 SVG canvas:  \n- **Deer**: Positioned at (300, 400)–(800, 800) (left third). Body length = 500px; height = 300px (leaping).  \n- **Tiger**: Positioned at (1000, 350)–(1800, 750) (right third, behind the tree). Body length = 400px; height = 250px (stalking).  \n- **Tree Trunk**: Positioned at (1700, 0)–(1920, 1080) (right edge). Width = 220px; height = 1080px.  \n- **Bird**: Positioned at (1500, 0)–(1900, 200) (top right). Wingspan = 150px; body length = 50px.  \n- **River**: Positioned at (0, 450)–(1920, 550) (middle third). Height = 100px.  \n- **Sky**: Positioned at (0, 0)–(1920, 300) (top third).  \n\nUse **layered groups** for SVG:  \n- **Foreground**: Deer, tiger, tree trunk, branches (highest z-index).  \n- **Middle Ground**: River, snow drifts, footprints (medium z-index).  \n- **Background**: Trees, sky (lowest z-index).  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Artists**\n- **Prioritize Realism**: Use texture maps for fur (deer/tiger), bark (tree), and feathers (bird).  \n- **Depth Cues**: Foreground elements (deer, tiger, tree) should have **drop shadows** (10–20px blur) and **texture gradients** (lighter on top, darker on bottom). Background elements (river, trees) should be flatter with **subtle gradients** (no drop shadows).  \n- **Geometric Precision**: Antler tines, tiger stripes, and bird wing feathers must be counted and positioned exactly as described.  \n- **Lighting**: Apply **linear gradients** to snow (light left, dark right) and **radial gradients** to the tiger’s eyes (yellow center, black edge) to mimic the key light.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the diorama’s naturalistic charm and dynamic composition.",
  "v1_138": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and technical specifications required for precise replication. The image depicts a realistic, warmly lit pub interior with two central figures, traditional decor, and contextual details that define the setting.\n\n\n### **1.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **linear perspective** to create depth, with the foreground (tables/chairs) leading to the midground (figures) and background (windows/walls).  \n\n#### **Foreground**  \n- **Left**: A dark wooden chair with a curved backrest, partially draped in a dark cloth.  \n- **Right**: A rectangular wooden table with two cylindrical glasses: one half-filled with beer (foreground) and one empty (background, near the man).  \n\n#### **Midground**  \n- **Woman**: Centered in the image, standing with feet shoulder-width apart, arms relaxed at her sides. Her head is slightly tilted, and her gaze meets the viewer.  \n- **Man**: Positioned 1.5 meters to the woman’s right, leaning on a counter with his right hand. He is turned 45° toward the woman, with his left hand resting near his waist.  \n- **Counter (Right)**: Runs parallel to the right wall, at waist height (≈1 meter tall). The man stands between the counter and the back window.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Back Wall**: Dominated by two **rectangular windows** (each 2 meters tall × 1 meter wide) with diamond grilles (10 rows × 8 columns of diamonds per window). The windows are spaced 0.5 meters apart, with framed artwork between and around them:  \n  - **Left Window**: Flanked by two framed horse prints (0.5m × 0.7m each) with dark brown frames.  \n  - **Right Window**: Flanked by a framed document (0.4m × 0.6m) (indistinct text, possibly a license) and a framed crest (0.3m × 0.3m) (geometric design with a shield shape).  \n- **Booths**: Two curved-back leather booths (1.5m long × 0.8m tall) between the windows, attached to the back wall.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic scene** from a film/TV show, with a focus on:  \n- **Warm Lighting**: Diffused natural light from the windows creates a cozy, inviting atmosphere, contrasting with the darker interior (shadows on the left wall and booths).  \n- **Textural Contrast**: Rough plaster walls vs. smooth leather booths, polished wood vs. fuzzy knitwear, and transparent glass vs. matte fabric.  \n- **Depth**: Layering of foreground (tables/chairs), midground (figures), and background (windows/walls) using relative size and overlapping.  \n- **Contextual Realism**: Traditional pub elements (booths, beer glasses, horse decor) ground the scene in a familiar, lived-in space.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Symbols**  \n- **Union Jack**: Centered on the woman’s t-shirt (accurate proportions: red St. George’s cross over white St. Andrew’s cross over blue St. Patrick’s cross).  \n- **Horse Prints**: Two framed artworks on the left wall (depict horses with riders), suggesting a rural or equestrian theme.  \n- **Crest (Right Wall)**: A small framed shield with a geometric design (possibly a pub or family emblem).  \n\n#### **Text**  \n- **Framed Document (Right Wall)**: Indistinct text (likely a \"Licensed Premises\" sign or pub license), but too small to read clearly. No other visible text in the image.  \n\n#### **Specific Details**  \n- **Woman’s Necklaces**: Two layers: a short chain with a tiny pendant (heart or star) and a longer chain with a gold charm (possibly a letter or abstract shape).  \n- **Man’s Sweater**: Sleeves feature a **herringbone pattern** (alternating diagonal stripes) in light gray, contrasting with the solid gray body.  \n- **Beer Glass (Right Table)**: Has a 1cm foam head on top of dark beer, with subtle condensation on the glass.  \n- **Foreground Chair (Left)**: Draped in a dark cloth (jacket or towel), adding a lived-in feel.  \n- **Window Grilles**: Each diamond is a **rhombus** (10cm × 10cm) with a 2cm thick dark brown frame.  \n\n\n### **Technical Specifications for SVG Reproduction**\nTo ensure accuracy, include the following geometric and proportional details:  \n- **Windows**: Two rectangles (200cm × 100cm) with a diamond grid (10 rows × 8 columns per window). Each diamond is a rhombus with 60°/120° angles.  \n- **Framed Artwork**:  \n  - Horse prints (left wall): 50cm × 70cm, 30cm apart, centered vertically between the left window and corner.  \n  - Document (right wall): 40cm × 60cm, 20cm above the crest (30cm × 30cm).  \n- **Counter (Right)**: 200cm long × 100cm tall, with a 5cm thick edge. The man leans on it at the midpoint.  \n- **Glasses**:  \n  - Beer glass (right table): 15cm tall × 8cm diameter, with a 1cm foam layer.  \n  - Empty glass (foreground): 12cm tall × 6cm diameter, with a faint residue ring.  \n- **Woman’s T-Shirt**: Fitted to her torso, with the Union Jack centered (60cm wide × 40cm tall) at chest level.  \n- **Man’s Sweater**: Stripes are 2cm wide, alternating light/dark gray.

The focus on proportions, spatial relationships, and color accuracy ensures the final vector graphic will match the original scene closely.",
  "v1_139": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image (a scene from *American Beauty*, likely a funeral procession), the following detailed breakdown of **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** is essential. The description prioritizes geometric precision, proportionality, and visual consistency to guide vectorization.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **suburban street scene** with a curved sidewalk, parked cars, and two groups of people (a funeral procession) on the sidewalk. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground Group (Sidewalk)**\n- **3 Adults + 1 Child**:  \n  - **Left Woman**: Wears a long black coat, black hat, and holds a bouquet of pastel flowers (roses/lilies). Standing with feet shoulder-width apart.  \n  - **Middle Man**: Wears a long black coat, black fedora, and crosses his arms. Taller than the woman beside him.  \n  - **Right Woman**: Wears a dark blue skirt, black top, and holds a large green book (likely a Bible). Has a necklace and carries a small black bag.  \n  - **Child**: Standing in front of the adults, wears a dark coat and tie. Short blonde hair.  \n\n- **Foreground Man (Grass)**:  \n  - Balding man in a long gray trench coat, white shirt, and dark tie. Standing on the grass to the right of the sidewalk, facing the camera.  \n\n#### **Background Group (Sidewalk)**\n- **5 People (2 Children + 3 Adults)**:  \n  - **Left Child**: Wears a dark coat, hat, and holds a yellow bouquet. Walking beside a taller adult.  \n  - **Middle Child**: Wears a dark coat, hat, and holds a pink bouquet. Walking between two adults.  \n  - **Adults**: Three people in long black coats/dresses. One adult holds a small object (possibly a purse).  \n\n#### **Cars (Parked on Both Sides)**\n- **Left Side**:  \n  - **Silver Sedan**: Classic 1980s model with a boxy shape, white-wall tires, and a trunk lid with a chrome trim. Parked parallel to the street.  \n- **Right Side**:  \n  - **Gray Sedan**: Compact car with a rounded front, parked near the foreground.  \n  - **Silver Wagon**: Large, boxy wagon with a sloped rear window, parked in the foreground.  \n  - **Green SUV**: Dark green, boxy shape, parked further up the street.  \n  - **Black Car**: Sleek sedan, parked behind the SUV.  \n\n#### **Environment**\n- **Sidewalk**: Curved, light-gray concrete path running from the foreground to the background, widening slightly as it curves.  \n- **Lawns**: Well-maintained grass on both sides of the sidewalk/street.  \n- **Street**: Asphalt road with a gentle curve, lined with parked cars.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are **warm and muted**, with golden-hour sunlight casting long shadows and highlighting grass/cars. Textures are realistic but simplified for SVG (e.g., grass as stippled, cars as smooth).\n\n| Element | Color (Hex) | Texture | Notes |\n|---------|-------------|---------|-------|\n| **Grass** | Sunlit: `#3CB371` (Medium Sea Green)<br>Shaded: `#2E8B57` (Dark Sea Green) | Stippled (small dots) | Mown grass with long shadows from unseen trees. |\n| **Sidewalk** | `#D3D3D3` (Light Gray) | Smooth | Slight texture to indicate concrete. |\n| **Street** | `#404040` (Dark Gray) | Smooth | Asphalt with faint tire marks. |\n| **Cars** | Silver Sedan: `#C0C0C0` (Silver)<br>Gray Sedan: `#808080` (Gray)<br>Silver Wagon: `#C0C0C0` (Silver)<br>Green SUV: `#2F4F4F` (Dark Slate Gray)<br>Black Car: `#000000` (Black) | Reflective (add subtle highlights on hoods/trunks) | Chrome trim on car bumpers/grilles (small `#FFFFFF` accents). |\n| **People’s Clothing** | Adults: `#000000` (Black)<br>Right Woman’s Skirt: `#00008B` (Dark Blue)<br>Foreground Man’s Coat: `#808080` (Gray) | Matte (wool) | The right woman’s skirt has a slight sheen; coats are thick (wool texture). |\n| **Flowers** | Bouquets: `#FFC0CB` (Pink), `#FFFFE0` (Pale Yellow), `#FFFFFF` (White)<br>Stems: `#2E8B57` (Dark Sea Green) | Soft (petals) | Pastel colors; bouquet held by the left woman has ~10 flowers. |\n| **Book (Right Woman)** | `#2E8B57` (Dark Sea Green) | Matte | Rectangular shape with a thick spine. |\n| **Shadows** | `#1A1A1A` (Dark Gray) | Transparent (50% opacity) | Irregular shapes following the contours of grass, cars, and people. Longer shadows on the left (sun from the right). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses **linear perspective** to guide the eye along the curved sidewalk from the foreground to the background. Key spatial rules:\n\n#### **Sidewalk**\n- **Path**: Curves from the bottom-center (foreground) to the top-left (background).  \n- **Width**: Consistent (~1.5 meters, or 1/10 of the image width).  \n- **Position**: Separates the left lawn (with one parked car) from the right lawn (with multiple parked cars).  \n\n#### **Foreground Group (Sidewalk)**\n- **3 Adults**: Standing in a tight cluster at the **bottom-center** of the sidewalk. The left woman (flowers) is closest to the left lawn; the middle man (fedora) is centered; the right woman (book) is closest to the right lawn.  \n- **Child**: Standing 1 meter in front of the adults, slightly to the right.  \n\n#### **Foreground Man (Grass)**\n- Positioned **1 meter to the right of the sidewalk** (foreground), between the sidewalk and the right lawn. Fills the lower-right third of the image.  \n\n#### **Background Group (Sidewalk)**\n- **5 People**: Walking in a loose line 5–7 meters behind the foreground group. The two children (with bouquets) are in the center, flanked by three adults.  \n\n#### **Cars**\n- **Left Side**: One silver sedan parked parallel to the street, 2 meters from the start of the sidewalk (foreground).  \n- **Right Side**: Four cars parked in a line parallel to the street:  \n  - **Silver Wagon** (foreground): Closest to the camera,占据 the right edge of the image.  \n  - **Gray Sedan**: Parked behind the wagon, halfway up the street.  \n  - **Green SUV**: Parked further back, near the background group.  \n  - **Black Car**: Parked behind the SUV, at the top-right of the image.  \n\n#### **Street**\n- **Curve**: Bends left in the background, with more parked cars visible in the distance (top-center).  \n\n#### **Lawns**\n- **Left Lawn**: Larger than the right lawn, with a small flower bed (yellow flowers) near the silver sedan.  \n- **Right Lawn**: Narrower, with grass extending to the edge of the parked cars.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The scene is a realistic movie still, so SVG must replicate lifelike proportions, lighting, and textures.  \n- **Depth of Field**: Everything is in focus (shallow depth of field is not used), so all elements (foreground man, background cars) must be detailed.  \n- **Lighting**: **Golden hour** (late afternoon) with warm sunlight:  \n  - **Highlights**: On the right side of cars, the top of the grass, and the faces of people.  \n  - **Shadows**: Long, dark shadows on the left side of objects (sun from the right).  \n- **Composition**: Uses the **rule of thirds**—the foreground man is at the intersection of the lower-right third; the sidewalk curves along the center third.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text**: No visible text (car license plates are too small to read).  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - **Bouquets**: Indicate a funeral (pastel colors are typical for condolences).  \n  - **Book (Bible)**: Held by the right woman, reinforces the funeral context.  \n  - **Black Clothing**: Worn by all adults, a universal symbol of mourning.  \n- **Specific Details**:  \n  - **Left Woman (Flowers)**: Has long dark hair, wears a black hat with a wide brim.  \n  - **Middle Man (Fedora)**: Wears a black tie and polished black shoes.  \n  - **Right Woman (Book)**: Has short dark hair, wears a necklace with a small pendant.  \n  - **Foreground Man (Trench Coat)**: Balding with a receding hairline, wears a gray coat that falls to his knees.  \n  - **Background Children**: Wear school uniforms (dark coats, hats) and hold small bouquets (yellow/pink).  \n  - **Cars**:  \n    - **Silver Sedan (Left)**: Classic 1980s model with a trunk lid that extends beyond the body. White-wall tires.  \n    - **Silver Wagon (Right)**: Has a sloped rear window and a roof rack (not visible in the image, but implied by the shape).  \n    - **Green SUV (Background)**: Boxy shape with a large rear window.  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric Details for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, use **basic geometric shapes** (rectangles, circles, polygons) and **paths** for curves. Key measurements (based on a 1920x1080 image):\n\n#### **Sidewalk**\n- **Shape**: Curved rectangle (path with two straight sides and a curved top).  \n- **Dimensions**: 1.5 meters wide (1/10 of the image width) × 10 meters long (from foreground to background).  \n- **Corners**: Rounded (5% radius) to mimic a concrete sidewalk.  \n\n#### **Cars**\n- **Silver Sedan (Left)**:  \n  - **Shape**: Rectangle with rounded edges (hood/trunk).  \n  - **Dimensions**: 4.5 meters long × 1.8 meters wide.  \n  - **Wheels**: Four circles (0.6 meters diameter) with white walls (0.1 meters wide).  \n- **Silver Wagon (Right)**:  \n  - **Shape**: Rectangle with a sloped rear (path).  \n  - **Dimensions**: 5 meters long × 1.9 meters wide.  \n- **Gray Sedan (Right)**:  \n  - **Shape**: Rectangle with a rounded front.  \n  - **Dimensions**: 4.2 meters long × 1.7 meters wide.  \n\n#### **People**\n- **Adults**:  \n  - **Height**: 1.7–1.8 meters (0.25 of the image height).  \n  - **Shape**: Human figures drawn with basic paths (torso = rectangle, head = circle, limbs = lines).  \n  - **Postures**:  \n    - **Left Woman (Flowers)**: Arms slightly bent, bouquet held at waist height.  \n    - **Middle Man (Fedora)**: Arms crossed over his chest.  \n    - **Right Woman (Book)**: Arms extended forward, book held at chest height.  \n- **Children**:  \n  - **Height**: 1.2–1.3 meters (0.15 of the image height).  \n  - **Postures**: Walking with legs slightly bent, bouquets held at hip height.  \n\n#### **Flowers**\n- **Bouquet (Left Woman)**:  \n  - **Shape**: Cluster of 10–12 circles (petals) on a straight line (stem).  \n  - **Dimensions**: Petals = 0.1 meters diameter; stem = 0.5 meters long.  \n- **Bouquets (Children)**: Smaller clusters (5–7 petals) on shorter stems (0.3 meters).  \n\n#### **Book (Right Woman)**\n- **Shape**: Rectangle with rounded corners.  \n- **Dimensions**: 0.3 meters wide × 0.4 meters tall × 0.1 meters thick.  \n\n\n### **7. Layout and Proportions**\nThe image follows **golden ratio** proportions to create balance:  \n- **Foreground**: Takes up 40% of the image (lower third).  \n- **Midground**: Takes up 30% (center third).  \n- **Background**: Takes up 30% (upper third).  \n\nKey proportional rules:  \n- **Cars**: Width = 2× height (standard sedan ratio).  \n- **People**: Height = 7× head size (realistic human proportion).  \n- **Sidewalk**: Width = 1/2 the height of an adult (realistic for a suburban sidewalk).  \n\n\n### **8. Final Notes for SVG**\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into layers (e.g., `Background` [street, distant cars], `Midground` [sidewalk, background group], `Foreground` [foreground group, foreground man, nearby cars]).  \n- **Opacity**: Use 50% opacity for shadows to mimic transparency.  \n- **Highlights**: Add small white circles (10% opacity) to car hoods and flower petals to simulate reflection.  \n- **Textures**: Use **pattern fills** for grass (small black dots on green) and **gradient fills** for cars (light gray to dark gray) to add depth.  \n\nBy following this detailed breakdown, the SVG will accurately replicate the composition, lighting, and mood of the original image.",

  "v1_141": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, we’ll break down the composition into **main objects**, **colors/textures**, **spatial relationships**, **style**, and **key details**—with a focus on geometric precision, proportionality, and layout. The scene depicts two figures in a luxurious, ornate room, with a warm, intimate atmosphere.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is centered on **two human figures** and a **decorative background** with historical/baroque influences. Below is a breakdown of each component:\n\n#### **Foreground Figures**\n##### **Woman (Left, Back View)**\n- **Hair**: The most prominent feature—long (waist-length), loose curls with tight-to-medium spiral patterns. Curls vary in size (1–3 inches diameter) and direction (some falling forward over shoulders, others cascading straight down). Strands are voluminous, with subtle flyaways framing the nape.\n- **Garment**: A light-colored, loose-fitting top/dress with a high neck (visible at the nape) and short sleeves (or sleeveless—shoulders are bare). The fabric hangs softly, with minimal structure.\n- **Silhouette**: Curved, organic shape dominated by hair. Her head is turned slightly toward the man, creating a diagonal line from her shoulders to the top of her head.\n\n##### **Man (Right, Front View)**\n- **Hair**: Short (2–3 inches), sleek, and combed straight back with no part. The shape is a smooth, rounded dome with a slight peak at the crown.\n- **Attire**: \n  - **Tuxedo Jacket**: Black, single-breasted with **peak lapels** (triangular, upward-pointing edges). The collar sits above a white dress shirt.\n  - **Shirt**: White, high-collared (**wing collar**—points stand upright) with two visible buttons: one at the collar (securing the wing points) and one at the chest (below the bow tie).\n  - **Bow Tie**: White, self-tied (asymmetrical loops, small knot in the center) sitting at the collar.\n- **Silhouette**: Structured, angular shape with broad shoulders and a tailored waist. His head is tilted slightly downward, with eyes focused on the woman.\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n##### **Walls & Paneling**\n- **Left Wall**: Dark wood paneling (vertical planks) with **ornate gold carvings** (floral motifs, scrolls, and geometric borders). Carvings are raised, with repeating patterns spanning the height of the wall.\n- **Right Wall**: A large, rectangular mirror with a **gilded frame** (matching the wall carvings). The frame is thick (3–4 inches) with a stepped design (inner border of small gold leaves, outer border of larger floral motifs). The mirror reflects a partial view of the room (curtains, a window, and faint furniture).\n\n##### **Curtains**\n- Hanging between the left paneling and the mirror (center background). Floor-length, heavy fabric with a **muted gold/beige base** and subtle **small floral patterns** (1–2 inches diameter). The curtains are gathered at the top, with loose folds cascading to the floor.\n\n##### **Ceiling**\n- **Coffered design**: White rectangular panels separated by dark brown molding. The molding runs horizontally along the top edge of the image, framing the scene.\n\n##### **Lamp**\n- A tall, thin floor lamp behind the curtains (center background). The pole is silver (vertical line) with a small, rounded shade (not fully visible) at the top.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **warm and luxurious**, dominated by reds, golds, and browns, with high contrast between the foreground figures and background.\n\n#### **Colors**\n| Element                | Hex Code       | Description                                  |\n|------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Woman’s Hair (Base)    | `#C75A3A`      | Warm auburn (red-brown)                      |\n| Woman’s Hair (Highlights) | `#E07A5A`    | Golden-red (catches light)                   |\n| Woman’s Garment        | `#F5F0EB`      | Pale cream (soft, matte)                     |\n| Man’s Jacket           | `#000000`      | Jet black (satin sheen on lapels)            |\n| Man’s Shirt/Bow Tie    | `#FFFFFF`      | Bright white (matte shirt, slightly shiny bow tie) |\n| Wall Paneling          | `#3B241D`      | Dark walnut (rich, wood grain texture)       |\n| Paneling Carvings/Mirror Frame | `#D4AF37` | Brushed gold (metallic sheen)                |\n| Mirror Frame (Shadows) | `#9B7600`      | Dark gold (depth for raised motifs)          |\n| Curtains (Base)        | `#A68F6C`      | Muted beige (heavy, textured fabric)         |\n| Curtains (Pattern)     | `#D4AF37`      | Gold floral/geometric motifs                 |\n| Ceiling Panels         | `#E0D6D1`      | Pale cream (matte)                           |\n| Ceiling Molding        | `#3B241D`      | Dark walnut (matches paneling)               |\n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Woman’s Hair**: Organic, textured curls—use **multiple overlapping curved paths** with varying opacities to simulate volume and movement.\n- **Man’s Hair**: Smooth, glossy—use a **gradient fill** (lighter at the crown, darker at the temples) to mimic shine.\n- **Tuxedo Jacket**: Satin lapels—add a **linear gradient** (white to black) along the lapel edges to create a reflective sheen.\n- **Wall Paneling**: Carved wood—use a **pattern fill** (repeating floral/scroll SVG paths) on a dark brown base, with subtle **drop shadows** to emphasize depth.\n- **Mirror Frame**: Gilded metal—apply a **radial gradient** (light gold at the center, dark gold at the edges) to the frame, with **raised paths** for motifs (to simulate embossing).\n- **Curtains**: Heavy brocade—use a **pattern fill** (small floral/geometric shapes) on a beige base, with **vertical gradient** (lighter at the top, darker at the bottom) to show folds.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition follows the **rule of thirds**, with the woman on the **left third** and the man on the **right third** of the image. The background fills the middle third, creating balance.\n\n#### **Figure Placement**\n- **Woman**: Occupies the left 30% of the image. Her head is at the same vertical height as the man’s head (eye level), but her body is slightly turned toward him, creating a diagonal line from her shoulders to his chest.\n- **Man**: Occupies the right 35% of the image. He stands upright, facing slightly left (toward the woman). His shoulders are aligned with the right edge of the mirror.\n- **Distance**: The figures are 1–2 feet apart, with the woman’s hair nearly touching the man’s jacket (intimate proximity).\n\n#### **Background Layout**\n- **Left Wall Paneling**: Extends from the left edge of the image to the center (50% width). The carvings are evenly spaced, with a horizontal border at the top (matching the ceiling molding).\n- **Mirror**: Located on the right wall, spanning 30% of the image width (from center-right to right edge). The frame is centered vertically, with the top edge aligned with the ceiling molding.\n- **Curtains**: Hang between the left paneling and the mirror (center 20% width). They extend from the ceiling to the floor, with folds concentrated at the bottom.\n- **Ceiling Molding**: Runs horizontally along the top edge of the image (100% width), with a 2-inch height. The coffered panels are 12–18 inches square, separated by 1-inch molding.\n\n#### **Proportions**\n- **Human Scale**: Assume the man is 6 feet tall (standard). The woman is slightly shorter (5’8”–5’10”), but her hair adds visual height.\n  - **Man’s Jacket**: 36 inches long (from collar to waist).\n  - **Woman’s Hair**: 30 inches long (from crown to waist).\n- **Mirror**: 6 feet tall (floor to ceiling) × 4 feet wide (matches the man’s height).\n- **Wall Paneling**: 8 feet tall (floor to ceiling), with 1-foot molding at the top (coffered ceiling).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **realistic, cinematic style** (consistent with mid-20th-century film, e.g., *The Godfather* franchise). Key artistic choices include:\n\n#### **Depth of Field**\n- **Deep focus**: Both foreground (woman’s hair) and background (mirror, paneling) are in sharp focus, emphasizing the room’s grandeur and the figures’ interaction.\n- **Lighting**: Warm, soft key light from the left (behind the woman) and fill light from the mirror (right) creates even illumination. Gold accents (panelings, mirror frame) catch the light, adding drama.\n\n#### **Color Palette**\n- **Warm tones**: Reds (woman’s hair), golds (panelings), and browns (walls) create an intimate, formal atmosphere. The man’s black tuxedo and the woman’s light garment provide high contrast, drawing attention to their faces.\n\n#### **Composition**\n- **Balance**: The woman’s organic, curly shape (left) contrasts with the man’s structured, angular shape (right). The mirror and paneling frame the figures, guiding the viewer’s eye to their interaction.\n- **Verticality**: Tall elements (curtains, mirror, paneling) create a sense of height, emphasizing the room’s luxury.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No visible text** in the image.\n- **Symbols**: The **ornate floral/scroll motifs** on the walls and mirror frame are classic baroque/rococo designs, indicating a historical (1920s–1940s) or period-specific setting (e.g., a mansion or hotel ballroom).\n- **Key Details for SVG**:\n  - **Woman’s Hair**: Use **15–20 individual curl paths** (varying in size and direction) with **subtle stroke weights** (0.5–1px) to simulate texture. Add 3–5 flyaway strands (thin, curved paths) around her shoulders.\n  - **Man’s Bow Tie**: Create a **symmetrical bow shape** with two loops (1.5 inches wide each) and a small knot (0.5 inches tall) in the center. Add a **slight gradient** (white to off-white) to the loops for depth.\n  - **Mirror Reflection**: The reflection is a **blurred, desaturated copy** of the left wall (panelings, curtains) with a **slight blue tint** (to mimic glass). Use a **mask** to crop the reflection to the mirror’s bounds.\n  - **Wall Carvings**: Create a **repeating pattern** (12x12 inches) of floral/scroll motifs. Apply the pattern to the left wall paneling and mirror frame using SVG’s `<pattern>` element.\n  - **Tuxedo Lapels**: The peak lapels are **two triangular paths** (3 inches tall, 2 inches wide at the base) extending from the collar. Add a **linear gradient** (black to dark gray) to the lapels for a satin sheen.\n\n\n### **SVG Technical Notes for Reproduction**\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into layers (e.g., `background`, `woman`, `man`, `mirror`, `curtains`) for ease of editing.\n- **Paths**: Use **closed paths** for all solid elements (hair, jacket, paneling) and **open paths** for lines (flyaways, lamp pole).\n- **Gradients**: Use **linear gradients** for satin textures (tuxedo lapels) and **radial gradients** for metallic surfaces (mirror frame).\n- **Patterns**: Define reusable patterns for wall carvings and curtain motifs (e.g., `<pattern id=\"floral-motif\" width=\"12\" height=\"12\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">`).\n- **Opacity**: Use **low opacity** (10–20%) for the mirror reflection to distinguish it from the real background.\n\n\n### **Summary of Critical SVG Requirements**\nTo ensure accuracy, the SVG must prioritize:\n- **Geometric precision** for the man’s tuxedo (lapels, bow tie) and the woman’s hair (curls, flyaways).\n- **Pattern consistency** for the wall carvings and mirror frame (repeating floral/scroll motifs).\n- **Color accuracy** (warm reds, golds, browns) and **texture simulation** (satin, wood, brocade) via gradients and patterns.\n- **Spatial proportionality** (figure heights, mirror size, wall paneling) to maintain the room’s luxury and the figures’ intimacy.\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will faithfully reproduce the image’s mood, style, and composition.",

Stem: Short (1/4 the height of the pumpkin), cut at the top (flat end), green with a dark green base.  \n- **Center Foreground Pumpkin**: Positioned directly in front of the girl’s back, slightly left of the center. Shape: Round with 8 ribs, slightly smaller than the right foreground pumpkin. Stem: Long (1/2 the height of the pumpkin), curved slightly to the right, green with a light green tip.  \n- **Right Middle Ground Pumpkin**: Adjacent to the right foreground pumpkin (left of it), partially overlapping. Shape: Round with 9 ribs, deeper red hue. Stem: Thick (1/3 the height of the pumpkin), straight, green with a dark green base.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground Pumpkins**\n- **Left Middle Ground Pumpkin**: Behind the center foreground pumpkin, next to the boy’s shoulder. Shape: Round with 7 ribs, pale pinkish-orange. Stem: Short (1/5 the height of the pumpkin), green.  \n- **Background Pumpkins**: 2–3 smaller, less detailed pumpkins behind the main ones (e.g., a partially visible orange pumpkin above the left middle ground pumpkin).  \n\n#### **People (Crouching Behind Pumpkins)**\n- **Girl (Front)**: Positioned on the left side, facing away from the camera. Shape: Crouching with knees bent (legs at 90°), upper body leaning forward. Hair: Curly, shoulder-length, brown. Clothing: Light pink hoodie (loose fit), dark blue jeans. Hands: Left hand near her mouth (fist), right hand resting on her knee (palm down).  \n- **Boy (Behind Girl)**: Partially obscured by the girl and pumpkins. Shape: Leaning in toward the girl, upper body visible. Hair: Short, straight, brown. Clothing: Black jacket with two white horizontal stripes on the sleeves (from shoulder to wrist), gray inner lining.  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Wooded Area**: Dark, out-of-focus trees and foliage occupying the left 1/3 of the image (behind the people). Shape: Irregular, dense clusters of leaves and branches.  \n- **Ground**: Visible at the bottom left, between the girl’s legs and the trees. Shape: Sloped, covered in short green grass and brown dirt.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified using approximate hex codes for SVG accuracy. Textures are described to guide pattern/gradient application.\n\n#### **Pumpkins**\n- **Right Foreground (Largest)**: Base color = `#FFA500` (orange). Ribs = `#CC6600` (dark orange). Stem = `#6B8E23` (olive green) with `#2E8B57` (sea green) base. **Water droplets**: Small (`1–2px`), round, `#FFFFFF` (white) with `#ADD8E6` (light blue) highlights (placed randomly on the upper half).  \n- **Center Foreground**: Base color = `#D2B48C` (tan). Ribs = `#8B4513` (saddle brown). Stem = `#9ACD32` (yellow green) with `#6B8E23` (olive green) tip.  \n- **Right Middle Ground**: Base color = `#FF4500` (orangered). Ribs = `#8B0000` (dark red). Stem = `#2E8B57` (sea green) with `#006400` (dark green) base.  \n- **Left Middle Ground**: Base color = `#FFC0CB` (pale pink). Ribs = `#FF69B4` (hot pink). Stem = `#90EE90` (light green).  \n\n**Texture Common to All Pumpkins**: Slightly rough/matte surface with subtle imperfections (e.g., `1px` brown specks `#A52A2A` on the center foreground pumpkin, faint scratch marks on the right foreground pumpkin).\n\n#### **People**\n- **Girl**: Hoodie = `#FFE4E1` (misty rose) with a fuzzy texture (add `1px` `#FFFFFF` highlights on the shoulders). Jeans = `#00008B` (dark blue) with `#808080` (gray) stitching lines (along seams). Hair = `#8B4513` (saddle brown) with `#A0522D` (sienna) highlights (curly lines).  \n- **Boy**: Jacket = `#000000` (black) with `#FFFFFF` (white) stripes (`5px` wide, parallel to sleeve edges). Inner lining = `#808080` (gray). Hair = `#654321` (brown) with `#8B4513` (saddle brown) highlights (straight lines).  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Trees/Foliage**: `#006400` (dark green) with `#228B22` (forest green) highlights (blurred using a Gaussian blur effect for depth).  \n- **Ground**: Grass = `#32CD32` (lime green) with `#2E8B57` (sea green) shadows. Dirt = `#A52A2A` (brown) with `#8B4513` (saddle brown) texture (small `1px` specks).  \n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Key Light**: Comes from the **left-front**, casting soft shadows to the right of objects. Pumpkins on the right are brightest; people and background are in partial shadow.  \n- **Shadows**: Added to the left side of each pumpkin (using `#000000` with `20%` opacity) and under the people’s bodies (soft, irregular shapes).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses a **diagonal composition** (pumpkins stack from bottom-right to top-left) with a deep depth of field (foreground in focus, background blurred). Below are precise layer order and alignment details:\n\n#### **Layer Order (Front to Back)**\n1. Right Foreground Pumpkin (largest)  \n2. Right Middle Ground Pumpkin  \n3. Center Foreground Pumpkin  \n4. Girl (upper body/head)  \n5. Boy (upper body/head)  \n6. Left Middle Ground Pumpkin  \n7. Background Pumpkins  \n8. Trees/Foliage  \n9. Ground  \n\n#### **Alignment**\n- **Right Foreground Pumpkin**: Right edge aligned with the image’s right edge; bottom edge aligned with the image’s bottom edge.  \n- **Center Foreground Pumpkin**: Left edge overlaps the girl’s right arm (by `1/3` of the pumpkin’s width); top edge reaches the girl’s shoulder.  \n- **Girl**: Left edge aligned with the image’s left 1/4; bottom edge aligned with the image’s bottom 1/4 (knees at the bottom).  \n- **Boy**: Right edge overlaps the center foreground pumpkin’s left stem; top edge reaches the girl’s ear.  \n- **Trees**: Left edge aligned with the image’s left edge; right edge overlaps the girl’s back (by `1/2` of the trees’ width).  \n\n#### **Proportions**\n- **Pumpkin Sizes**: Right foreground pumpkin = `600px` wide × `700px` tall (assuming a `1200px` × `800px` image). Center foreground pumpkin = `500px` wide × `600px` tall. Right middle ground pumpkin = `400px` wide × `500px` tall.  \n- **People Sizes**: Girl’s height (knees to head) = `500px` (matches the center foreground pumpkin’s height). Boy’s height = `400px` (partially hidden).  \n- **Stem Sizes**: Proportional to pumpkin size (e.g., center foreground pumpkin’s stem = `300px` tall; right foreground pumpkin’s stem = `150px` tall).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The image is a cinematic still with realistic proportions, textures, and lighting. SVG should prioritize accurate shape reproduction while simplifying extreme detail (e.g., water droplets as simple circles, hair as stylized curves).  \n- **Depth of Field**: Foreground pumpkins are in sharp focus; background trees are blurred (use a Gaussian blur filter with `5px` radius for the trees layer).  \n- **Mood**: Intimate and slightly mysterious (people hiding behind pumpkins, dark background). Lighting emphasizes the pumpkins as the focal point.  \n- **Camera Angle**: Low-angle shot (looking up at the pumpkins), making them appear larger than life.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No text or symbols** are present.  \n- **Unique Details**:  \n  - The girl’s left hand is curled into a fist near her mouth (suggesting she’s whispering or holding a small object).  \n  - The boy’s jacket has **two white stripes** on each sleeve (not one)—parallel, `5px` wide, spaced `10px` apart.  \n  - The right foreground pumpkin’s stem is **cut** (flat top), while others have pointed tips.  \n  - The ground has a **slope** (rising from left to right), with grass on the left and dirt on the right (under the girl’s knees).  \n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these technical tips:  \n- **Layers**: Use separate layers for each pumpkin, person, and background element (e.g., `#largest-pumpkin`, `#girl`, `#trees`).  \n- **Paths**: Draw pumpkins using `ellipse` or `path` elements with vertical ribbing (use `stroke` for ribs, `fill` for base color).  \n- **Textures**: Apply water droplets as `circle` elements with `filter: drop-shadow(1px 1px 1px #000000)` for depth.  \n- **Blur**: Use `filter: blur(5px)` on the trees layer to simulate depth of field.  \n- **Shadows**: Add `filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 3px #000000)` to pumpkins and people for 3D effect.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, color, and mood.",
  "v1_143": "To accurately recreate this bakery scene as an SVG, the following detailed breakdown of **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and precise details** is provided. The description prioritizes geometric clarity, texture cues, and proportional accuracy for vector reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe scene is a realistic, brightly lit bakery with three key foreground figures and multiple display structures. Below are the primary elements, organized by their role in the composition:\n\n#### **A. Display Cases (Core Structural Elements)**\n- **Main Bakery Display Case (Left Foreground-Midground)**:  \n  A tall, rectangular structure (~6.5 ft tall, 4 ft wide) with a **white metal base** and a curved glass front (top half) for visibility. It has **5 evenly spaced shelves** (12–18 in apart) holding organized pastries. The top edge of the case features a **wooden trim** (brown) for aesthetic appeal.  \n  - **Shelf 1 (Top, Above Glass)**: 3 stacks of round, flat cookies (6–8 per stack).  \n  - **Shelf 2 (First Glass Shelf)**: Pastries rolled in nuts (e.g., cinnamon rolls or rugelach) arranged in a single row.  \n  - **Shelf 3**: Chocolate-dipped pastries (e.g., éclairs or cream puffs) in a dense row.  \n  - **Shelf 4**: Cream-topped pastries (e.g., strawberry shortcake or cream tarts) with visible swirls of icing.  \n  - **Shelf 5 (Bottom)**: Flaky pastries (croissants, danishes) and a few spiral-shaped items (e.g., pain au chocolat).  \n\n- **Secondary Display Case (Center-Right)**: A shorter rectangular case (~4 ft tall) with a glass front and white base. It holds a small number of pastries (e.g., muffins or small cakes) and is positioned behind the two right-hand figures.  \n\n- **Frozen Food Case (Right Background)**: A tall, rectangular cooler (~5 ft tall) with glass doors and a **blue top sign** (\"Frozen Foods\" in white text). Below the sign, a **white rectangular sign** (illegible black/red text) is taped to the glass. The case contains indistinct frozen items (e.g., pre-made dough or desserts).  \n\n#### **B. Human Figures (Foreground-Midground)**\nThree people dominate the composition, with varying proximity to the camera:  \n- **Woman in Gray Dress (Left Foreground)**:  \n  Closest to the camera (~1.5 ft from lens), standing facing the main display case. She wears a **sleeveless gray cotton dress** (knee-length) and carries a **black leather crossbody bag** (shiny, with a silver buckle) on her left shoulder. Her right hand holds a small object (phone or wallet).  \n- **Man in Dark Shirt/Shorts (Center-Right)**:  \n  Standing in the midground (~3 ft from camera), leaning against the secondary display case. He wears a **dark gray cotton t-shirt**, **khaki cargo shorts** (with multiple pockets), and blue sneakers. His right hand holds a pastry (e.g., a turnover or empanada), and his left hand rests on his hip.  \n- **Woman in Red Jacket (Right)**:  \n  Standing next to the man (~3 ft from camera), facing him. She wears a **red polyester jacket** (open, over a white tank top), **distressed denim shorts** (knee-length), and **tan leather sandals**. A **purple fabric crossbody bag** hangs from her right shoulder. She holds a folded menu/list in both hands and has a black bracelet on her left wrist.  \n\n#### **C. Background Elements**\n- **Wall Shelving (Above Main Display Case)**: Metal shelves holding additional baked goods (e.g., loaves of bread, rolls) and a few decorative items (e.g., a white cloth with a pattern).  \n- **Clock (Back Wall)**: A round, white-faced clock (~1 ft diameter) with black numerals (1–12) and hands (showing ~10:10, a common \"neutral\" time in media). It is mounted above the secondary display case.  \n- **Fluorescent Lights (Ceiling)**: A single long, rectangular light fixture (~3 ft long) above the main display case, casting cool white light.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is warm and inviting, with contrast between the bright display case lighting and neutral background tones. Textures are critical for realism in the SVG:  \n\n| Element | Colors | Textures |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Main Display Case** | White base, clear glass, brown wooden trim | Glass: Semi-transparent (subtle reflections); Wood: Matte, grainy; Metal base: Slightly textured. |\n| **Pastries** | Golden brown (croissants), tan (nuts), dark brown (chocolate), white (cream), pale yellow (dough) | Varied: Crumbly (croissants), glossy (icing), rough (nut toppings), smooth (chocolate dip). |\n| **Human Figures** | Gray dress, black bag, dark gray shirt, khaki shorts, red jacket, white tank top, denim shorts, tan sandals | Fabric: Matte (cotton, polyester); Leather: Shiny (bag, sandals); Denim: Distressed (shorts). |\n| **Walls/Floor** | Light gray (walls), gray speckled linoleum (floor) | Walls: Flat, matte; Floor: Slightly textured (speckles). |\n| **Signs/Clock** | Blue (\"Frozen Foods\"), white (clock face), black (clock hands/numerals) | Signs: Flat, solid; Clock: Smooth, with subtle depth (bezel). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is balanced, with the main display case anchoring the left third of the image and the figures occupying the right two-thirds. Key proportional and positional details:  \n\n- **Main Display Case**: Extends from the left edge of the frame to the center, occupying ~30% of the width. It is the tallest object in the scene (~6.5 ft), towering over the figures (average height: ~5.5–6 ft).  \n- **Figures**:  \n  - The woman in gray is **closest to the camera** (foreground), standing in front of the main display case. Her body is turned slightly toward the case, with her back to the lens.  \n  - The man and woman in red are **in the midground**, positioned to the right of the main display case. They stand side-by-side, with the man leaning against the secondary display case and the woman facing him.  \n- **Frozen Food Case**: Against the back right wall, behind the man and woman. It is shorter than the main display case (~5 ft tall) and occupies ~15% of the image width.  \n- **Clock**: Centered horizontally on the back wall, above the secondary display case. It is positioned at eye level for the figures (~5 ft from the floor).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe original image is a **realistic movie still**, but for SVG reproduction, the style should balance:  \n- **Clean Vector Lines**: For structural elements (display cases, walls, figures) to ensure scalability.  \n- **Gradient Lighting**: Warm yellow gradients inside the main display case to mimic the soft, diffused glow of internal bakery lights. Cool white gradients for the ceiling fluorescent light.  \n- **Texture Patterns**: Subtle patterns for pastries (e.g., nut clusters, chocolate drizzle) and fabrics (e.g., denim stitching, leather grain) to add depth without overwhelming the vector format.  \n- **Semi-Transparency**: For glass surfaces (display cases, frozen food case) to show subtle reflections (e.g., the ceiling light in the main case’s glass).  \n\nThe overall mood is casual and inviting, with the bright display case drawing the viewer’s eye to the baked goods.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Signs**:  \n  - **Main Display Case**: A small white rectangular sign (~4x2 in) with black text (illegible, likely \"Fresh Baked\" or \"Today’s Selection\") mounted on the right edge of the case.  \n  - **Frozen Food Case**:  \n    - Top: Blue rectangular sign (~18x6 in) with white capital text: \"FROZEN FOODS\".  \n    - Bottom: White rectangular sign (~12x8 in) with black/red text (illegible, e.g., \"Special Offer\" or \"Today’s Deal\").  \n- **Clock**: Perfect circle with a white face, black numerals (1–12) spaced evenly, and black hands (hour hand shorter than minute hand).  \n- **Pastry Details**:  \n  - Main display case shelf 3: Chocolate-dipped pastries have a thin, uneven drizzle of dark brown icing.  \n  - Main display case shelf 4: Cream-topped pastries have a swirl pattern (use a \"spiral\" vector shape for the icing).  \n- **Human Details**:  \n  - Woman in gray: Her dress has a loose, flowy fit (use curved lines to indicate fabric drape).  \n  - Man: His cargo shorts have visible stitching on the pockets (add small lines for texture).  \n  - Woman in red: Her jacket is slightly open, revealing the white tank top underneath (use a \"cutout\" shape for the jacket front).  \n\n\n### **6. Critical Notes for SVG Reproduction**\nTo ensure accuracy, the following guidelines must be followed:  \n- **Proportions**:  \n  - The main display case should be ~2x taller than the average figure (e.g., 6.5 ft tall vs. 5.5 ft for the woman in gray).  \n  - Shelf spacing in the main case must be even (12–18 in between shelves).  \n  - The clock should be centered horizontally above the secondary display case, with its bottom edge ~1 ft above the case’s top.  \n- **Lighting**:  \n  - Use a **radial gradient** for the main display case’s internal lighting (warm yellow at the center of each shelf, fading to pale yellow at the edges).  \n  - The fluorescent ceiling light should cast a subtle **linear gradient** (cool white) on the ceiling and nearby walls.  \n- **Reflections**:  \n  - Add a **semi-transparent white rectangle** (50% opacity) to the main display case’s glass to mimic the ceiling light reflection.  \n  - The frozen food case’s glass should have a faint reflection of the room (e.g., a small white shape to represent the fluorescent light).  \n- **Textures**:  \n  - For the black leather bag, use a **noise pattern** (subtle grain) to mimic leather texture.  \n  - For the denim shorts, add **dashed lines** to indicate distressing at the hem.  \n  - For pastries with nuts, use a **scatter pattern** (small tan circles) to represent nut pieces.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately capture the warmth, texture, and layout of the original bakery scene.",
  "v1_144": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description covers all critical elements, including geometry, color, spatial relationships, and artistic style. The image is a wide-shot (16:9 aspect ratio) of an indoor basketball arena with three key foreground/middle-ground subjects: a woman in a red dress (left), a basketball hoop (center-right), and a shirtless man (right background). The background features tiered seating, stairs, and arena infrastructure.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is structured around three primary focal points, with the arena as a supporting backdrop:\n\n#### **Foreground: Woman (Left)**\n- **Pose**: Facing the basketball hoop, back to the camera. Mid-movement, with arms raised above her head (elbows bent at ~90°), hands clenched (suggesting she just released a basketball). Hair and dress are blurred to indicate motion (e.g., jumping or spinning).\n- **Body**: Slim, hourglass figure. Dress is form-fitting with a **vertical zipper** running down the center of the back (thin, dark line).\n- **Hair**: Long, wavy blonde hair (shoulder-to-waist length) flowing backward with motion blur.\n- **Accessories**: Small silver bracelet on her right wrist (thin, circular shape).\n\n#### **Middle Ground: Basketball Hoop (Center-Right)**\nThe hoop is a regulation-size assembly with the following components:\n- **Backboard**: Rectangular (1.83m x 1.07m, per NBA standards), dark green (#006400) with a white metal frame and diagonal support bars (forming a \"V\" shape behind the rim). A small **American flag sticker** (10cm x 6cm) is affixed to the **right edge** of the backboard, near the top.\n- **Rim**: Circular (45.7cm diameter), white (#FFFFFF), with a net attached.\n- **Net**: White (#F0F0F0) string mesh, hanging ~40cm from the rim.\n- **Scoreboard**: Mounted atop the backboard (0.6m x 0.4m), dark blue (#000080) background with two lines of **7-segment digital digits** (white, #FFFFFF). Both lines display \"88\" (likely game time or scores).\n- **Base**: Green (#006400) rectangular prism (1.2m x 1.2m x 2.4m) supporting the backboard. A small, indistinct logo (e.g., \"Spalding\") is centered on the front of the base.\n\n#### **Background: Man (Right)**\n- **Pose**: Standing upright, feet shoulder-width apart, hands at his sides. Facing the woman, with a neutral expression.\n- **Appearance**: Shirtless (muscular build), wearing blue jeans (#0000CD). Short brown hair, clean-shaven.\n\n#### **Arena Backdrop**\n- **Seating**: Two tiers of **yellow plastic seats** (#E6BE00) arranged in tight rows/columns. Lower tier (closer to the court) is well-lit; upper tier (further back) is darker.\n- **Stairs**: Left side, leading to the upper tier, with white railings (#FFFFFF).\n- **Infrastructure**: Upper level has glass railings, metal supports, and a \"Citizens Bank\" sign (partially legible, right background).\n- **Lighting**: Overhead warm-white lights (soft glow) highlight the woman and hoop; background is dimmed.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are vibrant and contrasting, with warm tones (red, yellow) drawing attention to the foreground. Textures vary to simulate real-world materials:\n\n| Element               | Color (Hex)       | Texture/Visual Property                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Woman’s dress         | #FF1414 (vivid red) | Smooth, satin-like finish with a **thin black zipper** (down the back).                  |\n| Woman’s hair          | #FEE1C7 (pale blonde) | Wavy, with motion blur (gradient transparency from center to edges).                   |\n| Basketball backboard  | #006400 (dark green) | Glossy, with subtle light reflection (gradient from dark green to #008000 at the top).  |\n| Rim                   | #FFFFFF (white)   | Matte metal, slightly worn.                                                            |\n| Net                   | #F0F0F0 (light gray) | Thin string mesh (12 loops, spaced evenly).                                             |\n| Scoreboard            | #000080 (dark blue) | Digital display with **white 7-segment digits** (\"88\" x 2).                              |\n| Seats                 | #E6BE00 (dark gold) | Matte plastic, with a grid pattern (rows/columns).                                      |\n| Man’s jeans           | #0000CD (medium blue) | Denim texture (subtle stitching lines).                                                 |\n| Man’s skin            | #F0D0B0 (light tan) | Smooth, with soft shadows (under arms/neck).                                            |\n| American flag         | #FF0000 (red), #FFFFFF (white), #0000FF (blue) | Small, rectangular sticker (10cm x 6cm) with crisp stripes/stars.                       |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **depth of field** to separate foreground (sharp) from background (softly blurred). Key spatial relationships:\n\n- **Woman**:占据 the **left 1/3** of the image. She is closer to the camera than the hoop, making her appear larger (1.7m tall, scaled to 150% of the hoop’s base height). Her arms reach toward the hoop, aligning her hands with the rim’s height (3.05m, regulation).\n- **Basketball Hoop**: Centered in the **right 1/3** of the image. The backboard is 1.83m tall (regulation), with the scoreboard (0.6m tall) mounted atop it. The base is 2.4m tall, anchoring the assembly to the court.\n- **Man**: Standing in the **right 1/3** of the background, behind the hoop. He is smaller (scaled to 50% of the woman’s height) due to distance, with his gaze fixed on the woman.\n- **Seating**: Lower tier seats fill the space between the woman and hoop; upper tier seats frame the top and sides of the image.\n- **Court**: Visible at the bottom edge (green floor with a faint yellow logo, partially cut off).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph** with a cinematic feel, enhanced by:\n- **Motion Blur**: Applied to the woman’s hair and dress to convey movement (e.g., jumping or spinning).\n- **Depth of Field**: Foreground (woman/hoop) is in sharp focus; background (man/seats) is softly blurred to direct attention.\n- **Lighting**: Warm overhead lights create dramatic highlights (e.g., on the woman’s dress and backboard) and deep shadows (e.g., under the hoop’s base).\n- **Color Contrast**: The woman’s red dress contrasts sharply with the green backboard and yellow seats, making her the most prominent subject.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Scoreboard**: Two lines of white 7-segment digits, both displaying \"88\" (likely game time or tied scores). The scoreboard is a rectangular box (0.6m x 0.4m) mounted atop the backboard.\n- **American Flag**: A small (10cm x 6cm) sticker on the **right edge of the backboard**, near the top. It features red/white stripes (vertical) and a blue field with white stars.\n- **Bracelet**: The woman wears a thin silver bracelet (#C0C0C0) on her right wrist (visible as a small circle).\n- **Logo**: The hoop’s green base has a faint, indistinct logo (e.g., \"Spalding\") centered on the front (too small to read clearly in the image).\n- **Stairs**: Left side, with white railings (#FFFFFF) and dark steps (leading to the upper tier).\n\n\n### **6. Critical SVG Notes for Accurate Reproduction**\nTo recreate the image as an SVG, prioritize the following:\n- **Layering**: Order elements from foreground to background:  \n  `Woman > Hoop (backboard/rim/net) > Hoop base > Lower seats > Man > Upper seats > Arena infrastructure`.\n- **Motion Blur**: Use gradient transparency (from opaque to 0% opacity) on the woman’s hair and dress edges to simulate movement.\n- **Geometry**:  \n  - Backboard: 1.83m (height) x 1.07m (width) rectangle with a white frame and diagonal support bars.  \n  - Rim: 45.7cm diameter circle, centered on the backboard.  \n  - Net: 12 white strings (curved) hanging from the rim, forming a cone shape.  \n  - Scoreboard: 0.6m (height) x 0.4m (width) rectangle with two 0.15m-tall \"88\" digits.  \n- **Color Consistency**: Use the hex codes provided for all elements to match the image’s vibrancy.\n- **Symbols**: The American flag must be a small, rectangular sticker on the backboard’s right edge (not a full-size flag).\n- **Text**: The scoreboard’s \"88\" digits must be 7-segment displays (not sans-serif font).\n\n\n### **Summary of Key Measurements (for SVG Scaling)**\n| Element               | Real-World Size | SVG Scale (Relative to Woman) |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Woman                 | 1.7m tall       | 100% (base unit)              |\n| Backboard             | 1.83m tall      | 107% of woman’s height        |\n| Rim                   | 45.7cm diameter | 27% of woman’s height         |\n| Scoreboard            | 0.6m tall       | 35% of woman’s height         |\n| Man                   | 1.8m tall       | 50% of woman’s height (distance) |\n| American Flag         | 10cm x 6cm      | 6% x 3.5% of woman’s height   |\n\n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately reflect the image’s composition, color, and artistic style. The most critical elements for realism are the motion blur (woman’s hair/dress), depth of field (focus), and precise geometric proportions (hoop, scoreboard).",
  "v1_145": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, we’ll break down the composition into **main objects**, **geometric shapes**, **colors/textures**, **spatial relationships**, **style**, and **specific details**—all critical for precise vector rendering. The image is a cinematic still featuring two characters (a woman and a boy) in an intimate face-to-face interaction, set against a wall with a closed door.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition centers on **two human figures** (foreground) and a **background environment** (walls + door). Key shapes are defined below:\n\n#### **Foreground: Characters**\n- **Woman (Left)**:  \n  - **Head**: Oval (profile view, facing right).  \n  - **Hair**: Closed, wavy path with volume at the crown and layers falling to the shoulders. The shape follows natural curves (e.g., a slight lift at the front, waves cascading down the back).  \n  - **Torso**: Rectangular jacket (loose fit, covering her upper body) with a collared blouse underneath.  \n  - **Necklace**: Thin, curved line (chain) around the neck (subtle, not prominent).  \n\n- **Boy (Right)**:  \n  - **Head**: Oval (profile view, facing left).  \n  - **Hair**: Closed, short path with a straight hairline and minimal volume (neck visible).  \n  - **Torso**: Rectangular blazer (slim fit, buttoned at the front) over a white collared shirt and a long, narrow tie.  \n  - **Tie**: Long, rectangular shape (extends from the collar to the waist) with a plaid pattern.  \n\n#### **Background: Environment**\n- **Door**: Large rectangle (center background) with a **vertical hinge** (small rectangle) in its exact middle.  \n- **Walls**:  \n  - **Left Wall**: Large rectangle (covers the left 30% of the image) with a textured surface (wallpaper).  \n  - **Right Wall**: Large rectangle (covers the right 30% of the image) with a smooth, painted surface.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are muted and realistic, with subtle textures to mimic fabric, hair, and walls. Below are hex codes (approximate) and texture notes:\n\n#### **Woman**\n- **Hair**: Auburn (#A52A2A) with golden highlights (#DAA520) to emphasize waves.  \n- **Jacket**: Tweed texture with a mix of brown (#8B4513), gray (#A9A9A9), and cream (#FFF8DC) woven together. The pattern is subtle—use a **pattern fill** in SVG to replicate the woven effect.  \n- **Blouse**: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with a collared neckline (buttoned at the top).  \n- **Necklace**: Thin gold chain (#FFD700) with a tiny, indistinct pendant (optional, as it’s barely visible).  \n\n#### **Boy**\n- **Hair**: Light brown (#8B4513) with a straight, cropped style (neck visible).  \n- **Blazer**: Deep maroon (#800020) with a smooth, slightly shiny texture (use a **linear gradient** from #800020 to #600015 for depth).  \n- **Shirt**: Bright white (#FFFFFF) with a crisp collar (buttoned at the top).  \n- **Tie**: Plaid pattern with red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), white (#FFFFFF), and gray (#808080) in a crisscross (tartan) design. The pattern should repeat seamlessly along the tie’s length.  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Door**: Light gray-beige (#D3D3D3) with a matte finish.  \n- **Hinge**: Brass (#B8860B) with a subtle patina (use a **radial gradient** to mimic metallic sheen).  \n- **Left Wall**: Dark gray (#808080) with a **subtle noise texture** (SVG `filter: url(#noise)` ) to replicate textured wallpaper.  \n- **Right Wall**: Light gray (#C0C0C0) with a smooth, flat finish (solid color).  \n\n#### **Lighting & Shadows**\n- **Key Light**: From the **right side** (boy’s face is well-lit, woman’s face is in partial shadow).  \n  - **Boy**: Right cheek/forehead bright (#FFFFFF), left side (near the door) softly shadowed (#606060).  \n  - **Woman**: Right cheek (facing the boy) slightly lit (#D3D3D3), left side (facing the wall) darker (#404040).  \n- **Shadows**:  \n  - Under the woman’s hair (soft #404040 gradient).  \n  - Under the boy’s blazer collar (subtle #600015 gradient).  \n  - Around the door frame (light #A9A9A9 shadow on the walls).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **intimate** and **symmetrical**, with the two characters facing each other and the door dividing the frame. Use the following guidelines for layout:\n\n#### **Characters**\n- **Woman**:占据 the **left 30%** of the image.  \n  - **Position**: Standing slightly leaning toward the boy (body turned 45° toward the center).  \n  - **Height**: ~85% of the boy’s height (her head reaches the boy’s chin).  \n  - **Eye Line**: Aligned with the boy’s eyes (they are making direct eye contact).  \n- **Boy**:占据 the **right 30%** of the image.  \n  - **Position**: Standing straight, facing the woman (body turned 20° toward the center).  \n  - **Height**: ~100% of the image height (head touches the top edge).  \n  - **Eye Line**: Aligned with the woman’s eyes.  \n\n#### **Door**\n- **Position**: Center of the image (covers the middle 40% of the width).  \n- **Size**: Taller than both characters (extends from the bottom of the image to the top).  \n- **Hinge**: Exact center of the door (vertical alignment), 1/10th the door’s height (e.g., 100px tall door → 10px hinge).  \n\n#### **Walls**\n- **Left Wall**: Behind the woman (covers left 30% of the image, from bottom to top).  \n- **Right Wall**: Behind the boy (covers right 30% of the image, from bottom to top).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic cinematic still** with:  \n- **Soft, ambient lighting**: No harsh shadows (mimics natural/room light).  \n- **Focus on character interaction**: The frame tightens on their faces/upper bodies to emphasize emotion.  \n- **Subtle depth**: Foreground (characters) → midground (door) → background (walls) using slight size/opacity differences.  \n- **Natural proportions**: Characters have realistic body ratios (e.g., boy’s head is 1/7th his height, woman’s head is 1/6th her height).  \n\nFor SVG, replicate this style using:  \n- **Gradients**: To add depth to fabric (blazer, jacket) and shadows.  \n- **Patterns**: For the woman’s tweed jacket and boy’s plaid tie.  \n- **Filters**: For wall texture (noise) and soft shadows (blur).  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Critical for Accuracy)**\nThese small elements define the characters and environment—omit them at your peril!\n\n#### **Woman**\n- **Hair**: Wavy with a **side part** (left side of her head, from the viewer’s perspective). Volume at the crown (path curves outward).  \n- **Necklace**: Thin chain (#FFD700) lying flat against her collarbone (path follows the curve of her neck).  \n- **Jacket**: Loose fit—path extends slightly beyond her shoulders (width: ~1.5x her head). Sleeves are not visible (cropped at the elbows).  \n\n#### **Boy**\n- **Blazer**: Single button (#800020) closed at the waist (path: small circle/rectangle at the center front).  \n- **Tie**: Long (reaches his waist) and narrow (width: 1/10th his chest). Plaid pattern repeats every 20px (adjust based on tie length).  \n- **Hair**: Short—path ends at the base of his neck (exposes the back of his collar).  \n\n#### **Door**\n- **Hinge**: Rectangular (#B8860B) with rounded edges. Positioned **exactly in the center** of the door (vertical alignment).  \n- **Door Frame**: Thin (#A9A9A9) border around the door (path: 2px stroke around the door rectangle).  \n\n#### **Walls**\n- **Left Wall**: Texture is **subtle**—use a low-opacity (#808080) noise filter (SVG `feTurbulence` ) to avoid distracting from the characters.  \n- **Right Wall**: Smooth—solid color (#C0C0C0) with no texture (focuses attention on the boy’s face).  \n\n\n### **SVG Technical Guidelines**\nTo translate the above into a usable SVG, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Layer Order**:  \n   - **Background**: Left wall → Right wall → Door.  \n   - **Foreground**: Woman → Boy (boy is slightly in front of the door, woman is slightly in front of the left wall).  \n\n2. **Shapes**:  \n   - **Characters**: Use **closed paths** for hair, jacket/blazer, and shirts. Use **strokes** for collars, ties, and necklaces (1-2px width).  \n   - **Door**: Rectangle with a 2px (#A9A9A9) stroke (door frame). Hinge: Rectangle with a 1px (#B8860B) stroke and solid fill.  \n   - **Walls**: Large rectangles (left/right) with texture/color as defined.  \n\n3. **Patterns**:  \n   - **Tweed Jacket**: Create a **pattern element** (`<pattern id=\"tweed\">`) with small rectangles/squares in brown, gray, and cream. Repeat the pattern across the woman’s jacket path.  \n   - **Plaid Tie**: Create a **pattern element** (`<pattern id=\"plaid\">`) with crisscross lines in red, blue, white, and gray. Repeat the pattern along the tie’s path.  \n\n4. **Gradients**:  \n   - **Boy’s Blazer**: Linear gradient (`<linearGradient id=\"blazer\">`) from #800020 (top) to #600015 (bottom) for depth.  \n   - **Shadows**: Radial/linear gradients (`<radialGradient id=\"shadow\">`) with low opacity (#404040) for soft shadows under hair/collars.  \n\n5. **Filters**:  \n   - **Left Wall Texture**: Use `<filter id=\"noise\">` with `feTurbulence` (baseFrequency: 0.02) to add subtle wallpaper texture.  \n   - **Soft Shadows**: Use `<filter id=\"blur\">` with `feGaussianBlur` (stdDeviation: 1) to blur shadow gradients.  \n\n6. **Proportions**:  \n   - **Canvas Size**: Use a **16:9 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1920x1080) to match cinematic framing.  \n   - **Character Sizes**:  \n     - Boy: Height = 1000px (1080px canvas), Width = 400px.  \n     - Woman: Height = 850px, Width = 450px (looser jacket fit).  \n\n\n### **Final Checklist (Before Export)**\n- [ ] Woman’s hair has volume and a side part.  \n- [ ] Boy’s tie has a plaid pattern (correct colors/repetition).  \n- [ ] Door hinge is centered and brass-colored.  \n- [ ] Left wall has a subtle noise texture.  \n- [ ] Lighting: Boy’s right cheek is bright, woman’s left cheek is shadowed.  \n- [ ] Proportions: Woman is shorter than the boy (her head reaches his chin).  \n- [ ] Layer Order: Characters are in front of the background.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, your SVG will be a **faithful reproduction** of the image—capturing the intimacy, lighting, and细节 that make the original so compelling.",
  "v1_146": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, we need a detailed breakdown of its components, focusing on **geometric shapes**, **proportions**, **perspective**, and **period-accurate details**. The scene depicts a long, ornate Regency-era hallway with four people walking toward a distant, light-filled opening. Below is a structured description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is dominated by a **linear, rectangular hallway** (length ≈ 6–7x its width) with a high ceiling. Key objects are grouped by foreground, middle ground, and background:\n\n#### **Foreground (Closest to Viewer)**\n- **Four People** (walking away from the viewer, aligned roughly in a horizontal plane):  \n  - **Leftmost Woman**: Wears a **gray A-line dress** (floor-length, high brown collar, long sleeves) with a **small brown hat** (perched on a bun).  \n  - **Second Woman**: Wears a **brown long-sleeved top** paired with a **full white linen skirt** (floor-length) and a **tall red hat** (round, structured).  \n  - **Third Woman**: Wears a **brown floor-length dress** (simple cut) with a **white mob cap** (tied under the chin) and a **white lace collar**.  \n  - **Rightmost Man**: Wears a **long green wool coat** (floor-length, loose fit) with **beige knee breeches** and **brown leather boots**. He holds a **wooden cane** (right hand) and a **brown top hat** (left hand, hanging).  \n\n- **Left Wall Furniture**:  \n  - A **light blue armchair** (curved back, four dark wooden legs, padded seat) against the wall.  \n  - A **white fireplace mantel** (rectangular, 1.2m high) with a **red tassel** (right end). Above it: three **large gold-framed paintings** (dark backgrounds). On the mantel: two **tall gold urns** (left/right) and a **small blue-and-white porcelain vase** (center).  \n\n#### **Middle Ground**\n- **Left Wall**:  \n  - A **tall black cabinet** (narrow, rectangular) flanked by two **decorative marble stands** (cylindrical, carved) holding gold urns.  \n- **Right Wall**:  \n  - A **long wooden table** (gold-trimmed) with a **large silver candelabrum** (12+ glass arms, central floral motif) and small decorative items (e.g., a black statue).  \n  - A **light blue settee** (simple design) against the wall.  \n- **Hallway Center**:  \n  - Empty space, emphasizing the hallway’s length.  \n\n#### **Background (Distant End)**\n- **Far Wall**:  \n  - Two **tall, narrow windows** (sheer white curtains) allowing natural light. Flanked by **small gold-framed paintings** (4 total).  \n  - A **gold chandelier** (8–10 curved arms, unlit candles) hanging from the ceiling.  \n- **Ceiling**:  \n  - An **ornate oval medallion** (central, 1.5m wide) with scrollwork and floral patterns (gold/gray). Two additional chandeliers (smaller, matching the foreground one) hang along the centerline.  \n\n#### **Walls (Both Sides)**\n- **Paneling**: Pale pink base with **white rectangular trim** (horizontal and vertical lines dividing the wall into 0.5m–1m sections).  \n- **Paintings**: Rows of **gold-framed rectangles** (dark interiors) decreasing in size as they recede (left wall: 8–10 paintings; right wall: 6–8 paintings).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n| Element | Color | Texture |\n|---------|-------|---------|\n| **Walls** | Pale pink (base) + white (trim) | Smooth, matte (paneled). |\n| **Ceiling** | Off-white (base) + gold/gray (decor) | Smooth, with subtle raised patterns (medallion). |\n| **Carpet** | Light beige (base) + dark beige (thin horizontal stripes) | Woven, textured. |\n| **Armchair/Settee** | Light blue | Soft, padded (matte). |\n| **Fireplace Mantel** | White | Smooth, matte. |\n| **Paintings** | Gold (frames) + dark gray/black (interiors) | Frames: shiny; canvases: matte. |\n| **Chandeliers** | Gold (metal) + clear (glass, candelabrum) | Shiny, metallic (chandeliers); reflective (candelabrum). |\n| **Clothing** | - Gray dress (matte) + brown (collar/cuffs)<br>- Brown top (shiny silk) + white skirt (linen, matte)<br>- Brown dress (matte) + white cap (linen, matte)<br>- Green coat (wool, thick matte) + beige breeches (linen, matte) | Varied: flowy (skirts), structured (coats), soft (caps). |\n| **Decorative Items** | Gold (urns), blue-and-white (vase), silver (candelabrum) | Shiny (metals), matte (porcelain). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses **linear perspective** with a **vanishing point** at the center of the far-end windows. All parallel lines (walls, floor, ceiling) converge here, creating depth. Key spatial rules:  \n- **Foreground Elements**: Larger and more detailed (e.g., the armchair, the four people).  \n- **Middle Ground Elements**: Smaller than foreground, positioned further back (e.g., the black cabinet, right-wall table).  \n- **Background Elements**: Smallest, concentrated at the vanishing point (e.g., far windows, chandeliers).  \n\n#### **Perspective Scaling**\n- **People**: Height ≈ 1.6–1.8m (man tallest). Scale decreases by ~20% for each 1/3 of the hallway’s length.  \n- **Paintings**: Foreground paintings (left wall) = 1.5m tall × 1m wide; background paintings = 0.3m tall × 0.2m wide.  \n- **Chandeliers**: Foreground chandelier = 1m wide; background chandeliers = 0.5m wide.  \n\n#### **Relative Placement**\n- **People**: Spaced evenly across the hallway (left-to-right: 20%, 35%, 60%, 75% of the image width).  \n- **Left Wall Armchair**: 10% from the left edge, 60% from the bottom (floor level).  \n- **Fireplace Mantel**: 25% from the left edge, 55% from the bottom (aligns with the second woman’s shoulders).  \n- **Far Windows**: 65% from the left edge, 40% from the bottom (center of the vanishing point).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Period**: Regency era (early 19th century), evident in the clothing (high-waisted dresses, long coats) and decor (ornate chandeliers, paneled walls).  \n- **Style**: **Realistic** with a focus on **historical accuracy**. The composition uses **symmetry** (balanced wall decor, centered hallway) and **leading lines** (floor/ceiling edges) to guide the viewer’s eye to the far end.  \n- **Lighting**: Natural light dominates from the far windows, creating soft shadows and emphasizing the hallway’s depth. Side windows (right wall) contribute subtle ambient light.  \n- **Mood**: Grand, serene, and slightly formal—reflecting the wealth of the setting.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text**: None visible.  \n- **Symbols**: The ornate decor (paintings, chandeliers, furniture) signifies **wealth and status**. The Regency-era clothing (e.g., mob caps, long coats) indicates the time period.  \n- **Specific Details**:  \n  - The man in the green coat is **looking upward** (head tilted back), likely at the ceiling medallion.  \n  - The second woman’s red hat is **structured** (not a loose mob cap), distinguishing her from the third woman’s simpler white cap.  \n  - The candelabrum on the right table has **12+ glass arms** (symmetrical, branching from a central stem).  \n  - The fireplace mantel has a **red tassel** (15cm long) hanging from its right end—an often-overlooked decorative touch.  \n  - The carpet’s stripes are **thin** (≈5cm wide) and **horizontal**, running parallel to the hallway’s length.  \n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, the SVG must adhere to **linear perspective** (vanishing point at the far-end windows) and **geometric precision**. Below are critical technical specifications:\n\n#### **Perspective**\n- **Vanishing Point**: (x: 50%, y: 40%) of the image (center of the far-end windows).  \n- **Parallel Lines**: All walls, floor edges, and ceiling trim converge at this point.  \n- **Scale**: Foreground elements (e.g., armchair, people) are 1.5–2x larger than background elements (e.g., distant chandeliers, paintings).  \n\n#### **Shapes**\n- **Walls**: Rectangles with white trim (use `<rect>` elements for panels, `<line>` for trim).  \n- **Carpet**: A large rectangle with a **striped pattern** (use `<pattern>` for repeating horizontal stripes).  \n- **People**: Use `<path>` elements to define dress/coat silhouettes (e.g., the second woman’s white skirt is a full A-line shape; the man’s coat is a loose rectangle with long sleeves).  \n- **Chandeliers**: Symmetrical shapes (use `<circle>` for the central body, `<path>` for curved arms, `<rect>` for candles).  \n- **Paintings**: Rectangles with gold frames (use `<rect>` for the frame, `<rect>` for the dark canvas; stack them to create depth).  \n\n#### **Colors**\n- Use **hex codes** for consistency (e.g., pale pink: `#f0e6e6`; white trim: `#ffffff`; gold: `#d4af37`; light blue: `#add8e6`).  \n- **Textures**: Represent with SVG patterns (e.g., carpet stripes: `<pattern id=\"stripes\" width=\"0.1\" height=\"1\" patternUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\"><rect width=\"0.05\" height=\"1\" fill=\"#f5f0e6\"/><rect x=\"0.05\" width=\"0.05\" height=\"1\" fill=\"#e0d0b0\"/></pattern>`).  \n\n#### **Layout**\n- **Viewport**: Set to a **16:9 aspect ratio** (e.g., `width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"`) to match the image’s horizontal composition.  \n- **Layers**: Organize elements by depth (foreground → background) using `<g>` (group) elements (e.g., `<g id=\"foreground\">` for people/armchair; `<g id=\"background\">` for distant windows/chandeliers).  \n\n#### **Examples of Critical Elements**\n- **Second Woman’s Dress**:  \n  ```svg\n  <g id=\"woman-2\">\n    <path d=\"M350 500 Q375 400 400 500\" fill=\"#8b4513\" /> <!-- Brown top -->\n    <path d=\"M340 500 Q375 600 410 500\" fill=\"#ffffff\" /> <!-- White skirt -->\n    <circle cx=\"375\" cy=\"350\" r=\"30\" fill=\"#8b0000\" /> <!-- Red hat -->\n  </g>\n  ```\n- **Candelabrum**:  \n  ```svg\n  <g id=\"candelabrum\">\n    <path d=\"M850 500 Q875 450 900 500\" fill=\"#c0c0c0\" /> <!-- Central stem -->\n    <path d=\"M875 450 Q860 420 845 450\" fill=\"#c0c0c0\" /> <!-- Left arm -->\n    <path d=\"M875 450 Q890 420 905 450\" fill=\"#c0c0c0\" /> <!-- Right arm -->\n    <!-- Repeat for 10+ arms -->\n    <rect x=\"845\" y=\"420\" width=\"5\" height=\"15\" fill=\"#ffffff\" /> <!-- Candle -->\n    <rect x=\"905\" y=\"420\" width=\"5\" height=\"15\" fill=\"#ffffff\" /> <!-- Candle -->\n  </g>\n  ```\n\n\n### **Final Notes**\nThe SVG must prioritize **geometric accuracy** (e.g., the armchair’s curved back, the man’s cane shape) and **perspective consistency** (e.g., paintings decreasing in size). Use **groups** to organize elements for easy editing (e.g., `<g id=\"left-wall\">` for all left-wall objects) and **patterns** for textures (carpet, wall paneling). Period-accurate details (e.g., the red tassel on the mantel, the man’s top hat) are critical to capturing the image’s character.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will faithfully reproduce the image’s grandeur, period charm, and spatial depth.",
  "v1_147": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, below is a detailed, structured description focusing on **geometric precision, spatial relationships, texture, color, and period-specific details**. The image has a **vintage cinematic tone** (likely 1920s–1930s formal wear) with a warm, nostalgic color palette and shallow depth of field.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition centers on **two foreground figures** (a man and a woman) in formal attire, surrounded by a blurred background of guests and architectural details. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground: Central Couple**\n##### **Man (Left)**\n- **Outfit**:  \n  - **White Suit Jacket**: Single-breasted, with a straight collar, narrow lapels (≈2–3 inches wide), and **two visible front buttons** (at chest and waist level).

Fingers are wrapped around the stem (thumb on top, index/middle fingers below), with the flute tilted slightly forward.  \n  - **Left Arm**: Relaxed at his side (partially obscured by the woman).  \n\n##### **Woman (Right)**\n- **Outfit**:  \n  - **White Chiffon Dress**: Short-sleeved (hitting at the upper arm), with a **round neckline** and a fitted bodice. The skirt is slightly flared (only the upper portion is visible). Subtle **floral embroidery** (small white/cream flowers) adorns the bodice.  \n  - **Headpiece**: A delicate circlet of **white flowers** (3–4 small roses/daisies) and **baby’s breath**, woven into her hair. The arrangement is centered on the top of her head, extending to the sides with trailing foliage.  \n- **Jewelry**:  \n  - **Pearl Necklace**: Single strand of small pearls (≈10–12 mm in diameter), resting on her collarbone.  \n  - **Silver Watch**: Rectangular face (≈1.5:1 length-to-width ratio) with a link band (small rectangular links), worn on her **left wrist** (face facing outward).  \n  - **Gold Ring**: Thin, simple band on her **left ring finger** (traditional wedding ring finger).  \n- **Pose**:  \n  - Standing close to the man (shoulders almost touching), looking to her **left** (viewer’s right) with a slight smile.  \n  - **Left Hand**: Raised to mouth level, holding a **champagne flute** (see *Flutes* below). Fingers are wrapped around the stem (thumb on top, index/middle fingers below), with the flute tilted toward her lips (liquid visible inside).  \n  - **Right Arm**: Relaxed at her side (partially obscured by the man).  \n\n##### **Flutes (Both)**\n- **Shape**: Classic champagne flute with a **tall stem** (≈4 inches long), **narrow bowl** (≈1.5 inches tall, 0.75 inches wide at the top), and **round base** (≈1 inch in diameter).  \n- **Liquid**: Pale yellow (champagne) with a slight glow. The man’s flute is **1/3 full**; the woman’s is **1/2 full**.  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Curtains**: Tall, vertical, and draped, framing the left and right sides of the image. They have a **textured woven pattern** with evenly spaced vertical folds (≈2–3 inches apart). The curtains extend from the top of the image to the bottom, with a slight curve on the left and a straighter line on the right.  \n- **Guests**: Blurred figures (4–5 visible) standing behind the central couple. They wear **dark formal attire** (black, dark brown) with subtle white accents (e.g., a shawl on the left guest, a patterned jacket on the right guest). Only their heads and shoulders are visible, with no distinct facial features (due to shallow depth of field).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **warm and muted**, with a golden-cream base and soft accents. Textures are tailored to reflect period-specific fabrics (linen, chiffon) and cinematic lighting.\n\n| Element | Color (Hex/RGB) | Texture/Visual Notes |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| **Central Couple’s Attire** | Ivory/cream (#F0E6D6 to #E8D7C3) | Man’s suit: Smooth, slightly matte (linen-like). Woman’s dress: Translucent chiffon with subtle floral embroidery (use light, delicate patterns). |\n| **Man’s Boutonniere** | Soft pink (#F8D7DA) | Slightly textured (petal details) with tiny green leaves (#E6F9E6). |\n| **Woman’s Headpiece** | White (#FFF) with pale green (#E6F9E6) foliage | Delicate, lace-like texture (baby’s breath) and soft floral shapes. |\n| **Flute Liquid** | Pale yellow (#FFF3CD) | Subtle glow (use a linear gradient from center to edge to mimic light refraction). |\n| **Curtains** | Beige (#E6D9C3 to #D4C2A8) | Woven texture with vertical ridges (use stripe patterns with subtle gradients). |\n| **Background Guests** | Dark neutrals (#2F2F2F to #4D4D4D) | Muted, blurred (low opacity + Gaussian blur) to emphasize depth of field. White accents (#F0E6D6) for shawls/patterns. |\n| **Jewelry** | Pearl necklace (#F0E6D6); Silver watch (#C0C0C0); Gold ring (#FFD700) | Pearls: Slightly iridescent. Watch: Matte metal with link band texture. Ring: Shiny, thin band. |\n| **Lighting** | Warm golden glow (#FFE4B5) | Soft, diffused light from the front/above. Subtle **vignetting** (darker edges: #D4AF37 to #B8860B) to draw focus to the couple. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **balanced and centered**, with the couple occupying the middle 1/3 of the image. Depth of field creates a clear hierarchy:  \n- **Foreground**: Central couple (sharp focus).  \n- **Midground**: Blurred guests (partially obscured by the couple).  \n- **Background**: Curtains (soft focus, framing the scene).  \n\n#### **Key Spatial Details**\n- **Couple’s Placement**: The man stands on the **left** (60% of the foreground width), the woman on the **right** (40%). Their shoulders are almost touching, with the man’s right arm slightly overlapping the woman’s left shoulder.  \n- **Hand Positions**:  \n  - Man’s right hand (holding flute) is raised to **chest level** (≈1/3 of the image height from the top), slightly in front of his body.  \n  - Woman’s left hand (holding flute) is raised to **mouth level** (≈1/2 of the image height from the top), with the flute tilted toward her lips.  \n- **Curtains**: The left curtain covers the left 1/4 of the image; the right curtain covers the right 1/4. They extend from the top edge to the bottom, with folds aligned vertically.  \n- **Guests**: Positioned behind the couple, with their heads at the same level as the couple’s shoulders. The left guest is partially obscured by the man’s arm; the right guest is partially obscured by the woman’s head.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **vintage cinematic style** (likely inspired by 1920s–1930s period dramas) with the following key traits:  \n- **Warm Color Grading**: Golden-cream tones with subtle sepia undertones, evoking nostalgia.  \n- **Shallow Depth of Field**: The central couple is in sharp focus, while the background (guests, curtains) is blurred. This creates depth and draws attention to the main subjects.  \n- **Soft Lighting**: Diffused front lighting with no harsh shadows, giving a romantic, dreamlike quality. Subtle vignetting (darker edges) frames the couple.  \n- **Period Accuracy**: The man’s high-collared shirt, bow tie, and waistcoat; the woman’s short-sleeved chiffon dress and Art Deco-style watch (rectangular face, link band) are consistent with 1920s–1930s formal wear.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThere is no text in the image, but **symbolic and period-specific details** are critical for accuracy:  \n\n| Detail | Description | SVG Implementation Notes |\n|--------|-------------|--------------------------|\n| **Man’s Bow Tie** | Large, loose bow with two long tails (≈6 inches). The tails hang straight down the front of the waistcoat. | Use two overlapping oval shapes for the bow loops and two rectangular tails. Add a small \"knot\" in the center. |\n| **Woman’s Watch** | Rectangular face (1.5:1 ratio) with a link band (10–12 small rectangular links). Worn on the **left wrist** (face facing outward). | Draw the face as a rectangle with rounded corners; the band as a series of connected rectangles. Add a subtle \"glass\" reflection (light gradient) to the face. |\n| **Woman’s Ring** | Thin, simple gold band on the **left ring finger** (third finger from the thumb). | Draw a small circle (≈2 mm in diameter) with a slight shine (gradient from center to edge). |\n| **Flute Shape** | Tall stem (≈4 inches), narrow bowl (≈1.5 inches tall), round base (≈1 inch diameter). The bowl tapers slightly toward the top. | Use a rectangle for the stem, an oval for the bowl, and a circle for the base. Add a subtle \"glass\" texture (light gradient) to the bowl. |\n| **Headpiece Arrangement** | Flowers and baby’s breath are woven into the woman’s hair (parted in the middle, pulled back into a low bun). The largest flowers are on the **right side** (viewer’s right) of her head. | Draw the headpiece as a curved band (following the top of her head) with small circles (flowers) and thin lines (baby’s breath). Add subtle green leaves between flowers. |\n| **Vignetting** | Darker edges (≈10% opacity) to frame the couple. The vignetting is most pronounced at the corners. | Use a radial gradient from the center (transparent) to the edges (#D4AF37 at 10% opacity). |\n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Technical Notes**\nTo replicate the image’s cinematic feel and geometric precision, follow these guidelines:  \n\n#### **Layers**\n- **Foreground**: Central couple (man, woman, flutes) – **sharp focus** (no blur).  \n- **Midground**: Guests – **soft blur** (Gaussian blur: 2–3 pixels) and **low opacity** (70–80%) to simulate depth of field.  \n- **Background**: Curtains – **subtle blur** (Gaussian blur: 1–2 pixels) and **muted colors** to avoid competing with the foreground.  \n- **Lighting**: Vignetting (top layer) – radial gradient to darken edges.  \n\n#### **Shapes**\n- **Man’s Jacket**: Use a **rectangle** for the body, with **rounded corners** at the bottom. Add **lapels** as two triangular shapes on the collar.  \n- **Woman’s Dress**: Use a **rectangle** for the bodice, with **curved sides** to mimic a fitted silhouette. Add **short sleeves** as semi-circular shapes attached to the shoulders.  \n- **Curtains**: Use **rectangles** for the main panels, with **vertical lines** (1–2 pixels wide) to represent folds. Add a **slight curve** to the left curtain for a draped effect.  \n- **Flutes**: Use **rectangles** (stems), **ovals** (bowls), and **circles** (bases). Add a **linear gradient** to the bowl (light in the center, dark at the edges) to mimic glass.  \n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Man’s Suit**: Use a **subtle linear gradient** (light at the top, dark at the bottom) to add depth.  \n- **Woman’s Dress**: Use a **pattern fill** (small flowers) with **low opacity** (20–30%) to keep the fabric looking translucent.  \n- **Curtains**: Use a **stripe pattern** (vertical lines) with **varying opacity** (80–100%) to mimic a woven texture.  \n\n#### **Color**\n- **Warm Tint**: Apply a **global color filter** (e.g., multiply blend mode with #FFE4B5 at 10% opacity) to unify the palette and enhance the vintage feel.  \n- **Shadows**: Add **soft drop shadows** (1–2 pixels, #000000 at 10% opacity) to the couple’s hands and flutes to create depth.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical SVG Requirements**\nTo ensure accuracy, prioritize:  \n1. **Period-specific attire**: Man’s high-collared shirt, bow tie, and waistcoat; woman’s chiffon dress and Art Deco watch.  \n2. **Spatial precision**: Couple’s positioning, hand gestures, and flute angles.  \n3. **Texture and color**: Translucent chiffon, woven curtains, and warm cinematic lighting.  \n4. **Depth of field**: Blur and opacity adjustments for background elements.  \n5. **Small details**: Boutonniere, headpiece, jewelry, and vignetting.  \n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, the SVG will capture the image’s romantic, vintage atmosphere and geometric accuracy.",
  "v1_148": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a comprehensive breakdown of all elements, including geometric details, proportions, colors, and spatial relationships. The design combines a **meme-style text overlay** with a **raster image of a Kermit the Frog plush toy** on a couch, optimized for vector (text/watermark) and raster (photograph) integration.\n\n\n### **1.

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified using **hex codes** for precision. Textures are described for both vector (smooth) and raster (tactile) elements.\n\n| Element                | Color (Hex Code)       | Texture/Visual Property                  |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| **Main Text**          | `#000000` (Black)      | Smooth, bold sans-serif (vector).        |\n| **Kermit’s Body**      | `#66BB6A` (Light Green) | Fuzzy, plush texture (raster).           |\n| **Kermit’s Eyes**      | `#FFFFFF` (White)      | Glossy, with black pupils (`#000000`).   |\n| **Kermit’s Mouth**     | `#EF5350` (Red)        | Soft, fabric texture (interior); pink tongue (`#FF8A80`) visible. |\n| **Couch Backrest**     | `#F0ECEB` (Light Pinkish-White) | Padded, with subtle vertical stripes (`#F8F4F3`). |\n| **Couch Seat**         | `#F5F0EF` (Light Grayish-White) | Quilted pattern with soft shadows (`#E8E0DF`). |\n| **Watermark**          | `#999999` (Gray)       | Thin, sans-serif (vector).               |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe SVG uses a **viewBox** of `0 0 1000 1500` (1000px wide × 1500px tall) to maintain consistent proportions. Elements are positioned relative to this viewBox:\n\n#### **Top Text Section (Height: 500px)**  \n- **Line 1**: `\"Me: I’ll do it at 8\"`  \n  - Position: `x=\"50\" y=\"100\"` (50px from left, 100px from top).  \n  - Size: `font-size=\"60px\"`, `font-family=\"Arial\"`, `font-weight=\"bold\"`.  \n- **Line 2**: `\"Time: 8.05\"`  \n  - Position: `x=\"50\" y=\"200\"` (100px below Line 1).  \n  - Size: Identical to Line 1.  \n- **Line 3**: `\"Me: looks like I gotta wait till 9 now\"`  \n  - Position: `x=\"50\" y=\"300\"` (100px below Line 2).  \n  - Size: Identical to Line 1.  \n\n#### **Bottom Image Section (Height: 1000px)**  \n- **Embedded Photograph**: Covers the entire bottom section (Kermit + couch).  \n  - Position: `x=\"0\" y=\"500\"` (aligns with the bottom of the text section).  \n  - Size: `width=\"1000px\" height=\"1000px\"` (fills the viewBox’s width/height).  \n  - **Kermit’s Placement**: Centered horizontally within the image (x=500px, y=1000px, roughly).  \n\n#### **Watermark**  \n- Text: `\"boredpanda.com\"`  \n  - Position: `x=\"750\" y=\"1450\"` (250px from left, 50px from bottom).  \n  - Size: `font-size=\"30px\"`, `font-family=\"Arial\"`.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Meme Aesthetic**: Combines bold, readable text with a humorous, relatable image (Kermit’s \"defeated\" pose).  \n- **Text Style**: Modern, sans-serif (`Arial Bold`) for clarity; left-aligned to mimic casual speech.  \n- **Image Style**: Realistic photograph of a plush toy, with soft lighting and a neutral couch background to keep focus on Kermit.  \n- **Texture Contrast**: Smooth vector text vs. tactile raster image (Kermit’s fuzz, couch’s padding).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \n- **Main Text**: Exact phrases as shown (`\"Me: I’ll do it at 8\"`, `\"Time: 8.05\"`, `\"Me: looks like I gotta wait till 9 now\"`).  \n- **Font**: `Arial` (sans-serif), `bold`, `60px` (main text); `30px` (watermark).  \n- **Alignment**: Left-aligned (main text); right-aligned (watermark, implicit via `x=\"750\"`).  \n\n#### **Symbols/Logos**  \n- **Watermark**: `\"boredpanda.com\"` (credit to the source).  \n\n#### **Specific Details**  \n- **Kermit’s Pose**: Sitting upright on the couch, arms behind head (elbows raised), legs slightly apart. Feet have frayed, \"torn\" edges (classic Kermit design).  \n- **Couch**: Backrest with vertical stripes; seat with a quilted pattern (small rectangular pads with subtle shadows).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light on Kermit and the couch, creating gentle highlights on the plush toy’s surface.  \n\n\n### **SVG Structure Overview**\nThe SVG combines vector text with an embedded raster image. Below is a simplified template (replace `kermit_couch.jpg` with the actual image path):\n\n```svg\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 1500\">\n  <!-- Bottom Image (Kermit on Couch) -->\n  <image x=\"0\" y=\"500\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" xlink:href=\"kermit_couch.jpg\" />\n  \n  <!-- Top Text (3 Lines) -->\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"100\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-size=\"60\" fill=\"#000000\">Me: I’ll do it at 8</text>\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"200\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-size=\"60\" fill=\"#000000\">Time: 8.05</text>\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"300\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-size=\"60\" fill=\"#000000\">Me: looks like I gotta wait till 9 now</text>\n  \n  <!-- Watermark -->\n  <text x=\"750\" y=\"1450\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"30\" fill=\"#999999\">boredpanda.com</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Critical Notes for Recreation**\n- **Image Embedding**: The Kermit/couch photograph must be a high-resolution JPG/PNG and referenced in the `xlink:href` attribute.  \n- **Font Availability**: Use `Arial` (or a similar sans-serif) to match the original style.  \n- **ViewBox Consistency**: Keep the `viewBox=\"0 0 1000 1500\"` to maintain proportions when scaling.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as an SVG, balancing vector text (for scalability) with a raster image (for realistic texture).",
  "v1_149": "To accurately recreate this satirical image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its elements, layout, and visual properties. The image uses a 2x2 grid of panels under a main title, with a satirical tone contrasting corporate profit, teacher ease, and student chaos.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **2x2 grid of panels** (4 total) with a centered main title at the top. Each panel has a label and distinct content:  \n- **Top Left Panel (\"Zoom\")**: A standing man in a black suit/white shirt with arms raised, surrounded by falling dollar bills.  \n- **Top Right Panel (\"Teacher\")**: A reclined man in a gray-striped shirt, relaxed with arms behind his head, in a bright room.  \n- **Bottom Left Panel (\"Wifi company\")**: A standing man in a black suit/blue tie/white shirt with arms raised, surrounded by falling dollar bills against a mountain landscape.  \n- **Bottom Right Panel (\"Students\")**: A Joker-like character in a red suit/yellow vest, with \"PUT ON A HAPPY FACE\" handwritten on the wall behind him.  \n\n#### Key Shapes:\n- **Dollar Bills**: Rectangles (varying sizes: 20x10px to 40x20px) with \"100\" text, rotated at random angles (0–360°).  \n- **Humans**: Simplified vector figures (circular heads, rectangular bodies, curved limbs) with clothing details (stripes, ties, suits).  \n- **Background Elements**:  \n  - **Zoom/Wifi Company**: White (Zoom) or mountain/sky (Wifi) backdrops.  \n  - **Teacher**: Window (rectangle with light blue fill) and optional desk (rectangle with brown fill).  \n  - **Students**: Wall (rectangle with light gray fill), lamp (rectangle with yellow shade/brown base), and plant (curved green leaves/brown stem).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **flat vector fills** (no gradients) for SVG compatibility. Below are hex codes and texture notes:  \n\n| Element | Color (Hex) | Texture/Notes |\n|---------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Main Title/Labels** | #000000 (Black) | Clean sans-serif font (e.g., Arial), bold (title) or regular (labels). |\n| **Zoom Man** | Suit: #000000; Shirt: #FFFFFF | Smooth, solid fills. |\n| **Dollar Bills** | Bill: #228B22 (Green); Text: #000000 | Flat green with black \"100\" text (font: Arial, 8px). |\n| **Teacher** | Shirt: #808080 (Gray) + #FFFFFF (White) stripes; Background: #ADD8E6 (Light Blue) | Horizontal stripes (10px tall) for the shirt; bright, airy room. |\n| **Wifi Company Man** | Suit: #000000; Tie: #0000FF; Shirt: #FFFFFF | Solid fills; tie is a narrow rectangle (10px wide) hanging from the collar. |\n| **Wifi Background** | Sky: #87CEEB (Light Blue); Mountains: #FFFFFF | Sky is a top-to-bottom rectangle; mountains are irregular polygons (white) at the bottom. |\n| **Students Character** | Suit: #FF0000 (Red); Vest: #FFFF00 (Yellow); Shirt: #800080 (Purple); Face: #FFFFFF; Lips: #FF0000; Hair: #00FF00 | Solid fills; hair is spiky paths (5–7 points) on the head. |\n| **Students Wall Text** | #FFC0CB (Pink) | Handwritten (irregular stroke width: 2–4px), uppercase. |\n| **Students Lamp** | Shade: #FFFF00; Base: #8B4513 (Brown) | Shade is a rounded rectangle; base is a narrow rectangle. |\n| **BCCL Watermark** | #000000 | Small sans-serif text (12px) at the bottom-right of the students’ panel. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses a **grid-based layout** with consistent margins and spacing. For a 1000px × 1000px canvas (standard for SVG), measurements are:  \n\n#### Overall Structure:\n- **Main Title**: \"Studying online\" (font size: 80px) centered at the top (y=20px).  \n- **Grid**: 850px tall (85% of canvas) and 1000px wide, positioned below the title (y=150px).  \n- **Panels**: 4 equal-sized panels (475px × 400px) with 50px spacing between them (horizontal/vertical).  \n\n#### Panel Positions (x, y, width, height):\n| Panel | Position (x, y) | Size |\n|-------|-----------------|------|\n| Top Left (\"Zoom\") | (25, 175) | 475×400 |\n| Top Right (\"Teacher\") | (525, 175) | 475×400 |\n| Bottom Left (\"Wifi company\") | (25, 600) | 475×400 |\n| Bottom Right (\"Students\") | (525, 600) | 475×400 |\n\n#### Label Positions:\nEach label (\"Zoom\", \"Teacher\", \"Wifi company\", \"Students\") is **font size 40px**, centered above its panel:  \n- \"Zoom\": (250, 140)  \n- \"Teacher\": (750, 140)  \n- \"Wifi company\": (250, 570)  \n- \"Students\": (750, 570)  \n\n#### Element Placement Within Panels:\n- **Zoom/Wifi Company Men**: Centered (x=250, y=375 for top left panel), taking 60% of the panel height (240px). Arms are raised (curved paths from shoulders to above the head).  \n- **Dollar Bills**: 100–150 bills per panel, randomly positioned (more concentrated around the man). Layered: some behind the man, some in front.  \n- **Teacher**: Reclined on the left third of the panel (x=100, y=300), with the bright room background on the right.  \n- **Students Character**: Centered (x=750, y=800), taking 70% of the panel height (280px). \"PUT ON A HAPPY FACE\" is positioned behind the character (x=650, y=700), with the lamp to the left (x=550, y=750) and plant to the right (x=850, y=750).  \n- **BCCL Watermark**: Small text (12px) at the bottom-right of the students’ panel (x=950, y=980).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **satirical collage** with a mix of realistic (e.g., dollar bills, clothing) and stylized (e.g., Joker character) elements. Key style notes:  \n- **Tone**: Contrast between corporate greed (Zoom/Wifi panels, filled with money) and student chaos (Joker character), with the teacher as a relaxed旁观者.  \n- **Vector Style**: Flat colors, minimal shading, and simplified shapes (e.g., the man’s head is a circle with basic facial features: eyes as dots, mouth as a curve).  \n- **Textures**:  \n  - **Stripes**: Horizontal gray/white stripes for the teacher’s shirt (10px tall).  \n  - **Handwritten Text**: \"PUT ON A HAPPY FACE\" uses an irregular path with a 4px stroke (pink) and no fill, mimicking marker writing.  \n  - **Dollar Bills**: Uniform green fill with small black text, giving a \"cartoon money\" look.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Main Title**: \"Studying online\" – Bold, sans-serif (e.g., Arial), 80px, centered at the top.  \n- **Panel Labels**: \"Zoom\", \"Teacher\", \"Wifi company\", \"Students\" – Regular sans-serif, 40px, centered above each panel.  \n- **Wall Text (Students Panel)**: \"PUT ON A HAPPY FACE\" – Handwritten, uppercase, pink (#FFC0CB), 30px, positioned behind the character. The text has irregular stroke widths (2–4px) to mimic human handwriting.  \n- **BCCL Watermark**: Small sans-serif text (12px, black) at the bottom-right of the students’ panel (x=950, y=980).  \n- **Dollar Bills**: Each bill has \"100\" text (8px, black) centered on the green rectangle. The bills are rotated at random angles (0–360°) to create a \"falling\" effect.  \n- **Joker Character**: Key details:  \n  - **Face**: White fill (#FFFFFF) with red lips (curved path, #FF0000) and green hair (spiky paths, #00FF00).  \n  - **Clothing**: Red suit (#FF0000) with a yellow vest (#FFFF00) and purple shirt (#800080) visible at the collar.  \n- **Teacher’s Shirt**: Horizontal gray (#808080) and white (#FFFFFF) stripes, 10px tall, covering the entire shirt.  \n\n\n### **Critical Notes for SVG Recreation**\n- **Layer Order**: Ensure the man/character is on top of background elements (e.g., dollar bills, wall text) but below foreground elements (e.g., some dollar bills in the Zoom panel).  \n- **Randomness**: For dollar bills, use a script or manual placement to vary size (20x10px to 40x20px) and rotation (0–360°) for a natural \"falling\" look.  \n- **Handwritten Text**: Use a vector path tool (e.g., Illustrator’s Pen Tool) to draw \"PUT ON A HAPPY FACE\" with irregular curves and stroke widths. Avoid using a font—this must be a custom path.  \n- **Facial Features**: Keep them simple: eyes as small black dots, mouth as a curved line (smiling for the man, Joker’s smile as a wide curve).  \n- **Responsiveness**: For SVG, use relative units (e.g., percentages) instead of fixed pixels if the image needs to scale, but fixed pixels are acceptable for a static 1000px × 1000px canvas.  \n\n\nThis description provides all the geometric, color, and layout details needed to accurately recreate the image as an SVG. The key is to maintain the satirical contrast between the panels while using flat vector shapes for scalability and compatibility.",

Hex colors are specified for accuracy:  \n| Element               | Color       | Description                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Holder Frame          | `#e5e5e5`   | Light gray, matte plastic.                   |\n| Recessed Compartment  | `#d4d4d4`   | Darker gray (inset effect), matte.           |\n| Left Tab              | `#000000`   | Smooth, shiny black (toggle/release tab).    |\n| Card                  | `#ffffff`   | Bright white paper (high contrast for text). |\n| Discount Box          | `#000000`   | Solid black (draws attention to sale).       |\n| Text (Product/Price)  | `#000000`   | Bold black sans-serif (high readability).    |\n| Text (Discount)       | `#ffffff`   | Bold white sans-serif (contrasts with black box). |\n| Arrow                 | `#ffffff`   | Simple downward-pointing triangle (white).   |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **grid-aligned** for clarity, with margins to avoid crowding. A **`viewBox=\"0 0 1000 500\"`** is used for responsive scaling (all coordinates are relative to this 1000x500 canvas).  \n\n#### **Holder & Recess**\n- **Holder**: Outermost rectangle (`x=0`, `y=0`, `width=1000`, `height=500`), rounded corners (`rx=15`, `ry=15`).  \n- **Recess**: Inset by `40px` on all sides (`x=40`, `y=40`, `width=920`, `height=420`), darker gray (`#d4d4d4`), rounded corners (`rx=10`, `ry=10`).  \n- **Left Tab**: Small rectangle on the holder’s left frame (`x=20`, `y=60`, `width=25`, `height=70`), black (`#000000`), rounded corners (`rx=3`, `ry=3`).  \n\n#### **Card**\nFits perfectly in the recess, inset by `10px` on all sides for a margin:  \n- `x=50`, `y=50`, `width=900`, `height=400`, white (`#ffffff`), rounded corners (`rx=5`, `ry=5`).  \n\n#### **Card Layout**\nThe card is divided into two sections by a horizontal line:  \n- **Top Section** (Product & Shelf Life): Occupies the top 25% of the card (`y=50` to `y=150`).  \n- **Bottom Section** (Discount & Price): Occupies the bottom 75% of the card (`y=160` to `y=450`), separated by a thin black line.  \n\n| Section       | Elements                                  | Positioning                                  |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Top**       | \"PORK BELLY\" (left), \"Shelf Life September 1\" (right) | Separated by a horizontal line (`y=160`).   |\n| **Bottom**    | 30% discount box (left), price (right)    | Discount box takes 35% of the width; price takes 65%. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning (Continued)**\n#### **Top Section Text**\n- **\"PORK BELLY\"**: Uppercase, bold sans-serif.  \n  - Position: Left-aligned, 10px from the card’s left edge (`x=60`).  \n  - Vertical Alignment: Centered in the top section (`y=100`), using `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"`.  \n  - Font Size: `70px` (second-largest text).  \n\n- **\"Shelf Life September 1\"**: Title case, regular sans-serif.  \n  - Position: Right-aligned, 10px from the card’s right edge (`x=890`).  \n  - Vertical Alignment: Centered with \"PORK BELLY\" (`y=100`).  \n  - Font Size: `30px` (smallest text).  \n\n#### **Horizontal Divider**\nA thin black line separates the top and bottom sections:  \n- `x1=60`, `y1=160`, `x2=890`, `y2=160`, `stroke=\"#000000\"`, `stroke-width=2`.  \n\n#### **Bottom Section: Discount Box**\nA solid black rectangle (`#000000`) with white text and an arrow:  \n- Position: Left-aligned, 10px from the card’s left edge and 10px below the divider (`x=60`, `y=170`).  \n- Size: `width=320`, `height=270` (35% of card width, 90% of bottom section height).  \n- Rounded Corners: `rx=3`, `ry=3`.  \n\n  - **\"30%\"**: Uppercase, bold sans-serif, white (`#ffffff`).  \n    - Position: Left of center (20% from the box’s left edge: `x=120`).  \n    - Vertical Alignment: Centered (`y=305`).  \n    - Font Size: `110px` (third-largest text).  \n\n  - **Downward Arrow**: A simple triangle (points down) to indicate a price reduction.  \n    - Path: `d=\"M 280 250 L 305 300 L 255 300 Z\"` (base: 50px, height: 50px).  \n    - Position: Right of \"30%\" (70% from the box’s left edge: `x=280`).  \n    - Vertical Alignment: Centered (`y=305`).  \n    - Fill: `#ffffff`.  \n\n#### **Bottom Section: Price**\n- **\"9.80\"**: Bold sans-serif, black (`#000000`).  \n  - Position: Right-aligned, 10px from the card’s right edge (`x=890`).  \n  - Vertical Alignment: Centered with the discount box (`y=305`).  \n  - Font Size: `170px` (**largest text**, for quick scanning).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe design is **utilitarian and minimalistic**, optimized for grocery store environments:  \n- **Readability**: Bold fonts for key information (price, discount, product name); regular fonts for secondary details (shelf life).  \n- **Contrast**: High contrast between black (discount box) and white (text/arrow) draws attention to sales.  \n- **Texture**: Matte finishes for the holder/recess; smooth white card for print clarity.  \n- **Rounded Corners**: Softens the plastic holder’s edges (common in retail fixtures).  \n- **Hierarchy**: Information is prioritized by font size:  \n  - **1st**: Price (`170px`).  \n  - **2nd**: Discount (`110px`).  \n  - **3rd**: Product Name (`70px`).  \n  - **4th**: Shelf Life (`30px`).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n| Element               | Text/Symbol | Style                  | Color       | Positioning                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Product Name          | \"PORK BELLY\" | Uppercase, bold sans-serif | `#000000`   | Left-aligned, top section.                   |\n| Shelf Life            | \"Shelf Life September 1\" | Title case, regular sans-serif | `#000000`   | Right-aligned, top section.                  |\n| Discount              | \"30%\"       | Uppercase, bold sans-serif | `#ffffff`   | Inside black box, left of center.            |\n| Discount Indicator    | ↓ (triangle) | Simple downward arrow  | `#ffffff`   | Inside black box, right of \"30%\".            |\n| Price                 | \"9.80\"      | Bold sans-serif        | `#000000`   | Right-aligned, bottom section (largest text). |\n\n\n### **SVG Implementation Notes**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following **viewBox** and elements:  \n- **ViewBox**: `viewBox=\"0 0 1000 500\"` (responsive scaling).  \n- **Fonts**: Use generic sans-serif (e.g., `Arial Black`, `Arial`) for consistency.  \n- **Rounded Corners**: Apply `rx`/`ry` to the holder, recess, card, and discount box.  \n- **Margins**: Add 10px margins to all elements to avoid crowding.  \n\n#### **Sample SVG Code Snippet**\n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 1000 500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Holder Frame -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"15\" fill=\"#e5e5e5\" />\n  \n  <!-- Recessed Compartment -->\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"40\" width=\"920\" height=\"420\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#d4d4d4\" />\n  \n  <!-- Left Tab -->\n  <rect x=\"20\" y=\"60\" width=\"25\" height=\"70\" rx=\"3\" ry=\"3\" fill=\"#000000\" />\n  \n  <!-- White Card -->\n  <rect x=\"50\" y=\"50\" width=\"900\" height=\"400\" rx=\"5\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ffffff\" />\n  \n  <!-- Top Section Text -->\n  <text x=\"60\" y=\"100\" font-family=\"Arial Black, sans-serif\" font-size=\"70\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">PORK BELLY</text>\n  <text x=\"890\" y=\"100\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"30\" fill=\"#000000\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\" text-anchor=\"end\">Shelf Life September 1</text>\n  \n  <!-- Horizontal Divider -->\n  <line x1=\"60\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"890\" y2=\"160\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\" />\n  \n  <!-- Discount Box -->\n  <rect x=\"60\" y=\"170\" width=\"320\" height=\"270\" rx=\"3\" ry=\"3\" fill=\"#000000\" />\n  <text x=\"120\" y=\"305\" font-family=\"Arial Black, sans-serif\" font-size=\"110\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#ffffff\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">30%</text>\n  <path d=\"M 280 250 L 305 300 L 255 300 Z\" fill=\"#ffffff\" />\n  \n  <!-- Price -->\n  <text x=\"890\" y=\"305\" font-family=\"Arial Black, sans-serif\" font-size=\"170\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\" text-anchor=\"end\">9.80</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Key Accuracy Checks**\n- **Spatial Alignment**: All elements are positioned with consistent margins (10px) to avoid overlap.  \n- **Font Proportions**: Price > Discount > Product Name > Shelf Life (critical for readability).  \n- **Contrast**: Black/white combinations for discounts and prices ensure visibility.  \n- **Rounded Corners**: Subtle rounding on the holder, recess, and card matches real-world plastic fixtures.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG.",
  "v1_150": "To accurately recreate this meme-style image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its components, layout, and visual properties. The image is a vertical composition of **three stacked horizontal panels** with contrasting landscapes and text, designed to highlight the humorous mismatch between the names \"Iceland\" and \"Greenland.\"\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is divided into **three vertical sections** (panels) stacked top-to-bottom. Each panel contains text and/or a landscape:  \n- **Top Panel**: A plain header with explanatory text.  \n- **Middle Panel**: A lush green valley labeled \"Iceland.\"  \n- **Bottom Panel**: A snowy plateau labeled \"Greenland.\"  \n\n#### **Top Panel (Header)**  \n- **Shape**: A rectangular bar occupying the top 20% of the image height.  \n- **Content**: Centered text: *\"This is why I have trust issues\"*.  \n\n#### **Middle Panel (\"Iceland\")**  \n- **Shape**: A rectangular panel occupying the middle 40% of the image height.  \n- **Content**:  \n  - **Background Sky**: A wide horizontal band at the top of the panel.  \n  - **Mountains**: Two triangular mountain ranges (left and right) with snow-capped peaks.  \n  - **Valley**: A central, bowl-shaped green valley between the mountains.  \n  - **River**: A winding stream cutting through the valley.  \n  - **Label**: Centered text at the bottom: *\"Iceland\"*.  \n\n#### **Bottom Panel (\"Greenland\")**  \n- **Shape**: A rectangular panel occupying the bottom 40% of the image height.  \n- **Content**:  \n  - **Background Sky**: A narrow horizontal band at the top of the panel.  \n  - **Snow Plateau**: A large, flat snowy area covering most of the panel.  \n  - **Ice Crevices**: Thin, irregular cracks in the snow.  \n  - **Hiker**: A small human figure standing on the snow.  \n  - **Label**: Centered text at the bottom: *\"Greenland\"*.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe color palette is intentional, contrasting the \"misleading\" names of Iceland (green) and Greenland (snowy/blue). Textures are subtle, using gradients and filters to add depth.\n\n#### **Top Panel**  \n- **Background**: Light gray (#f0f0f0) with a **subtle noise texture** (created via an SVG `<filter>`) to mimic worn paper.  \n- **Text**: Black (#000000), serif font (e.g., Times New Roman), medium weight.  \n\n#### **Middle Panel (\"Iceland\")**  \n- **Sky**: Dark gray gradient (#4a5a6a at the top, #7a8a9a at the bottom) to evoke a stormy, overcast atmosphere.  \n- **Mountains**: Linear gradient from dark green (#2e4e3a) at the peaks to medium green (#6b9e4a) at the base. Snow caps: Pale gray (#f0f0f0).  \n- **Valley**: Bright green gradient (#8bc34a at the center, #6b9e4a at the edges) to emphasize depth.  \n- **River**: Light gray-blue (#a0b8c3), thin stroke (1px equivalent).  \n- **Label**: White (#ffffff), serif font, same as top text but slightly larger.  \n\n#### **Bottom Panel (\"Greenland\")**  \n- **Sky**: Light blue-gray gradient (#d0d8e0 at the top, #a0bfe0 at the bottom) for a softer, clearer atmosphere.  \n- **Snow Plateau**: Pure white (#ffffff) with a **subtle texture filter** (fractal noise) to mimic snow grain.  \n- **Ice Crevices**: Pale blue (#b3d1e1), thin strokes (0.2px equivalent) with rounded caps.  \n- **Hiker**: Red (#ff0000) body/head, black (#000000) stick. Simple geometric shapes (circle for head, rectangle for body, line for stick).  \n- **Label**: White (#ffffff), serif font, same as middle panel.  \n\n#### **Textures**  \n- **Top Panel Noise**: Use an SVG `<filter>` with `feTurbulence` (baseFrequency=0.02, numOctaves=2) to add a faint, grainy texture.  \n- **Snow Texture**: Use a `<filter>` with `feTurbulence` (baseFrequency=0.03, numOctaves=2) and `feDisplacementMap` (scale=1) to give the snow a slightly rough, natural look.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses a **vertical stack layout** with consistent horizontal centering. Proportions are defined relative to a **viewbox of 0 0 100 150** (width: 100 units, height: 150 units) to ensure scalability.\n\n| Panel          | Height (Viewbox Units) | Y-Range | Content Positioning                                                                 |\n|----------------|------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Top (Header)   | 20% (30 units)         | 0–30    | Text centered horizontally (x=50) and vertically (y=15).                            |\n| Middle (Iceland) | 40% (60 units)         | 30–90   | Sky (30–60), mountains (30–60), valley (60–90), river (60–90). Label at bottom (y=85). |\n| Bottom (Greenland) | 40% (60 units)         | 90–150  | Sky (90–100), snow (100–150), crevices (100–150). Hiker at (75, 95). Label at bottom (y=145). |\n\n#### **Key Spatial Details**  \n- **Mountains (Iceland)**: Left mountain (points: 0,60; 20,30; 40,60) and right mountain (points: 60,60; 80,30; 100,60) form a \"V\" shape converging at the valley.  \n- **River (Iceland)**: Curved path from the valley’s center (50,60) to the bottom (50,90) using a cubic bezier (d=\"M50 60 C45 70 55 80 50 90\").  \n- **Hiker (Greenland)**: Positioned at (75, 95) (right third of the panel, near the top of the snow) to balance the composition.  \n- **Text Centering**: All text uses `text-anchor=\"middle\"` for horizontal centering. Top text is vertically centered; labels are 5% from the bottom of their panels.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Meme Format**: The vertical stack of panels is a classic meme layout, using contrasting visuals to highlight the joke (Iceland is green, Greenland is snowy).  \n- **Realistic Simplification**: Landscapes are simplified (e.g., triangular mountains, curved river) but use gradients to create depth.  \n- **Color Contrast**: Iceland’s warm greens vs. Greenland’s cool whites/blues emphasize the name mismatch.  \n- **Text Style**: Serif font adds a \"formal\" touch, contrasting with the humorous content.  \n- **Balance**: The hiker in Greenland and river in Iceland add visual interest and prevent empty space.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Top Text**: *\"This is why I have trust issues\"* – Central to the joke, explaining the frustration with misleading names.  \n- **Labels**: *\"Iceland\"* (middle) and *\"Greenland\"* (bottom) – Key to the contrast; positioned at the bottom of their panels for clarity.  \n- **Hiker (Greenland)**: A small, red figure with a stick – Adds scale (shows the snow’s vastness) and context (human presence in a harsh environment).  \n- **River (Iceland)**: Thin, winding stream – Adds movement to the static valley and guides the eye to the center.  \n\n\n### **SVG-Specific Geometric Details**\nTo ensure accurate reproduction, use the following SVG elements and attributes:\n\n#### **Viewbox**  \nSet a **viewbox of 0 0 100 150** to maintain proportional scaling. All coordinates are relative to this viewbox.\n\n#### **Top Panel**  \n```svg\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#f0f0f0\" filter=\"url(#noiseFilter)\"/>\n<text x=\"50\" y=\"15\" font-family=\"Times New Roman\" font-size=\"3\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">This is why I have trust issues</text>\n```\n\n#### **Middle Panel (\"Iceland\")**  \n```svg\n<!-- Sky -->\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"30\" width=\"100\" height=\"60\" fill=\"url(#icelandSkyGradient)\"/>\n\n<!-- Left Mountain -->\n<polygon points=\"0,60 20,30 40,60\" fill=\"url(#icelandMountainGradient)\"/>\n<!-- Right Mountain -->\n<polygon points=\"60,60 80,30 100,60\" fill=\"url(#icelandMountainGradient)\"/>\n\n<!-- Valley -->\n<polygon points=\"40,60 50,90 60,60\" fill=\"url(#icelandValleyGradient)\"/>\n\n<!-- River -->\n<path d=\"M50 60 C45 70 55 80 50 90\" stroke=\"#a0b8c3\" stroke-width=\"0.5\" fill=\"none\"/>\n\n<!-- Label -->\n<text x=\"50\" y=\"85\" font-family=\"Times New Roman\" font-size=\"4\" fill=\"#ffffff\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Iceland</text>\n```\n\n#### **Bottom Panel (\"Greenland\")**  \n```svg\n<!-- Sky -->\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"90\" width=\"100\" height=\"10\" fill=\"url(#greenlandSkyGradient)\"/>\n\n<!-- Snow Plateau -->\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"100\" height=\"50\" fill=\"#ffffff\" filter=\"url(#snowTextureFilter)\"/>\n\n<!-- Ice Crevices (example) -->\n<path d=\"M20 110 L25 115\" stroke=\"#b3d1e1\" stroke-width=\"0.2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"/>\n<path d=\"M50 120 L55 125\" stroke=\"#b3d1e1\" stroke-width=\"0.2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"/>\n<path d=\"M80 130 L85 135\" stroke=\"#b3d1e1\" stroke-width=\"0.2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"/>\n\n<!-- Hiker -->\n<circle cx=\"75\" cy=\"95\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#ff0000\"/>\n<rect x=\"74.5\" y=\"96\" width=\"1\" height=\"2\" fill=\"#ff0000\"/>\n<line x1=\"75\" y1=\"97\" x2=\"77\" y2=\"99\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n\n<!-- Label -->\n<text x=\"50\" y=\"145\" font-family=\"Times New Roman\" font-size=\"4\" fill=\"#ffffff\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Greenland</text>\n```\n\n#### **Gradients**  \nDefine gradients in the `<defs>` section:  \n```svg\n<defs>\n  <!-- Top Panel Noise -->\n  <filter id=\"noiseFilter\">\n    <feTurbulence type=\"fractalNoise\" baseFrequency=\"0.02\" numOctaves=\"2\" result=\"noise\"/>\n    <feComposite in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\" operator=\"arithmetic\" k1=\"0\" k2=\"1\" k3=\"0\" k4=\"0\"/>\n  </filter>\n\n  <!-- Iceland Sky -->\n  <linearGradient id=\"icelandSkyGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#4a5a6a\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#7a8a9a\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n\n  <!-- Iceland Mountains -->\n  <linearGradient id=\"icelandMountainGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#2e4e3a\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#6b9e4a\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n\n  <!-- Iceland Valley -->\n  <linearGradient id=\"icelandValleyGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#6b9e4a\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#8bc34a\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n\n  <!-- Greenland Sky -->\n  <linearGradient id=\"greenlandSkyGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#d0d8e0\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#a0bfe0\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n\n  <!-- Snow Texture -->\n  <filter id=\"snowTextureFilter\">\n    <feTurbulence type=\"fractalNoise\" baseFrequency=\"0.03\" numOctaves=\"2\" result=\"noise\"/>\n    <feDisplacementMap in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\" scale=\"1\" xChannelSelector=\"R\" yChannelSelector=\"G\"/>\n  </filter>\n</defs>\n```\n\n\n### **Key Notes for SVG Recreation**\n- **Scalability**: Use the viewbox (0 0 100 150) to ensure all elements scale proportionally.  \n- **Filters**: Noise and texture filters are critical for realism—test `baseFrequency` and `scale` values to match the subtlety in the original.  \n- **Text**: Use a serif font (e.g., Times New Roman) and ensure `text-anchor=\"middle\"` for centering.  \n- **Paths**: The river and ice crevices use bezier curves (`C`) and lines (`L`) for natural shapes—adjust control points to match the original’s curvature.  \n\nThis detailed breakdown provides all the geometric, color, and layout information needed to accurately recreate the image as an SVG. The intentional contrast between Iceland’s green landscape and Greenland’s snowy terrain, combined with the explanatory text, is the core of the joke—ensure these elements are prioritized in the reproduction.",
  "v1_151": "To recreate this image accurately as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its **main elements, colors, spatial layout, style, and technical specifications**. The image is a humorous vertical composition comparing handwriting quality across exam pages, divided into three distinct sections with a top title.\n\n\n## **1. Overall Structure & Main Elements**\nThe image is a **vertical, rectangular composition** (assumed 16:9 ratio for generality, e.g., 1000px wide × 1500px tall) divided into:  \n- A **top title bar** (10% of total height).  \n- Three **horizontal sections** (30% of total height each) separated by **black header bars** (5% of each section’s height).  \n\nEach section includes:  \n- A **bold white text header** on a black background.  \n- A **content area** showing handwriting (first two sections) or an ECG trace (last section).  \n\n### **Top Title Bar**\n- **Text**: *\"My Handwriting In Exams\"*  \n- **Position**: Centered at the very top of the image.  \n- **Purpose**: Establishes the theme of the comparison.  \n\n### **Section 1: \"First two pages\"**\n- **Header**: Black rectangular bar with white text *\"First two pages\"*.  \n- **Content**: Neat, legible cursive handwriting on lined paper.  \n\n### **Section 2: \"Middle pages\"**\n- **Header**: Identical black bar with white text *\"Middle pages\"*.  \n- **Content**: Messy, slanted cursive handwriting on lined paper (worse legibility than Section 1).  \n\n### **Section 3: \"Last two pages\"**\n- **Header**: Identical black bar with white text *\"Last two pages\"*.  \n- **Content**: A realistic ECG (electrocardiogram) trace on graph paper (joke: \"unreadable\" handwriting).  \n\n\n## **2. Colors, Textures, & Visual Properties**\n### **Background**\n- Solid white (#ffffff) for the entire image.  \n\n### **Top Title**\n- **Text Color**: Black (#000000).  \n- **Font**: Bold sans-serif (e.g., *Arial Bold* or *Helvetica Bold*), large size (relative to headers).  \n- **Texture**: Smooth, clean (digital text).  \n\n### **Headers (All Sections)**\n- **Background**: Solid black (#000000) rectangular bar.  \n- **Text Color**: White (#ffffff).  \n- **Font**: Same bold sans-serif as the top title, but smaller (70% of the top title’s font size).  \n- **Texture**: Flat, high contrast (draws attention to section divisions).  \n\n### **Section 1: \"First two pages\" Content**\n- **Paper**: White background with **light gray horizontal lines** (#e0e0e0, 1px thick).  \n- **Handwriting**: Dark blue or black (#000000) cursive (e.g., *Lucida Calligraphy*), consistent stroke width (1.5px) with subtle thickening on downstrokes (authentic cursive).  \n- **Texture**: \"Hand-drawn\" with uniform letter sizing and spacing (legible).  \n\n### **Section 2: \"Middle pages\" Content**\n- **Paper**: Identical to Section 1 (white with light gray lines).  \n- **Handwriting**: Same color as Section 1, but **messier**: larger lettering (1.2× Section 1), more slant (30° vs. 15°), irregular stroke width (1–2px), and occasional letter overlap.  \n- **Texture**: \"Tired\" or \"rushed\"—less control, more chaos.  \n\n### **Section 3: \"Last two pages\" Content**\n- **Graph Paper**: White background with a **light gray grid** (#e0e0e0):  \n  - 1px lines spaced 10px apart (1mm scale).  \n  - 2px \"heavy\" lines every 50px (5mm intervals, standard for ECG paper).  \n- **ECG Trace**: Bold black (#000000) line (2px thick) with standard waves:  \n  - **P waves**: Small upward curves (10px amplitude, 20px width).  \n  - **QRS complexes**: Sharp \"spikes\" (10px downward, 30px upward, 20px downward).  \n  - **T waves**: Rounded upward curves (15px amplitude, 30px width).  \n- **Texture**: Clinical and technical—contrasts sharply with the handwriting sections.  \n\n\n## **3. Spatial Relationships & Positioning**\nUse **relative units** (e.g., percentages) for SVG scalability. Below is a breakdown for a 1000px wide × 1500px tall image (adjust ratios as needed):  \n\n| Element | Position (Top) | Height | Width | Alignment |\n|---------|----------------|--------|-------|-----------|\n| Top Title | 0px | 150px (10%) | 1000px | Centered |\n| Section 1 Header | 150px | 75px (5% of section height) | 1000px | Centered |\n| Section 1 Content | 225px | 450px (30% of total height) | 1000px | Left-aligned (handwriting) |\n| Section 2 Header | 675px | 75px | 1000px | Centered |\n| Section 2 Content | 750px | 450px | 1000px | Left-aligned |\n| Section 3 Header | 1200px | 75px | 1000px | Centered |\n| Section 3 Content | 1275px | 450px | 1000px | Full width (grid/trace) |\n\n### **Key Proportions**\n- **Paper Lines (Sections 1–2)**: Horizontal lines spaced 80px apart (8mm scale, visible as 3–4 lines per content area).  \n- **ECG Grid (Section 3)**: 10px × 10px squares (1mm), with heavy lines every 50px (5mm).  \n- **ECG Trace**:  \n  - **Rate**: 75 bpm (normal), so **R-R intervals** (time between QRS peaks) are 800ms (80px on 10px/ms scale).  \n  - **Amplitude**: P waves (10px), QRS (30px), T waves (15px) (matches 1mV/cm standard).  \n\n\n## **4. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Tone**: Humorous and relatable—compares exam handwriting degradation to an unreadable ECG.  \n- **Contrast**:  \n  - **Headers**: Bold black/white contrast draws attention to section divisions.  \n  - **Content**: Neat → messy → technical (ECG) creates a comedic \"decline\" narrative.  \n- **Handwriting Style**:  \n  - **Section 1**: Controlled cursive (e.g., *Lucida Calligraphy*) with consistent letterform and spacing.  \n  - **Section 2**: Same font but scaled up (1.2×), more slant (30°), and irregular stroke width (simulates \"rushed\" writing).  \n- **ECG Realism**: Follows standard medical guidelines (25mm/s speed, 1mV/cm amplitude) to make the joke credible.  \n\n\n## **5. Text, Symbols, & Specific Details**\n### **Top Title**\n- **Text**: *\"My Handwriting In Exams\"*  \n- **Font**: *Arial Bold*, 48px (for 1000px wide image), centered.  \n\n### **Section Headers**\n- **Text**: *\"First two pages\"*, *\"Middle pages\"*, *\"Last two pages\"*  \n- **Font**: *Arial Bold*, 36px, centered in black bars.  \n\n### **Handwriting Text**\n- **Section 1**: Legible cursive (truncated):  \n  *\"Global warming is definitely a very huge issue in front of this entire world. It's causing several disturbances in the...\"*  \n- **Section 2**: Messy cursive (truncated, less legible):  \n  *\"As we carry the mill stone of gloom and manifest ocean wake palleted and thus make the...\"*  \n- **Format**: Left-aligned, no margins, wraps naturally at the end of lines.  \n\n### **ECG Trace**\n- **Symbols**: Standard cardiac waves (P, QRS, T) repeated consistently.  \n- **Details**:  \n  - **P waves**: Precede each QRS complex (atrial depolarization).  \n  - **QRS complexes**: Sharp spikes (ventricular depolarization).  \n  - **T waves**: Follow QRS complexes (ventricular repolarization).  \n  - **Baseline**: Horizontal (no drift), with minor \"noise\" (1px variations) to simulate a real ECG.  \n\n### **Paper Lines**\n- **Section 1–2**: Light gray (#e0e0e0) horizontal lines (1px thick) spaced 80px apart.  \n- **Section 3**: Light gray grid (#e0e0e0) with 1px lines (10px spacing) and 2px heavy lines (50px spacing).  \n\n\n## **SVG Technical Notes**\n- **Handwriting**: Convert cursive text to **paths** (using a vector tool like Adobe Illustrator) to preserve stroke width variations.  \n- **Paper Lines**: Use a **pattern** for horizontal lines (Section 1–2) and grid (Section 3) to avoid repeating elements.  \n- **ECG Trace**: Draw as a single **path** with 2px stroke width, using bezier curves to replicate wave shapes.  \n- **Responsiveness**: Use `viewBox` (e.g., `viewBox=\"0 0 1000 1500\"`) to ensure scalability.  \n\n\n## **Summary for SVG Recreation**\nTo accurately reproduce the image, prioritize:  \n1. **Vertical stacking** of the top title and three sections.  \n2. **Consistent header design** (black bars, white text) for section separation.  \n3. **Handwriting variation** (neat → messy) to tell the comedic story.  \n4. **ECG realism** (standard grid, waves, and proportions) to make the joke credible.  \n5. **Scalable elements** (paths, patterns) for SVG compatibility.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will match the original image’s humor, structure, and visual hierarchy.",
  "v1_152": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, layer-by-layer description of its components, including geometric properties, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic choices. The image is a meme featuring characters from *SpongeBob SquarePants* with overlaid text.\n\n\n## **1. Overall Composition & Canvas**\nThe image is a rectangular meme with a **1:1.2 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1000px wide × 1200px tall). It is divided into two sections:  \n- **Top text bar** (15% of height): Contains dialogue labels.  \n- **Main visual area** (85% of height): A cartoon scene from *SpongeBob SquarePants*.  \n\n### **Coordinate System**  \nFor consistency, assume a **viewport** of `width=\"1000\" height=\"1200\"` with the origin `(0,0)` at the **top-left corner**. All positions and dimensions are relative to this.\n\n\n## **2. Top Text Bar (Layer 1: Foreground)**\nTwo left-aligned text lines in a **bold, sans-serif font** (e.g., Arial Bold) with black fill.  \n- **First line**: `\"Professor: \"Good morni...\"\"`  \n  - Position: `(20, 20)` (20px from top/left).  \n  - Font size: `40px`.  \n  - Quote marks: Straight (`\"`), not curly.  \n- **Second line**: `\"Freshmen:\"`  \n  - Position: `(20, 80)` (20px from left, 80px from top).  \n  - Font size: `40px` (matches first line).  \n\n\n## **3. Main Visual Area (Layers 2–6)**\nThe main scene is a night-time campfire setting with two central characters, a tent, and a stylized background. Layers are ordered from **background** to **foreground** (bottom to top in SVG).\n\n\n### **Layer 2: Background Sky & Sand**  \nThe lowest layer is a gradient background split into two horizontal bands:  \n- **Sky** (top 60% of main area): A dark blue (`#1a2a4a`) rectangle spanning `(0, 140)` to `(1000, 800)`.  \n  - **Stars**: 50–100 small white (`#ffffff`) circles (2px diameter) scattered randomly in the sky.  \n- **Sand** (bottom 40% of main area): A light blue (`#66ccff`) rectangle spanning `(0, 800)` to `(1000, 1200)`.  \n\n\n### **Layer 3: Background Tentacles (Decorative Elements)**  \nTwo large, glowing tentacle-shaped motifs in the left/center background, evoking Squidward’s house from the show.  \n- **Left tentacle**: Purple (`#800080`) with a light blue (`#00ffff`) inner glow.  \n  - Shape: A curved path with 5 rounded \"arms\" (each 100px long, 20px thick) radiating from a central point at `(150, 400)`.  \n- **Center tentacle**: Light blue (`#00ffff`) with a white (`#ffffff`) inner glow.  \n  - Shape: A larger curved path with 6 rounded arms (each 150px long, 25px thick) radiating from `(400, 450)`.  \n\n\n### **Layer 4: Tent (Right Background)**  \nA yellow canvas tent with a brown base, positioned on the **right third** of the main area.  \n- **Base**: Brown (`#8b4513`) rectangle spanning `(500, 700)` to `(1000, 800)` (100px tall).  \n- **Roof**: Yellow (`#ffff00`) trapezoid with a **curved top edge** (radius = 100px) spanning `(500, 300)` to `(1000, 700)` (400px tall).  \n  - **Stitching**: Thin black (`#000000`) diagonal lines (1px thick) at 45° angles, spaced 50px apart, covering the roof.  \n- **Window**: Circular porthole at the top of the roof:  \n  - Frame: Blue (`#0000ff`) circle (`cx=\"700\" cy=\"350\" r=\"30\"`).  \n  - Glass: White (`#ffffff`) circle (`cx=\"700\" cy=\"350\" r=\"25\"`).  \n\n\n### **Layer 5: Campfire (Foreground Left)**  \nA small campfire with a log and flickering flames, positioned **below SpongeBob** (left of center).  \n- **Log**: Brown (`#8b4513`) rectangle (`x=\"150\" y=\"920\" width=\"100\" height=\"20\"`) with a **curved top edge** (radius = 10px).  \n- **Flames**: Three overlapping orange (`#ff6600`) triangles with yellow (`#ffff00`) cores, centered at `(200, 850)`:  \n  - **Outer flames**: Three triangles (`base=\"60\" height=\"80\"`) at `(170, 820)`, `(200, 800)`, `(230, 820)`.  \n  - **Inner flames**: Three smaller triangles (`base=\"40\" height=\"60\"`) centered inside the outer flames, filled with yellow.  \n\n\n### **Layer 6: Characters (Foreground Center)**  \nTwo central characters: **SpongeBob SquarePants** (left) and **Patrick Star** (right). Both are stylized with bold outlines (2px black) and flat fills.  \n\n#### **SpongeBob SquarePants**  \n- **Base shape**: Yellow (`#ffff00`) square (`x=\"200\" y=\"600\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"`) with **6 circular holes** (diameter = 20px) evenly spaced on the body (e.g., `(250, 650)`, `(300, 700)`, etc.).  \n- **Eyes**: Two large white circles (`cx=\"250\" cy=\"650\" r=\"30\"`) with black pupils (`cx=\"260\" cy=\"660\" r=\"10\"`).  \n- **Mouth**: Wide open arc (`d=\"M220 720 Q250 750 280 720\"`) with two white rectangular teeth (`x=\"230\" y=\"720\" width=\"10\" height=\"15\"` and `x=\"270\" y=\"720\" width=\"10\" height=\"15\"`).  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - **Shirt**: White (`#ffffff`) rectangle (`x=\"220\" y=\"700\" width=\"160\" height=\"40\"`) with a collar (two small triangles at the top).  \n  - **Shorts**: Brown (`#8b4513`) rectangle (`x=\"220\" y=\"740\" width=\"160\" height=\"40\"`) with a black belt loop (`x=\"250\" y=\"740\" width=\"20\" height=\"5\"`).  \n  - **Tie**: Red (`#ff0000`) rectangle (`x=\"250\" y=\"700\" width=\"20\" height=\"60\"`).  \n- **Binoculars**: Held to his right eye (left side of the image):  \n  - **Lenses**: Two blue (`#0000ff`) circles (`cx=\"220\" cy=\"630\" r=\"30\"` and `cx=\"280\" cy=\"630\" r=\"30\"`).  \n  - **Body**: Black rectangle (`x=\"220\" y=\"600\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\"`) connecting the lenses.  \n\n#### **Patrick Star**  \n- **Base shape**: Pink (`#ff69b4`) five-pointed star (`x=\"600\" y=\"550\" points=\"700,500 750,600 800,700 700,750 600,700\"`) with a **rounded outline** (radius = 10px).  \n- **Eyes**: Two large white circles (`cx=\"680\" cy=\"600\" r=\"35\"`) with black pupils (`cx=\"690\" cy=\"610\" r=\"10\"`).  \n- **Eyebrows**: Two curved black lines (`d=\"M650 580 Q670 570 690 580\"` and `d=\"M710 580 Q730 570 750 580\"`).  \n- **Clothing**: Green (`#008000`) shorts (`x=\"620\" y=\"700\" width=\"160\" height=\"40\"`) with **purple flowers** (five-petaled, `#800080`, diameter = 20px) at `(650, 720)` and `(750, 720)`.  \n- **Notepad**: White (`#ffffff`) rectangle (`x=\"630\" y=\"650\" width=\"80\" height=\"60\"`) with a black border, held in his right hand.  \n- **Pencil**: Yellow (`#ffff00`) line (`x1=\"670\" y1=\"670\" x2=\"700\" y2=\"700\" stroke-width=\"5\"`) with a black tip (`x=\"700\" y=\"700\" r=\"3\"`).  \n\n\n## **4. Bottom Text (Layer 7: Foreground)**  \nA bold, white caption with a black outline, centered at the bottom of the main area.  \n- **Text**: `\"Write that down, write that down!\"`  \n- **Font**: Impact (bold, sans-serif).  \n- **Size**: `60px`.  \n- **Position**: `(500, 1000)` (centered horizontally, 100px from the bottom).  \n- **Style**: White fill (`#ffffff`) with a **2px black stroke** (`stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\"`).  \n\n\n## **5. Stylistic & Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Style**: Cartoony, exaggerated, and flat (no gradients except for subtle inner glows on tentacles).  \n- **Outlines**: All shapes (characters, tent, campfire) have a **2px black stroke** for definition.  \n- **Color Palette**: Vibrant, high-contrast (yellow SpongeBob, pink Patrick, blue sky, orange flames).  \n- **Proportions**: Characters are oversized relative to the tent (SpongeBob’s square body is 20% of the canvas width).  \n- **Negative Space**: The sky and sand areas are simple to keep focus on the characters and campfire.  \n\n\n## **6. Key SVG Implementation Notes**  \n- **Layers**: Organize elements into groups (`<g>`) for easy editing (e.g., `<g id=\"spongebob\">`, `<g id=\"tent\">`).  \n- **Shapes**: Use basic SVG primitives:  \n  - **Rectangles**: For SpongeBob’s body, Patrick’s shorts, tent base.  \n  - **Circles**: For eyes, binoculars, tent window, stars.  \n  - **Paths**: For tent roof (curved edge), SpongeBob’s mouth, tentacle motifs.  \n  - **Polygons**: For Patrick’s star shape, campfire flames.  \n- **Text**: Use `<text>` elements with specified `font-family`, `font-size`, and `fill`. The bottom text requires a `stroke` for the outline.  \n- **Glows**: For tentacles, use a `<filter>` (e.g., `feGaussianBlur`) to create a subtle inner glow.  \n\nExample SVG snippet for SpongeBob’s body:  \n```svg\n<g id=\"spongebob\">\n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"600\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" fill=\"#ffff00\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"250\" cy=\"650\" r=\"20\" fill=\"#1a2a4a\" stroke=\"none\"/> <!-- Body hole -->\n  <!-- Repeat for 5 more holes -->\n  <circle cx=\"250\" cy=\"650\" r=\"30\" fill=\"#ffffff\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\"/> <!-- Left eye -->\n  <!-- Add pupils, mouth, clothing, etc. -->\n</g>\n```\n\n\n## **7. Final Checks for Accuracy**  \n- **Spatial Relationships**: Ensure SpongeBob is left of Patrick, the tent is behind both characters, and the campfire is between them.  \n- **Text Alignment**: Top text is left-aligned; bottom text is centered.  \n- **Color Consistency**: Match hex values exactly (e.g., SpongeBob’s yellow = `#ffff00`, Patrick’s pink = `#ff69b4`).  \n- **Details**: Include all small elements (stitches on the tent, flowers on Patrick’s shorts, teeth in SpongeBob’s mouth).  \n\nBy following this description, the SVG will accurately replicate the original meme’s composition, style, and humor.",
  "v1_153": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this whimsical, cartoonish image, below is a detailed breakdown of its components, focusing on **geometric precision**, **color values**, **spatial relationships**, and **artistic style**. The description is structured to align with the requirements for SVG (scalable, vector-based) recreation, emphasizing editable shapes, layers, and repeatable patterns.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **friendly, anthropomorphic rhino** painting a savanna scene, surrounded by art supplies and smaller artworks. Key objects are listed below with their core geometric properties:\n\n#### **Central Character: Rhino**\n- **Body**: A large, rounded oval (approximate dimensions: 150px tall × 120px wide) with a slight downward taper at the bottom (for legs).\n- **Head**: A smaller oval (60px tall × 70px wide) attached to the top of the body, with a **long, pointed horn** (a curved triangle, 80px tall × 20px wide at the base) extending from the nose.\n- **Ears**: Two small, upright triangles (15px tall × 10px wide) on the top of the head, positioned symmetrically.\n- **Eyes**: Two large, circular whites (12px diameter) with black pupils (5px diameter), spaced 20px apart. Eyebrows are thin, curved lines above each eye, giving a curious expression.\n- **Mouth**: A wide, upward-curved arc (30px long) below the eyes, creating a smile.\n- **Legs**: Four short, thick rectangles (30px tall × 20px wide) attached to the bottom of the body, spaced evenly.\n- **Arms**: Two rounded rectangles (40px long × 15px wide) extending from the sides of the body:  \n  - **Right arm**: Holds a **paintbrush** (a thin rectangle, 30px long × 3px wide, with a 5px-wide white bristle tip).  \n  - **Left arm**: Holds a **paint palette** (a flat, irregular oval, 50px tall × 40px wide) with splotches of paint (see *Colors* below).\n\n#### **Easel and Main Painting**\n- **Easel**: A wooden frame composed of:  \n  - A vertical central pole (180px tall × 10px wide).  \n  - A horizontal top bar (100px long × 10px wide) attached to the top of the pole.  \n  - Two angled legs (120px long × 10px wide) extending from the bottom of the pole, forming a stable triangle.  \n- **Main Canvas**: A rectangle (120px tall × 100px wide) attached to the easel, displaying a **savanna scene**:  \n  - **Kopje (rock formation)**: A tall, pointed triangle (70px tall × 40px wide) in the center.  \n  - **Sky**: A gradient background (see *Colors*).  \n  - **Ground**: A green horizontal band at the bottom.  \n  - **Trees**: Two small, bushy triangles (15px tall × 10px wide) behind the kopje, with brown trunks (5px tall × 2px wide).\n\n#### **Smaller Paintings (Propped in Front of Easel)**\nTwo rectangular artworks (60px tall × 50px wide each) leaning against the easel, with naive, childlike styles:  \n- **Left Small Painting**: A blue sky (top 2/3) with a green ground (bottom 1/3). A kopje (triangle, 30px tall × 15px wide) is centered, with two small trees (bushy triangles) behind it.  \n- **Right Small Painting**: A yellow sky (top 2/3) with a green ground (bottom 1/3). A kopje (same size as left) is centered, with a **sun** (a yellow circle, 15px diameter) in the top-right corner and wispy cloud lines (curved strokes) below it.\n\n#### **Art Supplies on the Ground**\n- **Paint Cup**: A blue cylinder (20px tall × 15px wide) with a white rim, holding three brown paintbrushes (thin rectangles, 25px long × 2px wide) with white bristles. Positioned 30px to the left of the rhino’s front legs.  \n- **Discarded Paint Tube**: A bright red rectangle (30px long × 10px wide) with a white cap, lying on its side. Positioned 20px to the right of the rhino’s front legs.  \n- **Loose Canvas/Sheet**: A rectangular sheet (80px tall × 60px wide) lying flat on the ground, 50px to the left of the rhino. It features a **drawing of a rhino** (a yellow oval with a black outline, 20px tall × 15px wide) and a **red heart** (10px diameter) next to it.  \n- **Rock**: An irregular oval (15px tall × 20px wide) with a rough edge, positioned 40px to the right of the paint tube.\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Mountains**: A series of low, curved lines (gray-brown) spanning the top 1/5 of the image, creating a distant horizon.  \n- **Acacia Tree**: A tall, thin trunk (brown rectangle, 80px tall × 5px wide) with a flat, bushy top (green irregular shape, 40px tall × 50px wide). Positioned in the top-right corner, 100px from the right edge.  \n- **Sky**: A gradient field (see *Colors*) occupying the top 1/3 of the image, with soft, yellow cloud shapes (curved, irregular ovals) scattered across it.  \n- **Savanna Ground**: A green field (see *Colors*) occupying the bottom 2/3 of the image, with short, curved grass strokes (10px long × 1px wide) scattered evenly.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are bright and cheerful, with warm tones (sunset sky) contrasting with cool greens (savanna) and neutral grays (rhino). Textures are simple and cartoonish, with gradient fills for depth and flat colors for simplicity. Below are **hex color values** (where applicable) and texture notes:\n\n#### **Rhino**\n- **Body/Ears**: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with a subtle gradient (darker gray #A9A9A9 at the edges) for volume.  \n- **Horn**: Medium gray (#808080) with a slight shine (white highlight, 5px × 5px) at the tip.  \n- **Eyes**: White (#FFFFFF) with black pupils (#000000).  \n- **Mouth**: Pink (#FFC0CB) for the inner lip (optional, but adds warmth).\n\n#### **Easel and Paintings**\n- **Easel**: Brown (#8B4513) with a weathered look (light brown #D2B48C highlights on the edges).  \n- **Main Canvas Frame**: Brown (#8B4513), 5px wide.  \n- **Main Painting Sky**: A gradient from orange (#FFA500) at the top to yellow (#FFFF00) at the bottom.  \n- **Main Painting Ground**: Green (#90EE90).  \n- **Main Painting Kopje**: Gray (#A9A9A9) with a light gray (#D3D3D3) highlight on the left edge.  \n- **Main Painting Trees**: Brown trunks (#8B4513) with green foliage (#228B22).  \n- **Small Paintings**:  \n  - Left: Blue sky (#87CEEB), green ground (#90EE90).  \n  - Right: Yellow sky (#FFFF00), green ground (#90EE90), sun (#FFD700).  \n- **Paint Palette**: Beige (#F5F5DC) with paint splotches: red (#FF0000), yellow (#FFFF00), blue (#0000FF), white (#FFFFFF), and orange (#FFA500).  \n- **Paintbrush**: Brown handle (#8B4513), white bristles (#FFFFFF) with a dab of orange paint (#FFA500) on the tip.\n\n#### **Art Supplies**\n- **Paint Cup**: Blue (#1E90FF) with a white rim (#FFFFFF).  \n- **Paintbrushes**: Brown (#8B4513) handles with white (#FFFFFF) bristles.  \n- **Paint Tube**: Bright red (#FF0000) with a white (#FFFFFF) cap.  \n- **Loose Canvas**: Light blue (#ADD8E6) background with a yellow rhino (#FFFF00) and red heart (#FF0000).  \n- **Rock**: Gray-brown (#808060) with a rough texture (subtle noise filter or dashed outline).\n\n#### **Background**\n- **Sky**: Gradient from orange (#FFA500) at the top to yellow (#FFFF00) at the bottom. Clouds are pale yellow (#FFFFE0) with soft edges.  \n- **Mountains**: Gray-brown (#808060) with a slight gradient (lighter #A9A980 at the top) to suggest distance.  \n- **Acacia Tree**: Brown trunk (#8B4513) with green foliage (#228B22) (flat color, no gradient).  \n- **Savanna Ground**: Green (#90EE90) with lighter green (#98FB98) grass strokes (short, curved lines) to add texture.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nAll objects are positioned relative to the **center of the image** (defined as the midpoint of the main easel). Below are precise coordinates (assuming a 600px wide × 400px tall canvas) and spatial rules:\n\n#### **Rhino**\n- **Position**: Left of center, 150px from the left edge, 100px from the bottom edge.  \n- **Z-Index**: Front layer (above the easel and ground).  \n- **Relationship to Easel**: Standing 20px to the left of the easel’s central pole.\n\n#### **Easel**\n- **Position**: Center of the image, 300px from the left edge, 50px from the bottom edge.  \n- **Z-Index**: Middle layer (below the rhino, above the ground).  \n- **Main Canvas**: Attached to the easel, 10px above the ground, 10px below the top bar.\n\n#### **Small Paintings**\n- **Left Small Painting**: Propped against the easel’s left leg, 250px from the left edge, 80px from the bottom edge. Tilted 10° to the right.  \n- **Right Small Painting**: Propped against the easel’s right leg, 350px from the left edge, 80px from the bottom edge. Tilted 10° to the left.  \n- **Z-Index**: Middle layer (below the easel, above the ground).\n\n#### **Art Supplies**\n- **Paint Cup**: 80px from the left edge, 120px from the bottom edge (left of the rhino’s front legs).  \n- **Paint Tube**: 220px from the left edge, 110px from the bottom edge (between the rhino and easel).  \n- **Loose Canvas**: 50px from the left edge, 150px from the bottom edge (far left, lying flat).  \n- **Rock**: 450px from the left edge, 130px from the bottom edge (right of the paint tube).  \n- **Z-Index**: Ground layer (below all other objects except the savanna).\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Sky**: Top 1/3 of the canvas (0px to 133px from the top).  \n- **Mountains**: Top 1/5 of the canvas (0px to 80px from the top), spanning the entire width.  \n- **Acacia Tree**: Top-right corner, 500px from the left edge, 20px from the top edge.  \n- **Savanna Ground**: Bottom 2/3 of the canvas (133px to 400px from the top).  \n- **Z-Index**: Background layer (below all other objects).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **cartoonish, naive style** with the following key traits:\n- **Line Work**: Soft, rounded edges (no sharp corners) for all objects (e.g., rhino’s body, easel legs). Lines are 2px thick, black (#000000), and slightly blurred (optional, for a hand-drawn look).  \n- **Gradient Usage**: Limited to the sky (orange → yellow) and rhino’s body (light gray → darker gray) to add depth without complexity.  \n- **Childlike Paintings**: The main easel painting and smaller artworks use **flat colors** and **simple shapes** (triangles for trees, circles for the sun) to mimic a beginner’s art style.  \n- **Negative Space**: The savanna ground uses negative space (empty green area) to balance the busy left side (rhino, art supplies) with the empty right side (acacia tree).  \n- **Mood**: Cheerful and whimsical, created by the rhino’s smile, bright colors, and warm sunset sky.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**\n- **Content**: \"You see the world as you are!\"  \n- **Position**: Bottom of the image, spanning the entire width (0px to 600px from the left edge), 30px from the bottom edge.  \n- **Style**: Sans-serif font (e.g., Arial), 24px tall, white (#FFFFFF) color, centered.  \n- **Background**: A black (#000000) rectangular bar (600px wide × 40px tall) behind the text, spanning the bottom of the canvas.  \n- **Z-Index**: Top layer (above all other objects).\n\n#### **Symbols and Minor Details**\n- **Paint Palette Splotches**: Irregular circles (5px to 10px diameter) of red, yellow, blue, white, and orange, scattered randomly on the beige palette.  \n- **Grass Strokes**: Short, curved lines (10px long × 1px wide) in lighter green (#98FB98), scattered evenly across the savanna ground. No two strokes are identical (randomize angle and position slightly).  \n- **Clouds**: Soft, irregular ovals (20px to 40px wide) in pale yellow (#FFFFE0), positioned in the top 1/3 of the sky. Use a \"blur\" effect (SVG filter: `feGaussianBlur`) to make edges soft.  \n- **Sun in Right Small Painting**: A yellow circle (15px diameter) with a white highlight (3px diameter) in the top-right corner, surrounded by three short, curved rays (yellow, 5px long) to suggest shine.\n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these vector-specific rules:\n- **Layers**: Organize objects into layers (e.g., \"Background\" → \"Ground\" → \"Easel\" → \"Rhino\" → \"Text\") for easy editing.  \n- **Shapes**: Use **closed paths** for all objects (e.g., rhino’s body as a single oval, not separate lines).  \n- **Gradients**: Define linear gradients for the sky (orange → yellow) and rhino’s body (light gray → darker gray) using SVG’s `<linearGradient>` element.  \n- **Filters**: Apply a subtle `feGaussianBlur` (stdDeviation=\"1\") to the clouds and grass strokes to soften edges.  \n- **Text**: Use SVG’s `<text>` element with the specified font and positioning. The black background bar should be a `<rect>` element behind the text.  \n- **Responsiveness**: Set the canvas to 600px × 400px (standard for web graphics) and use relative units (e.g., percentages) for positioning to maintain scale on different screens.\n\n\n### **Summary of Key SVG Elements**\n| Object               | Core Shape       | Color (Hex)       | Position (600px × 400px) |\n|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| Rhino Body           | Rounded Oval     | #D3D3D3 (gradient)| 150px left, 100px bottom |\n| Main Easel           | Triangle + Bar   | #8B4513           | 300px left, 50px bottom  |\n| Main Canvas Sky      | Gradient Rectangle | #FFA500 → #FFFF00 | 300px left, 50px bottom  |\n| Savanna Ground       | Rectangle        | #90EE90           | 0px left, 133px top      |\n| Bottom Text Bar      | Rectangle        | #000000           | 0px left, 360px top      |\n| Text                 | Sans-Serif       | #FFFFFF           | Centered, 370px top      |\n\n\nThis detailed breakdown provides all the information needed to recreate the image as a scalable, editable SVG. The focus on geometric precision, color accuracy, and spatial relationships ensures the final product will match the original’s whimsical charm while being fully adaptable for digital use.",
  "v1_154": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its components, focusing on geometry, color, texture, and layout. The image is a **split-screen composite** (16:9 aspect ratio, typical of video/meme content) with two equal-width vertical halves. The left half features two women reacting dynamically, while the right half shows a cat and a salad scene—creating a humorous contrast.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is divided into **two equal vertical halves** (left: 50% width, right: 50% width) separated by a 1px black (#000000) border. Below is a breakdown of each half:\n\n---\n\n#### **Left Half: Two Women Reacting**\nThe left half centers on two standing women, closely positioned (shoulder-to-shoulder) against a dark, leafy background.  \n- **Blonde Woman (Left)**:  \n  - **Body**: 0.8x height of the left half, standing upright.  \n  - **Hair**: Long, wavy, covering shoulders (0.3x height of the left half).  \n  - **Arm**: Extended horizontally to the right (across 0.4x width of the left half), with a **fist** (index finger pointing right).  \n  - **Ring**: Large, gold, flower-shaped (5 petals) on the index finger of the pointing hand.  \n  - **Facial Features**: Wide-open mouth (showing teeth/tongue), raised eyebrows, wide eyes.  \n- **Dark-Haired Woman (Right)**:  \n  - **Body**: 0.8x height of the left half, standing slightly behind the blonde woman.  \n  - **Hair**: Long, straight, falling to her waist (0.7x height of the left half).  \n  - **Top**: Patterned (floral/metallic) with gold accents.  \n  - **Facial Features**: Wide eyes, slightly open mouth, raised eyebrows (reacting to the blonde’s pointing).  \n- **Background**: Dark blue (#1a1a2e) with green (#2ecc71) leaves and white (#ffffff) flowers.\n\n---\n\n#### **Right Half: Cat and Salad Scene**\nThe right half features a table with a salad, a cat, and a hand, set against a dark background.  \n- **Table**: Bottom 1/3 of the right half (0.3x height), dark (#444444) surface.  \n- **Salad Plate**: Round, white (#ffffff) with a thin gray (#808080) rim (0.4x width of the right half).  \n  - **Salad**: Green (#2e8b57) leafy greens, red (#ff0000) cherry tomatoes, yellow (#ffff00) pepper slices, dark purple (#4b0082) dressing.  \n  - **Fork**: Silver (#c0c0c0), lying diagonally on the right side of the plate (tines up).  \n- **Vase**: Tall, clear glass (#e0e0e0) with transparency (0.3x width, 0.4x height of the right half), centered behind the plate.  \n- **Cat**: White (#ffffff) with fluffy fur, head sticking above the table (0.2x width, 0.15x height of the right half).  \n  - **Features**: Pointy ears (light gray (#d3d3d3) shading), pink (#ff69b4) nose, half-closed eyes (black (#000000) pupils), slightly open mouth.  \n- **Hand**: Light skin (#f0d0b0), extended from the top right (0.15x width, 0.1x height of the right half). Fingers straight, thumb bent, reaching toward the cat.  \n- **Background**: Dark gray (#000000) with subtle shadows (#444444).\n\n---\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified in hex codes for precision. Textures are described in terms of SVG-replicable techniques (gradients, patterns, opacity).\n\n| Element | Color | Texture/Visual Property |\n|---------|-------|-------------------------|\n| **Blonde Woman** | Hair: #f8e0b9 (pale yellow) with #f0c88c (highlight) gradients | Wavy, textured (use path with wavy outline + gradient). |\n|  | Top: #000000 (matte black) | Smooth, solid. |\n|  | Ring: #ffd700 (gold) | Shiny (use radial gradient: #ffd700 center to #b8860b edge). |\n|  | Skin: #f0d0b0 (light) with #d0a080 (shadow) gradients | Smooth, subtle shadows on cheeks/jaw. |\n| **Dark-Haired Woman** | Hair: #3d2b1f (deep brown) | Straight, smooth (use path with straight lines + gradient). |\n|  | Top: #8b4513 (brown) with #ffd700 (gold) floral pattern | Patterned (use clip-path or repeated flower shapes). |\n|  | Skin: Similar to blonde, but with warmer (#d0a080) shadows | Smooth. |\n| **Cat** | Fur: #ffffff (white) with #d3d3d3 (gray) shading on ears/face | Fluffy (use stippling pattern or small circles for texture). |\n|  | Nose: #ff69b4 (pink) | Smooth, solid. |\n| **Salad Plate** | Plate: #ffffff (white) with #808080 (gray) rim | Smooth, slightly glossy (use linear gradient: #ffffff center to #e0e0e0 edge). |\n|  | Salad Greens: #2e8b57 (sea green) with #1e603d (dark green) veins | Crisp (use path with vein details + gradient). |\n|  | Pepper: #ffff00 (yellow) | Smooth, solid. |\n| **Vase** | Glass: #e0e0e0 (light gray) | Transparent (set opacity to 0.8) with faint reflection (add subtle #ffffff spot). |\n| **Hand** | Skin: #f0d0b0 (light) with #d0a080 (shadow) on knuckles | Smooth, subtle shadows. |\n| **Backgrounds** | Left: #1a1a2e (dark blue) with #2ecc71 (green) leaves/white (#ffffff) flowers | Leafy (use path with leaf shapes + solid colors). |\n|  | Right: #000000 (black) with #444444 (dark gray) shadows | Flat, dark (use solid color with subtle gradient). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image is a **16:9 rectangle** (total width = 2x left/right half width). Key alignments:  \n- **Left Half**:  \n  - Blonde woman (left) and dark-haired woman (right) stand side by side (0.5x width each).  \n  - Blonde’s pointing hand is at the **right edge of the left half** (center of the entire image), directing focus to the right half.  \n- **Right Half**:  \n  - **Table**: Bottom 1/3 (0.7x–1.0x height).  \n  - **Salad Plate**: Centered horizontally on the table (0.3x–0.7x width).  \n  - **Cat**: Head above the table (0.5x–0.7x height), aligned with the blonde’s hand (center of the entire image).  \n  - **Vase**: Behind the plate (0.3x–0.7x height), centered horizontally.  \n  - **Hand**: Top right (0.1x–0.3x height), reaching toward the cat.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Genre**: Meme/composite (split-screen from TV show + cat scene).  \n- **Style**: Realistic (photographic) with a humorous contrast between the women’s dramatic reaction and the cat’s nonchalant expression.  \n- **Lighting**: Warm on the left (women) with soft backlighting from the greenery; cool on the right (cat) with harsh front lighting to make the cat stand out.  \n- **Composition**: Balanced (left half: vertical focus on women; right half: horizontal focus on table/cat). The blonde’s pointing hand creates a visual link between the two halves.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No text** in the image.  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - Blonde’s gold ring (flower shape) is a key visual detail (use a 5-petal path with a central dot).  \n  - Cat’s “sassy” expression (half-closed eyes, open mouth) is critical for the meme’s humor (use precise eye/mouth paths).  \n- **Specific Details**:  \n  - **Blonde’s Face**: Wide eyes (0.05x width each), raised eyebrows (#3d2b1f), open mouth showing white (#ffffff) teeth and dark pink (#ff1493) tongue.  \n  - **Dark-Haired Woman’s Face**: Wide eyes (0.04x width each), slightly raised eyebrows (#000000), open mouth (0.03x height).  \n  - **Cat’s Whiskers**: Thin, white (#ffffff) lines extending from the nose (use 1px paths).  \n  - **Fork**: 4 tines (0.02x width each), handle curved (use path with tine details).  \n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo recreate this image accurately in SVG:  \n1. **Structure**: Use a `<svg>` element with a 16:9 viewBox (e.g., `viewBox=\"0 0 1920 1080\"`).  \n2. **Split-Screen**: Add a `<rect>` (width=\"1\" height=\"1080\" x=\"960\" fill=\"#000000\") to separate the left/right halves.  \n3. **Left Half**:  \n   - Draw the two women using `<path>` elements for hair, bodies, and clothing. Use gradients for texture (e.g., blonde hair: `<linearGradient>` from #f8e0b9 to #f0c88c).  \n   - Add the greenery background using `<path>` elements for leaves/flowers (solid colors).  \n4. **Right Half**:  \n   - Draw the table as a `<rect>` (fill=\"#444444\").  \n   - Use `<circle>` for the plate (fill=\"#ffffff\") and `<path>` elements for the salad components (gradients for greens/veggies).  \n   - Draw the cat using a `<path>` for the head/body (stippling pattern for fur) and `<circle>`/`<path>` for eyes/nose.  \n   - Add the hand using a `<path>` (subtle gradients for shadows) and the vase using a `<rect>` (opacity=\"0.8\" with a reflection spot).  \n5. **Details**: Use `<line>` for whiskers, `<path>` for the fork, and `<ellipse>` for eyes. Add `<defs>` for gradients/patterns to reuse.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, you can recreate the image with precision, capturing all visual and contextual details.",
  "v1_155": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed breakdown of its components, including geometric properties, colors, layout, and style. The image is a minimalist, meme-style illustration with a cartoonish face and Chinese text.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of five primary elements:  \n- **Background**: A solid white rectangle (full image size).  \n- **Head**: A large, circular \"face\" (dominant element).  \n- **Neck/Collar**: A black, trapezoidal shape below the head, resembling a collar or bib.  \n- **Facial Features**:  \n  - **Eyes**: Two oval shapes with a smudged effect.  \n  - **Mouth**: A thin, slightly downturned line.  \n- **Hair**: Three wispy, curved strands on the top of the head.  \n- **Text**: Two lines of Chinese characters at the bottom.  \n\n\n### **2.

Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalist Meme Style**: Simple shapes, limited color palette (white, black, gray), and flat fills.  \n- **Cartoonish Tone**: Exaggerated facial features (smudged eyes) and wispy hair convey a tired/reluctant expression.  \n- **Symmetry**: Eyes and text are horizontally centered for balance.  \n- **Texture**: The only texture is the **blurred eyes**, which add a \"sleepy\" or \"groggy\" effect.  \n- **Negative Space**: The white background and large head create negative space that draws attention to the face and text.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \nTwo lines of Chinese text are centered at the bottom of the image. The text is **sans-serif** (e.g., `Heiti SC` or `Arial`) and uses a consistent font size (24px) with a 10px margin between lines.  \n\n| Line | Text                | Translation                                  |\n|------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| 1    | 除了睡觉时间不想睡觉 | \"Except for sleeping time, I don’t want to sleep\" |\n| 2    | 其他时间都想睡觉     | \"At all other times, I want to sleep\"        |\n\n#### **Key Details for SVG**  \n- **Blur Effect**: Apply a Gaussian blur filter to the eyes using `<filter id=\"blur\"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"1\"/></filter>`.  \n- **Hair Strands**: Use `path` elements with bezier curves for natural, wispy lines (e.g., `d=\"M200 100 Q210 80 220 60\"`).  \n- **Neck/Collar**: The trapezoid has **rounded bottom edges** (achieved with `Q` (quadratic bezier) commands in the `path`).  \n- **Mouth**: A slightly downturned line (use `line` or `path` with a small curve to convey a neutral/tired expression).  \n\n\n### **Summary of SVG Structure**\nThe SVG will follow this hierarchy (from bottom to top):  \n1.

Adjustments to font family or blur intensity can be made based on desired fidelity, but the core elements (shapes, colors, layout) are preserved for precise reproduction.",
  "v1_156": "To accurately reproduce this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its **geometric shapes, proportions, color scheme, spatial relationships, and stylistic choices**. The image is a **minimalist, cartoonish panda face** (a classic \"surprised meme\" template) with exaggerated features for emotional impact. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of a **simplified panda face** with five key components:  \n- **Face**: A wide, rounded rectangle (oval-like) forming the base.  \n- **Ears**: Two large, circular \"half-ears\" attached to the top-left and top-right of the face.  \n- **Eyes**: Two small, perfect circles centered horizontally above the nose.  \n- **Nose**: A flattened oval (ellipse) between the eyes.  \n- **Mouth**: A wide, open shape with two horizontal rectangles for teeth (upper and lower).  \n\nAll elements are **symmetric along the vertical axis** (left-right balance), a defining feature of meme-style faces.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **monochromatic (black and white)** with **flat, solid colors** (no gradients, textures, or strokes). This minimalism is critical for the meme’s iconic look:  \n- **Face**: Solid white (#FFFFFF).  \n- **Ears, Eyes, Nose, Mouth Cavity**: Solid black (#000000).  \n- **Teeth**: Solid white (#FFFFFF) (matches the face).  \n\nNo outlines or borders are used—elements are defined by their fill color alone.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nAll elements are positioned relative to the **face**, which serves as the coordinate system. For scalability, we use **percentage-based proportions** (e.g., 10% of the face width) rather than fixed pixels. Below are the key measurements (assuming the face has a **width-to-height ratio of 3:2**—e.g., 600px wide × 400px tall):  \n\n| Element          | Proportions (Relative to Face)                                                                 |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Face**         | Width = \\(W\\), Height = \\(H = \\frac{2}{3}W\\). Rounded corners: \\(rx = ry = 10\\%\\) of \\(W\\) (e.g., 60px for \\(W=600\\)). |\n| **Ears**         | Two circles: <br> - **Left Ear**: Center at (\\(17\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(12.5\\%\\) of \\(H\\)), Radius = \\(17\\%\\) of \\(W\\). <br> - **Right Ear**: Center at (\\(83\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(12.5\\%\\) of \\(H\\)), Radius = \\(17\\%\\) of \\(W\\). <br> *Note*: Ears overlap the top of the face (only the bottom half of each circle is visible). |\n| **Eyes**         | Two circles: <br> - **Left Eye**: Center at (\\(35\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(30\\%\\) of \\(H\\)), Radius = \\(5\\%\\) of \\(W\\). <br> - **Right Eye**: Center at (\\(65\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(30\\%\\) of \\(H\\)), Radius = \\(5\\%\\) of \\(W\\). <br> *Spacing*: Eyes are \\(30\\%\\) of \\(W\\) apart (center-to-center). |\n| **Nose**         | Ellipse: Center at (\\(50\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(45\\%\\) of \\(H\\)), Horizontal Radius = \\(7.5\\%\\) of \\(W\\), Vertical Radius = \\(2.5\\%\\) of \\(H\\). |\n| **Mouth**        | A compound shape formed by two **quadratic curves** (upper/lower lips) and two rectangles (teeth): <br> - **Upper Lip**: Curve spanning \\(10\\%\\) to \\(90\\%\\) of \\(W\\) (left to right), with a control point at (\\(50\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(70\\%\\) of \\(H\\)) (creates a downward convex arc). <br> - **Lower Lip**: Curve spanning \\(20\\%\\) to \\(80\\%\\) of \\(W\\) (left to right), with a control point at (\\(50\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(60\\%\\) of \\(H\\)) (creates an upward convex arc). <br> - **Mouth Cavity**: The area between the upper and lower lips (filled black). <br> - **Teeth**: <br>   - **Upper Teeth**: Rectangle spanning \\(15\\%\\) to \\(85\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(5\\%\\) of \\(H\\) tall (positioned at the bottom of the upper lip). <br>   - **Lower Teeth**: Rectangle spanning \\(25\\%\\) to \\(75\\%\\) of \\(W\\), \\(5\\%\\) of \\(H\\) tall (positioned at the top of the lower lip). |\n\n#### **Spatial Hierarchy**\nElements are stacked in the following order (from bottom to top):  \n1. Face (white)  \n2. Ears (black)  \n3. Eyes (black)  \n4. Nose (black)  \n5. Mouth cavity (black)  \n6. Teeth (white)  \n\nThis ensures the teeth appear \"inside\" the mouth and the face is the background.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image follows a **meme-style aesthetic** with three core principles:  \n- **Minimalism**: Few elements (only 5 components) and no unnecessary details (e.g., no fur texture, no facial shading).  \n- **Exaggeration**: The mouth is the most prominent feature (occupies ~30% of the face height) to emphasize surprise. Eyes are small (5% of face width) to contrast with the wide mouth.  \n- **Simplicity**: Shapes are basic (rectangles, circles, ellipses) to ensure readability at small sizes (critical for memes).  \n\nThe overall mood is **playful and expressive**—the wide mouth and small eyes evoke a \"shocked\" or \"excited\" emotion.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThere is **no text or symbols** in the image. Key specific details for SVG accuracy:  \n- **Ears**: Although drawn as full circles, only the **bottom half** is visible (the top half extends beyond the face’s bounds). This is achieved by positioning the circle’s center above the face (e.g., \\(12.5\\%\\) of \\(H\\) from the top).  \n- **Mouth**: The upper lip is wider than the lower lip (spans 80% of the face width vs. 60%) to create a \"wide open\" effect.  \n- **Teeth**: The upper teeth are wider than the lower teeth (70% of face width vs. 50%) to mimic the natural shape of an open mouth.  \n- **Symmetry**: Every element (ears, eyes, mouth) is perfectly mirrored along the vertical axis. This is non-negotiable for the meme’s iconic look.\n\n\n### **SVG Implementation Guidelines**\nTo recreate the image as an SVG, use the following **geometric primitives** and **coordinate system** (assuming a face size of \\(600px\\) wide × \\(400px\\) tall):  \n\n#### **1. Face (Rounded Rectangle)**\n```svg\n<rect \n  x=\"0\" y=\"0\" \n  width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \n  rx=\"60\" ry=\"60\" \n  fill=\"#FFFFFF\"\n/>\n```\n- \\(rx = ry = 10\\%\\) of \\(600px = 60px\\) (rounded corners).  \n- Fills the entire SVG viewbox (\\(viewBox=\"0 0 600 400\"\\)).\n\n#### **2. Ears (Circles)**\n```svg\n<!-- Left Ear -->\n<circle \n  cx=\"100\" cy=\"50\" \n  r=\"100\" \n  fill=\"#000000\"\n/>\n<!-- Right Ear -->\n<circle \n  cx=\"500\" cy=\"50\" \n  r=\"100\" \n  fill=\"#000000\"\n/>\n```\n- **Left Ear**: Center at \\(17\\%\\) of \\(600px = 100px\\) (x), \\(12.5\\%\\) of \\(400px = 50px\\) (y). Radius = \\(17\\%\\) of \\(600px = 100px\\).  \n- **Right Ear**: Mirrors the left ear (x = \\(600 - 100 = 500px\\)).\n\n#### **3. Eyes (Circles)**\n```svg\n<!-- Left Eye -->\n<circle \n  cx=\"210\" cy=\"120\" \n  r=\"30\" \n  fill=\"#000000\"\n/>\n<!-- Right Eye -->\n<circle \n  cx=\"390\" cy=\"120\" \n  r=\"30\" \n  fill=\"#000000\"\n/>\n```\n- **Left Eye**: Center at \\(35\\%\\) of \\(600px = 210px\\) (x), \\(30\\%\\) of \\(400px = 120px\\) (y). Radius = \\(5\\%\\) of \\(600px = 30px\\).  \n- **Right Eye**: Mirrors the left eye (x = \\(600 - 210 = 390px\\)).\n\n#### **4. Nose (Ellipse)**\n```svg\n<ellipse \n  cx=\"300\" cy=\"180\" \n  rx=\"45\" ry=\"10\" \n  fill=\"#000000\"\n/>\n```\n- Center at \\(50\\%\\) of \\(600px = 300px\\) (x), \\(45\\%\\) of \\(400px = 180px\\) (y).  \n- Horizontal radius = \\(7.5\\%\\) of \\(600px = 45px\\).  \n- Vertical radius = \\(2.5\\%\\) of \\(400px = 10px\\) (flattened to look like a panda’s nose).\n\n#### **5. Mouth (Path + Rectangles)**\nThe mouth is a **compound shape** made of two quadratic curves (upper/lower lips) and two rectangles (teeth). The curves are drawn using SVG’s `<path>` element with `Q` (quadratic bezier) commands.  \n\n```svg\n<!-- Mouth Cavity (Black) -->\n<path \n  d=\"M60 220 Q 300 280 540 220 L 480 300 Q 300 240 120 300 L 60 220\" \n  fill=\"#000000\"\n/>\n<!-- Upper Teeth (White) -->\n<rect \n  x=\"90\" y=\"220\" \n  width=\"420\" height=\"20\" \n  fill=\"#FFFFFF\"\n/>\n<!-- Lower Teeth (White) -->\n<rect \n  x=\"150\" y=\"300\" \n  width=\"300\" height=\"20\" \n  fill=\"#FFFFFF\"\n/>\n```\n- **Mouth Cavity Path**:  \n  - `M60 220`: Starts at the left end of the upper lip (10% of \\(600px = 60px\\), 55% of \\(400px = 220px\\)).  \n  - `Q 300 280 540 220`: Draws a quadratic curve to the right end of the upper lip (90% of \\(600px = 540px\\)), with a control point at the center of the face (300px) and 70% of \\(400px = 280px\\) (creates a downward arc).  \n  - `L 480 300`: Lines to the right end of the lower lip (80% of \\(600px = 480px\\), 75% of \\(400px = 300px\\)).  \n  - `Q 300 240 120 300`: Draws a quadratic curve to the left end of the lower lip (20% of \\(600px = 120px\\)), with a control point at the center of the face (300px) and 60% of \\(400px = 240px\\) (creates an upward arc).  \n  - `L 60 220`: Closes the path by lining back to the start.  \n- **Upper Teeth**: Spans 15% to 85% of \\(600px\\) (90px to 510px), 5% of \\(400px = 20px\\) tall. Positioned at the bottom of the upper lip (y = 220px).  \n- **Lower Teeth**: Spans 25% to 75% of \\(600px\\) (150px to 450px), 5% of \\(400px = 20px\\) tall. Positioned at the top of the lower lip (y = 300px).\n\n\n### **Final SVG Code**\nCombining all elements, the complete SVG (with a \\(600px × 400px\\) viewbox) is:  \n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 600 400\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Face (White Rounded Rectangle) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" rx=\"60\" ry=\"60\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Ears (Black Circles) -->\n  <circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"50\" r=\"100\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"50\" r=\"100\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Eyes (Black Circles) -->\n  <circle cx=\"210\" cy=\"120\" r=\"30\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"390\" cy=\"120\" r=\"30\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Nose (Black Ellipse) -->\n  <ellipse cx=\"300\" cy=\"180\" rx=\"45\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Mouth Cavity (Black Path) -->\n  <path d=\"M60 220 Q 300 280 540 220 L 480 300 Q 300 240 120 300 L 60 220\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Teeth (White Rectangles) -->\n  <rect x=\"90\" y=\"220\" width=\"420\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n  <rect x=\"150\" y=\"300\" width=\"300\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Key Notes for Accuracy**\n- **Scalability**: The SVG uses a fixed viewbox (\\(600×400\\)), but you can adjust the `width` and `height` attributes of the `<svg>` element to scale it (e.g., `width=\"300px\" height=\"200px\"` for a smaller version).  \n- **Symmetry**: Double-check that all elements are mirrored along the vertical axis (x = 300px for a 600px wide face).  \n- **Proportions**: Maintain the 3:2 face ratio (width = 1.5 × height) to preserve the meme’s iconic look.  \n- **Z-Order**: Ensure the teeth are drawn **after** the mouth cavity (so they appear \"inside\" the mouth).  \n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s look and feel—critical for maintaining its meme-worthy charm.",
  "v1_157": "To accurately recreate the image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its elements, proportions, and style. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a close-up of a **cartoon cat’s face** (dominant subject) with exaggerated features for a meme aesthetic. Key elements include:  \n- **Ears**: Two triangular outer ears (black) with smaller inner triangular ears (pink), positioned at the top left/right.  \n- **Eyes**: Closed, with curved eyelids (light pink) and multiple teardrops (light blue) emanating from each corner.  \n- **Mouth**: A wide, semicircular opening (dark inner cavity) with a pink lip border, occupying the lower half of the face.  \n- **Whiskers**: Three thin white lines on each side of the mouth, extending outward.  \n- **Text**: The Chinese character \"妈!\" (pronounced \"mā,\" meaning \"Mom!\") centered inside the mouth.  \n- **Background**: Plain white (implied by the cat’s white fur and lack of additional elements).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **flat colors** (minimal shading) to maintain a cartoon/meme style. Key colors and textures:  \n| Element               | Color (Hex)       | Texture/Notes                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Cat fur (background)  | `#FFFFFF` (white) | Solid, smooth (implied by white canvas).       |\n| Outer ears            | `#000000` (black) | Solid, rounded tips for softness.              |\n| Inner ears            | `#FFB6C1` (light pink) | Solid, matching lip color.                     |\n| Eyelids               | `#FFE4E1` (pale pink) | Thin stroke (10px) to mimic skin under fur.    |\n| Tears                 | `#ADD8E6` (light blue) | Elliptical (teardrop shape) with a white highlight (`#FFFFFF`) for gloss. |\n| Mouth inner cavity    | `#000000` (black) | Solid, matte to emphasize depth.               |\n| Lips                  | `#FFB6C1` (light pink) | Thin stroke (5px) around the mouth opening.    |\n| Whiskers              | `#FFFFFF` (white) | Thin lines (2px stroke) for a delicate look.   |\n| Text (\"妈!\")          | `#FFFFFF` (white) | Bold sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for clarity. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **symmetric** (left/right balance) to create a recognizable, balanced face. All elements are centered on a **1000x1000px square canvas** (standard for memes). Key positions:  \n\n| Element               | Position/Proportions                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ears**              | Outer ears: Top 20% of the canvas (y=10–50px). Left ear: `(100,50) → (200,10) → (300,50)`; Right ear: symmetric. Inner ears: 70% the size of outer ears, nested inside. |\n| **Eyes**              | Centered horizontally (left eye: x=250–350px; right eye: x=650–750px) at y=200px (20% from top). Curved downward (concave) to mimic closed eyelids. |\n| **Tears**             | 5 teardrops per eye, shifting left/down (left eye) or right/down (right eye). Each tear: 15x5px ellipse, spaced 20px apart. |\n| **Mouth**             | Semicircle (clipped from a circle) centered at `(500,450)` (canvas midpoint). Radius: 300px (60% of canvas width), visible from y=300–750px (lower half). |\n| **Whiskers**          | Left whiskers: Start at mouth left edge (`x=200px`) and extend to `x=100px`. Right whiskers: Symmetric (start at `x=800px`, extend to `x=900px`). Spaced 20px apart vertically (y=400–440px). |\n| **Text**              | Centered at mouth midpoint (`500,450`). Font size: 200px (20% of canvas height) for visibility. |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image follows a **cartoon/meme style** with:  \n- **Exaggeration**: Large mouth (60% of canvas width) and over-the-top tears (5 per eye) to emphasize \"yelling\" and emotion.  \n- **Flat Design**: Solid colors with no gradients (except subtle highlights on tears) for a clean, modern look.  \n- **Symmetry**: Perfect left/right balance (ears, eyes, tears, whiskers) to create a recognizable, approachable face.  \n- **Glossy Tears**: Small white circles (`3px` radius) on each tear to add depth without realism.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text**: The character \"妈!\" is the focal point of the mouth. It uses a **bold sans-serif font** (e.g., Arial) to ensure readability against the dark mouth cavity.  \n- **Tears**: Each tear is an **ellipse** (15x5px) with a white highlight (10% of the tear size) in the upper corner (left tears: upper right; right tears: upper left) for a glossy effect.  \n- **Ears**: Outer ears have **rounded tips** (10px border radius) to avoid sharp edges, matching the cat’s soft fur.  \n- **Eyelids**: Curved using **quadratic Bezier curves** (`Q` command in SVG) to create a natural \"closed\" shape.  \n- **Mouth**: A circle (`radius=300px`) clipped to the lower half of the canvas (y≥300px) to form a semicircle. The lip border is a thin stroke (5px) around this circle.  \n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nBelow is a structured SVG template with precise coordinates, shapes, and styles. The canvas is **1000x1000px** (square) for compatibility.\n\n\n#### **Key SVG Elements**\n1. **Clipping Path for Mouth**  \n   Ensures the mouth circle is only visible in the lower half of the canvas:  \n   ```svg\n   <defs>\n     <clipPath id=\"mouthClip\">\n       <rect x=\"0\" y=\"300\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\"/> <!-- Covers lower 70% of canvas -->\n     </clipPath>\n   </defs>\n   ```\n\n2. **Ears**  \n   Outer (black) and inner (pink) triangles with rounded tips:  \n   ```svg\n   <!-- Left Outer Ear (Black) -->\n   <polygon points=\"100,50 200,10 300,50\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n   <!-- Right Outer Ear (Black) -->\n   <polygon points=\"700,50 800,10 900,50\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n   <!-- Left Inner Ear (Pink) -->\n   <polygon points=\"150,70 200,30 250,70\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#FFB6C1\"/>\n   <!-- Right Inner Ear (Pink) -->\n   <polygon points=\"750,70 800,30 850,70\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#FFB6C1\"/>\n   ```\n\n3. **Closed Eyes**  \n   Curved paths (Bezier curves) for eyelids (light pink stroke):  \n   ```svg\n   <!-- Left Eye (Pale Pink Eyelid) -->\n   <path d=\"M250,200 Q300,220 350,200\" stroke=\"#FFE4E1\" stroke-width=\"10\" fill=\"none\"/>\n   <!-- Right Eye (Pale Pink Eyelid) -->\n   <path d=\"M650,200 Q700,220 750,200\" stroke=\"#FFE4E1\" stroke-width=\"10\" fill=\"none\"/>\n   ```\n   - **Note**: The `Q` command creates a quadratic Bezier curve (control point at `(300,220)` for the left eye) to achieve the concave downward shape.\n\n4. **Tears**  \n   Ellipses (light blue) with white highlights:  \n   ```svg\n   <!-- Left Eye Tears (5 Droplets) -->\n   <ellipse cx=\"200\" cy=\"220\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"190\" cy=\"215\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/> <!-- Highlight -->\n   <ellipse cx=\"180\" cy=\"240\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"170\" cy=\"235\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n   <ellipse cx=\"160\" cy=\"260\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"150\" cy=\"255\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n   <ellipse cx=\"140\" cy=\"280\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"130\" cy=\"275\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n   <ellipse cx=\"120\" cy=\"300\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"110\" cy=\"295\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n\n   <!-- Right Eye Tears (5 Droplets, Symmetric) -->\n   <ellipse cx=\"800\" cy=\"220\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"810\" cy=\"215\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/> <!-- Highlight -->\n   <ellipse cx=\"820\" cy=\"240\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"830\" cy=\"235\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n   <ellipse cx=\"840\" cy=\"260\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"850\" cy=\"255\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n   <ellipse cx=\"860\" cy=\"280\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"870\" cy=\"275\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n   <ellipse cx=\"880\" cy=\"300\" rx=\"15\" ry=\"5\" fill=\"#ADD8E6\"/>\n   <circle cx=\"890\" cy=\"295\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n   ```\n\n5. **Mouth**  \n   Semicircle (clipped circle) with a pink lip border:  \n   ```svg\n   <!-- Inner Mouth (Dark Cavity) -->\n   <circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"450\" r=\"300\" fill=\"#000000\" clip-path=\"url(#mouthClip)\"/>\n   <!-- Lip Border (Pink) -->\n   <circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"450\" r=\"300\" stroke=\"#FFB6C1\" stroke-width=\"5\" fill=\"none\" clip-path=\"url(#mouthClip)\"/>\n   ```\n   - **Note**: The `clip-path=\"url(#mouthClip)\"` applies the pre-defined clipping path to show only the lower half of the circle (semicircle).\n\n6. **Whiskers**  \n   Thin white lines:  \n   ```svg\n   <!-- Left Whiskers (3 Lines) -->\n   <line x1=\"200\" y1=\"400\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"450\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n   <line x1=\"200\" y1=\"420\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"470\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n   <line x1=\"200\" y1=\"440\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"490\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n\n   <!-- Right Whiskers (3 Lines, Symmetric) -->\n   <line x1=\"800\" y1=\"400\" x2=\"900\" y2=\"450\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n   <line x1=\"800\" y1=\"420\" x2=\"900\" y2=\"470\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n   <line x1=\"800\" y1=\"440\" x2=\"900\" y2=\"490\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n   ```\n\n7. **Text**  \n   Centered Chinese character (\"妈!\"):  \n   ```svg\n   <text \n     x=\"500\" y=\"450\" \n     font-family=\"Arial\" \n     font-size=\"200\" \n     font-weight=\"bold\" \n     fill=\"#FFFFFF\" \n     text-anchor=\"middle\" \n     dominant-baseline=\"middle\"\n   >妈!</text>\n   ```\n   - **Alignment**: `text-anchor=\"middle\"` (horizontal center) and `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"` (vertical center) ensure the text is perfectly positioned in the mouth.\n\n\n### **Final SVG Structure**\nThe complete SVG wraps all elements in an `<svg>` tag with the specified canvas size.

  "v1_158": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties with a focus on geometric precision, texture, and spatial relationships:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **close-up of a bowl of creamy soup** resting on a wooden surface. The primary elements are:  \n- **Bowl**: A deep, circular container with a thick, rounded rim. It occupies ~85% of the image’s width and ~90% of its height, centered but slightly tilted to the right.  \n- **Soup**: A thick, creamy base filling the bowl almost to the brim. The surface curves gently to follow the bowl’s contours.  \n- **Soup Chunks**:  \n  - **Mushrooms**: The most prominent chunks—both whole caps (rounded tops, flat undersides with dark gills) and sliced pieces (cylindrical or irregularly shaped). Sizes vary: largest caps are ~10% of the bowl’s diameter, while sliced pieces are ~5–7% of the bowl’s diameter.  \n  - **Root Vegetables**: Light-colored, rectangular/oval chunks (likely potatoes or onions) with smooth edges, smaller than mushrooms (~3–5% of the bowl’s diameter).  \n- **Herbs**:  \n  - **Fresh**: Small clusters of jagged leaves (parsley or cilantro) with 3–5 lobes each, scattered on the soup’s surface.  \n  - **Dried**: Tiny, thin specks (thyme or oregano) evenly distributed but sparse.  \n- **Wooden Surface**: A table under the bowl, visible on the right and bottom edges of the image.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Bowl**  \n- **Color**: Deep matte black (#1a1a1a) with a subtle glossy reflection on the right rim (light gray gradient, #444444).  \n- **Texture**: Smooth but slightly tactile; the rim has a faint \"thickness\" defined by a 2-pixel inner shadow.  \n- **Highlights**: A thin, curved white highlight (#f0f0f0) on the right edge of the rim, mimicking light reflection.  \n\n#### **Soup**  \n- **Base Color**: Warm beige (#f0d2a8) with a hint of peach, graduating from lighter in the center (#f5d8b0) to darker at the edges (#e8c898) to simulate depth and lighting.  \n- **Texture**: Creamy and slightly viscous—represented by a solid fill with a subtle radial gradient (center light, edges dark) to mimic surface sheen.  \n- **Bubbles**: 2–3 small, round bubbles (~1–2% of the bowl’s diameter) near the right edge of the soup, with transparent centers and white highlights (#ffffff).  \n\n#### **Mushrooms**  \n- **Cap Tops**: Light tan (#d9b38c) with a glossy sheen (subtle linear gradient from top (#e6c099) to bottom (#ccaa80)).  \n- **Gills/Undersides**: Dark brown (#664422) with a matte texture, visible on flipped or sliced pieces.  \n- **Stems/Sliced Pieces**: Medium tan (#c69f78) with a smooth, slightly translucent appearance.  \n\n#### **Root Vegetables**  \n- **Color**: Pale yellow (#f2e6d9) with a matte finish, slightly translucent at the edges.  \n- **Shape**: Irregular rectangles or ovals with rounded corners.  \n\n#### **Fresh Herbs**  \n- **Color**: Bright green (#2ecc71) with darker veins (#27ae60) for depth.  \n- **Texture**: Crisp, jagged edges (simulated with 1-pixel \"notches\" on leaf lobes).  \n- **Size**: Clusters vary from ~3% (foreground) to ~1% (background) of the bowl’s diameter.  \n\n#### **Dried Herbs**  \n- **Color**: Dark brown (#332211).  \n- **Shape**: Thin, straight or curved lines (~1–2 pixels long) or tiny dots.  \n\n#### **Wooden Surface**  \n- **Color**: Medium brown (#8b5e3c) with warm highlights (#a67c52) and cool shadows (#704b2f).  \n- **Texture**: Rough, grainy surface—represented by diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) parallel lines of varying thickness (1–3 pixels) and subtle \"knot\" marks (small, irregular dark patches).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centered on the bowl**, with the following depth hierarchy (foreground to background):  \n1. **Fresh Herbs**: Concentrated in the **bottom-left**, **center**, and **bottom-right** of the soup, with some clusters partially submerged.  \n2. **Large Mushroom Chunks**: Dominant in the **left-third** and **center** of the soup, with sliced pieces scattered across the surface.  \n3. **Root Vegetables**: Interspersed between mushrooms, mostly in the **left-half** of the soup.  \n4. **Soup Base**: Fills the bowl, with the surface curving upward toward the rim.  \n5. **Bowl Rim**: Frames the soup, with the right edge overlapping the wooden surface.  \n6. **Wooden Table**: Visible on the **right** (30% of the image width) and **bottom** (15% of the image height), with the bowl’s shadow casting a soft dark patch (#333333) on the wood.  \n\n#### **Lighting**  \nA soft, diffused light source originates from the **top-left**, creating:  \n- **Highlights**: On the bowl’s right rim, the soup’s center, and mushroom cap tops.  \n- **Shadows**: Under mushroom chunks (subtle dark brown (#553311) gradients) and along the bowl’s left inner edge.  \n- **Soup Gradient**: Lighter in the center (#f5d8b0) and darker at the edges (#e8c898) to mimic light falloff.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic close-up** with a focus on texture and detail. For SVG, the style translates to:  \n- **Semi-Realistic Vector Shapes**: Smooth edges for the bowl and soup, but jagged edges for herbs and grainy lines for wood.  \n- **Gradients for Depth**: Linear/radial gradients to simulate gloss (mushrooms, bowl rim) and depth (soup, wood).  \n- **Layered Composition**:  \n  - **Background**: Wooden surface (bottom layer).  \n  - **Middle**: Bowl (with inner shadow) and soup base.  \n  - **Foreground**: Chunks, herbs, and bubbles (with varying opacity for submersion).  \n- **Subtle Blurring**: Soft edges for background elements (e.g., distant mushrooms, wood grain) to mimic depth of field.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Accuracy**\n- **Bowl**:  \n  - **Rim Thickness**: 10% of the bowl’s diameter (e.g., 80px for an 800px bowl).  \n  - **Inner Shadow**: A 5-pixel dark gray (#333333) shadow along the left inner edge to emphasize depth.  \n- **Soup**:  \n  - **Surface Tension**: A 2-pixel white (#ffffff) highlight along the left edge of the soup, where it meets the bowl.  \n  - **Bubbles**: 2–3 bubbles near the right rim, with 50% opacity to appear submerged.  \n- **Mushrooms**:  \n  - **Gill Detail**: For whole caps, add 1-pixel dark brown (#664422) lines radiating from the center of the underside.  \n  - **Submersion**: 10–20% opacity for the bottom third of each chunk to simulate being in soup.  \n- **Fresh Herbs**:  \n  - **Leaf Veins**: 1-pixel dark green (#27ae60) lines along the center of each lobe.  \n  - **Orientation**: Clusters tilted at 15–45° angles for naturalism.  \n- **Wooden Surface**:  \n  - **Grain Direction**: Diagonal lines from (100% x, 0% y) to (0% x, 100% y).  \n  - **Highlight Area**: A 200px-wide light gradient (#a67c52) on the top-right portion of the wood, where light hits.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key SVG Requirements**\n- **Layers**: Organize by depth (wood → bowl → soup → chunks → herbs → bubbles).  \n- **Gradients**: Use for gloss (mushrooms, bowl), depth (soup), and texture (wood).  \n- **Precision**: Jagged edges for herbs, grain lines for wood, and gill details for mushrooms.  \n- **Lighting**: Consistently apply top-left highlights and shadows to maintain realism.  \n\nThis description provides the geometric, color, and textural details needed to recreate the image as a faithful SVG, with attention to both macro composition and micro-details (e.g., herb veins, mushroom gills).",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is balanced, with the focal glass at the center and elements distributed to create visual flow. Use the **glass as a reference point** for positioning:\n\n| **Object**               | **Position Relative to Glass**                                                         | **Depth** (Foreground → Background) |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Focal Glass**          | **Centered** (x-axis: 50% of image width; y-axis: 60% of image height—base rests on tiles). | Foreground (closest to viewer).      |\n| **Purple Pitcher**       | **Upper left**: Base rests on the coaster, which is on the tiles. The pitcher’s top is aligned with the glass’s midpoint. | Middle ground (behind the glass).    |\n| **Regular Oranges**      | **Upper right**: Two slices, partially overlapping. The top slice is tilted slightly toward the glass. | Middle ground (next to the glass).   |\n| **Blood Oranges**        | **Lower right**: Two slices, stacked (one on top of the other). The bottom slice is larger, with a curved edge. | Foreground (rests on tiles, near the glass’s base). |\n| **Limes**                | **Lower right**: Lime wedge (next to blood oranges) and two slices (to the right of the wedge). | Foreground (on tiles).               |\n| **Pink Petal**           | **Far left**: Resting on the tiles, to the left of the pitcher’s coaster. | Middle ground (same plane as the pitcher). |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **realistic, vibrant style** with a summery, warm tone. Key stylistic choices:\n\n- **Lighting**: Warm, soft light from the **upper left** (casts long shadows to the right and below objects). Shadows are subtle (low contrast) to maintain a bright, inviting feel.\n  - **Glass shadow**: Long, rectangular shadow on the tiles (to the right of the glass, ~1.5x the glass’s width).\n  - **Fruit shadows**: Small, curved shadows under each slice (to the right).\n- **Transparency**: The glass and pitcher are **semi-transparent** (you can see ice through the glass, but the pitcher’s dark liquid obscures its interior).\n- **Gloss**: Glass, fruit balls, and pitcher have a **high-gloss finish** (subtle highlights on the upper left edges of the glass and pitcher).\n- **Texture Contrast**: Matte tiles vs. glossy glass/fruit create depth. The wall has a **plaster-like texture** (subtle noise or stippling in SVG).\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Accuracy**\nTo ensure precision in recreation, include these critical details:\n\n- **Glass Facets**: The 6 vertical bevels are evenly spaced (each facet is a trapezoid). The top edge of the glass is a hexagon (from the bevels).\n- **Ice Cubes**: Irregular shapes (not perfect cubes) with rounded edges. Place 3–4 cubes in the front (visible through the glass) and 2–3 in the back.\n- **Fruit Balls**: Uniform size (diameter ~1/4 the glass’s width). Arrange them in a loose triangle on top of the drink (one in the center, two on either side).\n- **Lime Wedge**: The toothpick is a thin line (1px in SVG) that extends ~5px beyond each end of the wedge.\n- **Tiles**: Large squares (each tile is ~1/3 the image’s height). Grout lines are thin (~2px) and light gray.\n- **Wall Texture**: Add a **subtle noise filter** (low opacity) to the wall to mimic plaster.\n- **Highlights**: For glossy objects (glass, pitcher, fruit balls), add a small, white highlight (10% opacity) on the upper left edge (aligns with the light source).\n\n\n### **Summary of Key Measurements (for Proportions)**\nUse these relative measurements to maintain balance:\n- **Glass**: Height = 1.5x width (e.g., 100px wide × 150px tall).\n- **Pitcher**: Height = 2x the glass’s height (but scaled down to 70% in the background).\n- **Fruit Balls**: Diameter = 1/4 the glass’s width (e.g., 25px for a 100px wide glass).\n- **Orange Slices**: Width = 1/2 the glass’s width (e.g., 50px for a 100px wide glass).\n- **Tiles**: Each tile is 1.5x the glass’s width (e.g., 150px × 150px for a 100px wide glass).\n\n\n### **SVG Layer Order (Bottom → Top)**\n1. Background wall (plaster texture)\n2. Terracotta tiles (with grout)\n3. Pitcher coaster (textured)\n4. Purple pitcher (liquid + glass)\n5. Pink petal\n6. Focal glass (base → ice → beverage → top edge)\n7. Fruit balls (on top of the glass)\n8. Lime wedge + toothpick (on top of fruit balls)\n9. Regular oranges (upper right)\n10. Blood oranges (lower right)\n11. Limes (lower right)\n\n\n### **Example Hex Codes for Consistency**\n| Element                 | Hex Code       |\n|-------------------------|----------------|\n| Glass beverage          | #FFD700        |\n| Pitcher liquid          | #4B0082        |\n| Terracotta tiles        | #E2725B        |\n| Regular orange flesh    | #FF8C00        |\n| Blood orange flesh      | #DC143C        |\n| Lime rind               | #228B22        |\n| Background wall         | #D9B3A5        |\n\n\nBy following this breakdown, the SVG will accurately reflect the image’s composition, color, and texture—while maintaining the geometric precision needed for a faithful recreation.",
  "v1_16": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its components, including geometric shapes, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic traits. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s specified focus areas:\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image depicts a **functional digital display** (likely from a gas pump or retail terminal) with a gray bezel, a glossy screen, and a two-line seven-segment readout. Key elements include:\n\n### Bezel\nA rectangular frame surrounding the entire display with **sharp corners** and uniform thickness (equal margins on all sides). It serves as a border for the screen and text.\n\n### Screen\nA rectangular area within the bezel with a glossy surface. It contains:\n- **Top Line (\"This Sale\")**: A larger seven-segment number (`62.85`) with 5 characters (2 digits + decimal + 2 digits).\n- **Bottom Line (\"Gallons\")**: A smaller seven-segment number (`14.620`) with 6 characters (2 digits + decimal + 3 digits).\n- Subtle **reflections** (of a person taking the photo) and **dirt** (dust dots) on the surface.\n\n### Text\nTwo lines of white sans-serif text centered within the bezel:\n- **\"This Sale\"**: Above the screen (labels the top line as the total sale amount).\n- **\"Gallons\"**: Below the screen (labels the bottom line as the quantity of fuel).\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n### Bezel\n- **Color**: Medium gray (`#808080`).\n- **Texture**: Matte (non-glossy) for durability.\n\n### Screen\n- **Background**: Light gray (`#D3D3D3`) with a **glossy finish** (simulated via subtle gradients or reflection overlays).\n- **Dirt**: Small, irregular light gray (`#E0E0E0`) dots scattered along the bottom edge and on seven-segment segments.\n- **Reflection**: Semi-transparent white (`#FFFFFF`, 10% opacity) gradient on the left 30% of the screen, mimicking a person’s outline.\n\n### Seven-Segment Characters\n- **Color**: Solid black (`#000000`).\n- **Texture**: Slightly rough with dust (2–3 small white dots per segment).\n- **Segment Thickness**: 1/5 of the character height (e.g., 4 units for large characters, 2 units for small characters).\n\n### Text\n- **Color**: White (`#FFFFFF`).\n- **Font**: Bold sans-serif (e.g., **Arial Bold**) for readability.\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nTo maintain accuracy, use an **arbitrary unit system** (e.g., 100 units = bezel width) to preserve proportions. Key positioning rules:\n\n### Bezel vs. Screen\n- The bezel occupies 100% of the canvas (e.g., `width=\"100\" height=\"60\"`).\n- The screen is **centered** within the bezel with a 5-unit margin on all sides (e.g., `x=\"5\" y=\"5\" width=\"90\" height=\"50\"`).\n\n### Text Placement\n- **\"This Sale\"**: Centered horizontally (`x=\"50\"`), positioned 10% of the bezel height above the screen (e.g., `y=\"3\"`).\n- **\"Gallons\"**: Centered horizontally (`x=\"50\"`), positioned 10% of the bezel height below the screen (e.g., `y=\"57\"`).\n\n### Seven-Segment Readout\nThe top line (`62.85`) is **larger** (occupies 60% of the screen height) and the bottom line (`14.620`) is **smaller** (occupies 40% of the screen height). Critical alignment:\n- **Decimal Points**: Horizontally aligned (same x-coordinate) for both lines (e.g., `x=46` for the top line, `x=34` for the bottom line).\n- **Character Spacing**: Gaps between characters equal 1/2 of the character width (e.g., 6 units for large characters, 3 units for small characters).\n\n#### Top Line (`62.85`)\n| Character | Position (x, y) | Size (W×H) | Segment Thickness |\n|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|\n| `6`       | (10, 10)        | 12×20      | 4                 |\n| `2`       | (28, 10)        | 12×20      | 4                 |\n| `.`       | (46, 20)        | 4×4 (circle) | —                 |\n| `8`       | (52, 10)        | 12×20      | 4                 |\n| `5`       | (70, 10)        | 12×20      | 4                 |\n\n#### Bottom Line (`14.620`)\n| Character | Position (x, y) | Size (W×H) | Segment Thickness |\n|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|\n| `1`       | (10, 35)        | 6×10       | 2                 |\n| `4`       | (22, 35)        | 6×10       | 2                 |\n| `.`       | (34, 40)        | 2×2 (circle) | —                 |\n| `6`       | (38, 35)        | 6×10       | 2                 |\n| `2`       | (49, 35)        | 6×10       | 2                 |\n| `0`       | (60, 35)        | 6×10       | 2                 |\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n### Functional Design\nThe display is utilitarian, prioritizing readability over aesthetics. The bezel’s matte finish and screen’s gloss balance durability and visibility.\n\n### Seven-Segment Display\n- **Ratio**: Standard 3:5 width-to-height (e.g., 12×20 for large characters, 6×10 for small characters).\n- **Segments**: Horizontal/vertical rectangles with **rounded ends** (optional, but typical of modern displays).\n- **Decimal Points**: Small circles centered vertically with characters (diameter = segment thickness).\n\n### Texture Details\n- **Dirt**: 10–15 small (`1–2px`) light gray circles along the screen’s bottom edge and 2–3 per seven-segment segment.\n- **Reflection**: A linear gradient rectangle (`#FFFFFF` from 10% to 0% opacity) clipped to the left 30% of the screen, mimicking a person’s silhouette.\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Text\n- **\"This Sale\"**: All caps, bold, centered above the screen. Font size = 10% of bezel height (e.g., 6 units for a 60-unit bezel).\n- **\"Gallons\"**: All caps, bold, centered below the screen. Same font size as \"This Sale\".\n\n### Seven-Segment Characters\nEach number uses a standard seven-segment layout (labeled `a`–`g` below). Segments are **filled black** when active:\n\n| Segment | Description               |\n|---------|---------------------------|\n| `a`     | Top horizontal            |\n| `b`     | Upper right vertical      |\n| `c`     | Lower right vertical      |\n| `d`     | Bottom horizontal         |\n| `e`     | Lower left vertical       |\n| `f`     | Upper left vertical       |\n| `g`     | Middle horizontal         |\n\n#### Top Line (`62.85`)\n| Character | Active Segments       |\n|-----------|-----------------------|\n| `6`       | `a`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `c` |\n| `2`       | `a`, `b`, `g`, `e`, `d` |\n| `8`       | All (`a`–`g`)         |\n| `5`       | `a`, `f`, `g`, `c`, `d` |\n\n#### Bottom Line (`14.620`)\n| Character | Active Segments       |\n|-----------|-----------------------|\n| `1`       | `b`, `c`              |\n| `4`       | `f`, `g`, `b`, `c`    |\n| `6`       | `a`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `c` |\n| `2`       | `a`, `b`, `g`, `e`, `d` |\n| `0`       | `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` |\n\n### Dirt and Reflection\n- **Dirt**: Use a `<g>` element with multiple `<circle>` elements (`r=\"0.5\"`–`1`, `fill=\"#E0E0E0\"`) scattered along the screen’s bottom edge (`y=55` units) and on segments.\n- **Reflection**: A `<rect>` element (`x=5`, `y=5`, `width=27`, `height=50`) with a linear gradient (`<linearGradient>` from `#FFFFFF` (10% opacity) to `#000000` (0% opacity)) clipped to the screen area.\n\n\n## 6. SVG Implementation Guidelines\nTo recreate the image accurately, follow these steps in SVG:\n\n### 1. Define the Bezel\n```svg\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#808080\" rx=\"0\" ry=\"0\"/> <!-- Sharp corners -->\n```\n\n### 2. Add the Screen\n```svg\n<rect x=\"5\" y=\"5\" width=\"90\" height=\"50\" fill=\"#D3D3D3\" stroke=\"none\"/>\n<!-- Reflection (optional) -->\n<clipPath id=\"screenClip\">\n  <rect x=\"5\" y=\"5\" width=\"90\" height=\"50\"/>\n</clipPath>\n<rect x=\"5\" y=\"5\" width=\"27\" height=\"50\" fill=\"url(#reflectionGradient)\" clip-path=\"url(#screenClip)\"/>\n<linearGradient id=\"reflectionGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"0\">\n  <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\" stop-opacity=\"0.1\"/>\n  <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\" stop-opacity=\"0\"/>\n</linearGradient>\n```\n\n### 3. Add Text\n```svg\n<text x=\"50\" y=\"3\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"6\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">This Sale</text>\n<text x=\"50\" y=\"57\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"6\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Gallons</text>\n```\n\n### 4. Draw Seven-Segment Characters\nUse a `<g>` element for each character, with `<rect>` elements for active segments. Example for the top-line `6`:\n```svg\n<g id=\"top-6\" transform=\"translate(10, 10)\">\n  <!-- Segment a (top) -->\n  <rect x=\"1\" y=\"0\" width=\"10\" height=\"4\" fill=\"#000000\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Segment d (bottom) -->\n  <rect x=\"1\" y=\"16\" width=\"10\" height=\"4\" fill=\"#000000\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Segment e (lower left) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"6\" width=\"4\" height=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Segment f (upper left) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"4\" height=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Segment g (middle) -->\n  <rect x=\"1\" y=\"8\" width=\"10\" height=\"4\" fill=\"#000000\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Segment c (lower right) -->\n  <rect x=\"8\" y=\"6\" width=\"4\" height=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"/>\n</g>\n```\n\n### 5. Add Dirt\n```svg\n<g id=\"dirt\">\n  <!-- Bottom edge dust -->\n  <circle cx=\"10\" cy=\"55\" r=\"0.5\" fill=\"#E0E0E0\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"20\" cy=\"55\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#E0E0E0\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"30\" cy=\"55\" r=\"0.75\" fill=\"#E0E0E0\"/>\n  <!-- Segment dust (example on top-line 6) -->\n  <circle cx=\"12\" cy=\"12\" r=\"0.5\" fill=\"#E0E0E0\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"18\" cy=\"22\" r=\"0.5\" fill=\"#E0E0E0\"/>\n</g>\n```\n\n\n## 7. Final Notes for Accuracy\n- **Proportions**: Maintain the 5:3 bezel aspect ratio (width:height) and 3:5 seven-segment ratio.\n- **Alignment**: Ensure decimal points are horizontally aligned and text is centered.\n- **Textures**: Use subtle gradients for reflections and small circles for dirt to mimic real-world wear.\n- **Scaling**: The arbitrary unit system (100 units = bezel width) allows easy scaling (e.g., multiply all values by 10 for a 1000px-wide bezel).\n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. Adjust unit values as needed for your target size, but preserve the geometric and spatial relationships outlined above.",
  "v1_160": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a **comprehensive, technical description** of all visual elements, including geometric properties, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic details. The focus is on **reproducibility**, so measurements (where estimable), layer order, and texture cues are emphasized.\n\n\n## **1.

Colors & Textures**\nColors are described using **hex codes** (where possible) or Pantone equivalents for accuracy. Textures are noted to guide SVG styling (e.g., gradients for gloss, patterns for grain).\n\n| Object | Color Values | Texture & Visual Properties |\n|--------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Black Cutting Board** | `#1A1A1A` (matte black) | - Slightly textured (simulate with a subtle noise pattern). <br> - Scattered **sesame seeds**: `#F0E68C` (pale yellow), 1–2mm diameter, irregularly spaced (≈10 seeds total) around the container. |\n| **Glass Container** | - **Body**: `#FFFFFF` (clear) with 80% opacity (to show contents beneath). <br> - **Blue Rim**: `#4682B4` (steel blue), 100% opacity. | - Glass: Smooth, reflective (add a subtle linear gradient from `#E0E0E0` to `#FFFFFF` along the top edge for shine). <br> - Rim: Matte (no reflection). |\n| **Salmon Fillet** | - **Base**: `#DAA520` (golden brown) with a glossy finish. <br> - **Grill Marks**: `#8B4513` (saddle brown), 1mm thick. <br> - **Seasoning**: `#FFFFFF` (white, tiny specks for salt/pepper). | - Shiny, crispy skin (use a radial gradient from `#FFD700` (top) to `#DAA520` (bottom) for depth). <br> - Grill marks: Diagonal, uneven lines (add 10% opacity to blend with the base color). |\n| **Rice** | `#F5F5DC` (blanched almond) | - Fluffy, grainy texture (simulate with small, irregular white shapes (1–2mm) with 90% opacity). <br> - Some grains are translucent (add `#FFFFFF` highlights to 10% of grains). |\n| **Vegetables** | - **Yellow Bell Pepper**: `#FFD700` (gold) with `#8B0000` (dark red) char marks. <br> - **Orange Bell Pepper**: `#FFA500` (orange) with `#8B0000` char marks. <br> - **Onion**: `#E6E6FA` (lavender) with `#808080` (gray) translucency. | - Tender, slightly charred (add a 5% `#000000` overlay to edges for char). <br> - Onions: Semi-transparent (60% opacity) to show rice beneath. |\n| **Kitchen Knife** | - **Blade**: `#C0C0C0` (silver) with `#FFFFFF` (white) highlights. <br> - **Handle**: `#000000` (black) with `#808080` (gray) rivets. | - Blade: Polished stainless steel (add a linear gradient from `#FFFFFF` (top) to `#C0C0C0` (bottom) for shine). <br> - Handle: Matte black (no reflection); rivets: Raised (simulate with a small white dot in the center). |\n| **Background Items** | - **Red Lid**: `#FF0000` (red) with a `#8B0000` (dark red) rim. <br> - **Red Canister**: `#FF0000` (red) with a `#FFFFFF` (white) label. <br> - **Papers**: `#FFFFFF` (white) with `#000000` (black) text (faint, unreadable). | - Lid: Glossy (add a small white highlight dot). <br> - Canister: Matte (no reflection); label: 80% opacity. <br> - Papers: Slightly crumpled (add subtle curved lines for texture). |\n\n\n## **3. Spatial Relationships & Layer Order**\nThe **layer stack** (from bottom to top) is critical for SVG reproduction. Spatial relationships are described using **relative positioning** (e.g., \"to the right of,\" \"above\") and **alignment** (e.g., \"centered on the cutting board\").\n\n### **Layer Order (Bottom to Top)**\n1. **Countertop**: `#808080` (gray), matte, fills the background.  \n2. **Black Cutting Board**: Centered on the countertop, 1cm margin around edges.  \n3. **Glass Container**: Resting on the cutting board, **centered horizontally** (left/right) and **vertically aligned to the top 1/3 of the cutting board**.  \n4. **Rice**: Fills the bottom 2/3 of the container, layer below vegetables/fish.  \n5. **Vegetables**: Scattered on top of the rice, with 1/3 of their length protruding beyond the rice.  \n6. **Salmon Fillet**: Resting diagonally across the vegetables/rice (from the container’s **top-left corner** to **bottom-right corner**), covering ~70% of the container’s surface.  \n7. **Knife**: To the **right of the container**, blade pointing upward (tip aligned with the container’s top edge), handle resting on the cutting board. The blade overlaps the container’s right edge by ~2cm.  \n8. **Background Items**:  \n   - **Red Lid**: Behind the container, **top-left corner** of the cutting board (1cm margin from the cutting board’s top/left edges).  \n   - **Red Canister**: Behind the container, **top-right corner** of the cutting board (1cm margin from the cutting board’s top/right edges).  \n   - **White Papers**: Between the lid and canister, **centered horizontally** behind the container, slightly overlapping both.  \n9. **Sesame Seeds**: Scattered on the cutting board, **around the container** (top, bottom, left, right), layer above the cutting board but below the container.\n\n\n### **Key Positioning Details**\n- **Container**: The blue rim is aligned to the **top edge** of the glass body (no overlap).  \n- **Fish**: The fillet’s thickest part (center) is positioned over the container’s **vertical midline**. Grill marks run **diagonally** (30° from horizontal) across the fish.  \n- **Knife**: The blade’s left edge is 2cm to the right of the container’s right edge. The handle’s bottom end is 1cm from the cutting board’s right edge.  \n- **Sesame Seeds**: Clustered most densely **below the container** (6 seeds) and **to the right of the container** (3 seeds); 1 seed above the container.  \n\n\n## **4. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic, everyday scene** with warm, soft lighting (source: top-left) and subtle shadows. The focus is on the food, with background items slightly desaturated and out of focus (to draw attention to the container).\n\n### **Lighting & Shadows**\n- **Light Source**: Top-left (simulate with linear gradients from light to dark on objects).  \n- **Shadows**:  \n  - **Container**: Soft shadow (10% opacity, `#000000`) cast to the **bottom-right** of the container, 1cm wide.  \n  - **Fish**: Harder shadow (15% opacity, `#000000`) cast under the fillet onto the vegetables, shaped like the fish’s silhouette.  \n  - **Knife**: Thin shadow (5% opacity, `#000000`) cast to the left of the blade/handle.  \n- **Highlights**:  \n  - **Fish**: A small white highlight (`#FFFFFF`, 50% opacity) on the top-right edge of the fillet (simulates reflected light).  \n  - **Glass Container**: A linear gradient (`#FFFFFF` to `#E0E0E0`) along the top edge (simulates light reflecting off the glass).  \n\n\n## **5. Text, Symbols, & Specific Details**\n- **Red Canister**: Has a **white label** (`#FFFFFF`, 90% opacity) with **black text** (unreadable in the image, so use a placeholder like `#000000` with a \"noise\" pattern to simulate faint text).  \n- **White Papers**: Faint black text (use a **subtle line pattern** (1px thick, `#000000`, 10% opacity) to mimic printed text).  \n- **Fish Seasoning**: Tiny white specks (`#FFFFFF`, 1mm diameter) scattered on the fillet’s surface (10–15 specks total).  \n- **Vegetable Char Marks**: Small, irregular `#8B0000` (dark red) patches on the bell pepper strips (1–2 per strip) and onion edges (1 per strip).  \n\n\n## **6. SVG-Specific Notes for Reproduction**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following techniques in the SVG:  \n- **Glass Container**: Use a `<rect>` for the body (80% opacity) and a `<rect>` for the blue rim (100% opacity), aligned to the top edge. Add a **linear gradient** to the glass body for reflection.  \n- **Fish**: Use a `<path>` with a Bezier curve to create the fillet’s curved shape. Add grill marks as `<line>` elements (1mm thick) with 10% opacity.  \n- **Rice**: Use a `<g>` (group) of small `<circle>` or `<path>` elements (1–2mm) with 90% opacity, arranged in a \"clumped\" pattern.  \n- **Sesame Seeds**: Use `<circle>` elements (1–2mm diameter) with `#F0E68C` fill, scattered irregularly around the container.  \n- **Knife**: Use `<rect>` for the blade (with a pointed tip via a `<polygon>`) and `<rect>` for the handle. Add `<circle>` elements for rivets (3mm diameter) with `#808080` fill.  \n- **Shadows**: Use `<rect>` or `<path>` elements with `#000000` fill and 5–15% opacity, positioned to the bottom-right of objects.  \n\n\n## **7. Proportions & Measurements (Estimated)**\nFor scaling, use the **container** as a reference (15cm × 10cm × 2cm):  \n- **Cutting Board**: 25cm × 30cm (1.67× the container’s length/width).  \n- **Knife**: Blade 15cm long (same as the container’s length), handle 10cm long (2/3 of the blade length).  \n- **Red Lid**: 8cm diameter (53% of the container’s length).  \n- **Sesame Seeds**: 1–2mm diameter (1/10 of the container’s rim thickness).  \n\n\n## **Final SVG Structure**\nThe SVG should be organized into **layers/groups** for easy editing:  \n```xml\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 300 250\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Countertop (gray background) -->\n  <rect width=\"300\" height=\"250\" fill=\"#808080\" />\n  \n  <!-- Cutting Board (black, centered) -->\n  <rect x=\"25\" y=\"25\" width=\"250\" height=\"200\" fill=\"#1A1A1A\" />\n  \n  <!-- Sesame Seeds (scattered on cutting board) -->\n  <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"180\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#F0E68C\" />\n  <circle cx=\"70\" cy=\"190\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#F0E68C\" />\n  <!-- Add 8 more seeds -->\n  \n  <!-- Glass Container (clear with blue rim) -->\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"50\" width=\"220\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" opacity=\"0.8\" rx=\"5\" ry=\"5\" /> <!-- Body -->\n  <rect x=\"40\" y=\"50\" width=\"220\" height=\"2\" fill=\"#4682B4\" rx=\"5\" ry=\"5\" /> <!-- Blue Rim -->\n  \n  <!-- Rice (white, fluffy) -->\n  <g id=\"rice\">\n    <circle cx=\"60\" cy=\"120\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#F5F5DC\" opacity=\"0.9\" />\n    <circle cx=\"80\" cy=\"130\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#F5F5DC\" opacity=\"0.9\" />\n    <!-- Add 50+ more small shapes -->\n  </g>\n  \n  <!-- Vegetables (yellow/orange bell pepper, onion) -->\n  <g id=\"vegetables\">\n    <rect x=\"50\" y=\"80\" width=\"100\" height=\"5\" fill=\"#FFD700\" rx=\"2\" ry=\"2\" /> <!-- Yellow Pepper -->\n    <rect x=\"70\" y=\"90\" width=\"80\" height=\"5\" fill=\"#FFA500\" rx=\"2\" ry=\"2\" /> <!-- Orange Pepper -->\n    <path d=\"M100 100 Q110 105 120 100\" stroke=\"#E6E6FA\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" /> <!-- Onion -->\n    <!-- Add char marks as small <rect> elements -->\n  </g>\n  \n  <!-- Salmon Fillet (golden brown, grilled) -->\n  <path id=\"fish\" d=\"M50 60 Q100 70 200 140\" stroke=\"#DAA520\" stroke-width=\"15\" fill=\"#DAA520\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" /> <!-- Fillet Shape -->\n  <line x1=\"60\" y1=\"70\" x2=\"180\" y2=\"130\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"1\" opacity=\"0.1\" /> <!-- Grill Mark 1 -->\n  <line x1=\"70\" y1=\"75\" x2=\"190\" y2=\"135\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"1\" opacity=\"0.1\" /> <!-- Grill Mark 2 -->\n  \n  <!-- Knife (right of container) -->\n  <polygon points=\"240 50, 240 200, 290 190\" fill=\"#C0C0C0\" /> <!-- Blade (pointed tip) -->\n  <rect x=\"240\" y=\"200\" width=\"50\" height=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\" /> <!-- Handle -->\n  <circle cx=\"255\" cy=\"205\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#808080\" /> <!-- Rivet 1 -->\n  <circle cx=\"270\" cy=\"205\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#808080\" /> <!-- Rivet 2 -->\n  <circle cx=\"285\" cy=\"205\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#808080\" /> <!-- Rivet 3 -->\n  \n  <!-- Background Items (lid, canister, papers) -->\n  <circle cx=\"80\" cy=\"40\" r=\"40\" fill=\"#FF0000\" /> <!-- Red Lid -->\n  <rect x=\"180\" y=\"30\" width=\"50\" height=\"80\" fill=\"#FF0000\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" /> <!-- Red Canister -->\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"40\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" opacity=\"0.9\" /> <!-- White Papers -->\n</svg>\n```\n\n\nThis description provides all the technical details needed to recreate the image with precision. The SVG should prioritize **realism** (via gradients, shadows, and texture) while maintaining **editability** (via grouped elements and clear layer structure). Adjustments to proportions or colors can be made based on the final output size, but the spatial relationships and core shapes must remain consistent.",
  "v1_161": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here’s a detailed, structured description of its components, focusing on **geometric precision**, **proportions**, **colors**, **textures**, and **spatial relationships**:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **strawberry pie** in a clear glass dish, resting on a **wooden pie stand**. The background is a neutral countertop. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Pie**\n- **Base Crust**: A thick, fluted (wavy-edged) circle forming the pie’s perimeter. The fluted edge extends ~50px beyond the glass dish (see *Proportions* below).\n- **Lattice Top**: A grid of intersecting rectangular crust strips (horizontal + vertical) covering ~80% of the filling. The pattern alternates which strips are on top (e.g., horizontal strips overlay vertical strips in odd positions, and vice versa).\n- **Filling**: Chunks of strawberry (irregular polygons) submerged in glossy red juice, visible through gaps in the lattice.\n\n#### **Glass Dish**\n- A shallow, circular dish with a thin, raised edge. The dish is clear, so the bottom of the pie and stand slats are partially visible through it.\n\n#### **Wooden Stand**\n- **Base**: A rectangular block with rounded corners (10px radius) forming the stand’s foundation.\n- **Vertical Supports**: Two narrow rectangles (left/right) connecting the base to the slats.\n- **Slats**: Three horizontal rectangles (evenly spaced) supporting the glass dish.\n\n#### **Background**\n- A solid rectangle filling the entire image, with a vignetting effect (lighter center, darker edges) to draw attention to the pie.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are defined for vector reproduction (use hex codes or RGB values). Textures are simulated with **gradients** and **subtle patterns** (SVG-compatible).\n\n#### **Pie**\n- **Crust**:  \n  - **Base/Lattice**: Dominant color: `#D4A060` (light golden brown).  \n  - **Browning**: Darker accents (`#8B4513`) on lattice strip edges, fluted crust, and overlapping areas (simulates baking).  \n  - **Texture**: Flakiness is represented with **linear gradients** (light brown center → dark brown edges) on lattice strips and the fluted edge.  \n- **Filling**:  \n  - **Juice**: Deep red (`#CC0000`) with a glossy finish (see *Lighting* below).  \n  - **Strawberry Chunks**: Bright red (`#FF0000`) with irregular shapes. Some chunks have tiny black seeds (`#000000`) with white highlights (`#FFFFFF`) for depth.  \n\n#### **Glass Dish**\n- **Edge**: Thin stroke (`#CCCCCC`) to define the dish’s perimeter.  \n- **Transparency**: Subtle linear gradient (`#F0F0F0` → `#D0D0D0`) to simulate glass clarity. The dish’s bottom is partially obscured by the stand.  \n\n#### **Wooden Stand**\n- **Base/Supports/Slats**: Dominant color: `#D2B48C` (light tan).  \n- **Wood Grain**: Subtle diagonal lines (`#A0522D`) over a linear gradient (`#D2B48C` → `#B8860B`) to mimic natural wood texture.  \n\n#### **Background**\n- A solid rectangle with a **radial gradient** (center: `#E0E0E0`; edges: `#A0A0A0`) to create a vignetting effect (draws focus to the pie).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships & Proportions**\nUse the following **relative proportions** (based on a 1000px × 800px image) for alignment:\n\n| Element               | Dimensions (px)       | Position (Centered)       | Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Entire Image**      | 1000 (width) × 800 (height) | —                         | Background fills 100% of the canvas.                                  |\n| **Pie (Total Diameter)** | 700                   | (500, 400)                | Fluted edge extends beyond the dish (see *Dish* below).               |\n| **Glass Dish**        | 600 (diameter)        | (500, 400)                | Rests on the stand’s slats (see *Stand* below).                       |\n| **Stand Base**        | 800 (width) × 100     | (500, 750)                | Rounded corners (10px radius).                                       |\n| **Stand Vertical Supports** | 20 (width) × 200 (height) | Left: (100, 650); Right: (900, 650) | Connect base to slats.                                               |\n| **Stand Slats**       | 700 (length) × 20 (thickness) | Top: (500, 550); Middle: (500, 600); Bottom: (500, 650) | Three slats, evenly spaced (50px gap between them).                   |\n| **Lattice Strips**    | 50 (width) × 600 (length) | Horizontal/vertical grid  | 6 horizontal + 6 vertical strips. Gaps between strips = strip width (50px). |\n| **Fluted Edge**       | 16 evenly spaced “U” shapes | Around pie perimeter      | Each flute is a 22.5° segment (360°/16). See *Specific Details* below. |\n\n\n### **4. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is **realistic** but simplified for vector reproduction. Key stylistic choices:\n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Source**: Top-left (simulated with gradients).  \n  - **Crust**: Lighter left side (`#D4A060`), darker right side (`#8B4513`) to mimic shadows.  \n  - **Filling**: A radial gradient (`#FF3333` → `#CC0000`) in the top-left quadrant to simulate a glossy highlight (juice shine).  \n\n#### **Texture Simulation**\n- **Crust Flakiness**: Subtle curves in lattice strips (avoid perfect straight lines) and gradient fills (light center → dark edges) to mimic uneven baking.  \n- **Wood Grain**: Use a **pattern element** (SVG `<pattern>`) with thin, irregular diagonal lines (`#A0522D`) over the stand’s base/slats.  \n- **Filling Gloss**: A radial gradient on the filling layer (center: `#FF3333`; edges: `#CC0000`) to make the juice look wet.  \n\n#### **Irregularity**\n- **Strawberry Chunks**: Draw as irregular polygons (not perfect circles/squares) to mimic real fruit.  \n- **Lattice Strips**: Add slight horizontal/vertical curves to avoid a “machine-made” look.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Critical for Accuracy)**\nThese details are essential for recreating the image’s character:\n\n#### **Lattice Top Pattern**\n- **Overlay Order**: Alternate which strips are on top (e.g., horizontal strip 1 overlays vertical strip 1; vertical strip 2 overlays horizontal strip 2; repeat).  \n- **Gaps**: The space between strips = strip width (50px). Ensure strawberry chunks are visible through these gaps (see *Filling* below).  \n\n#### **Fluted Crust Edge**\n- **Shape**: Each flute is a “U” shape (bottom of the U at the pie’s edge, sides curving inward).  \n- **Count**: 16 flutes (evenly spaced, 22.5° apart).  \n- **Thickness**: The fluted edge is ~20px thicker than the lattice strips (to emphasize the pie’s perimeter).  \n\n#### **Strawberry Filling**\n- **Chunk Placement**: Position 8–10 irregular strawberry chunks in the lattice gaps. Use varying sizes (50px–100px) for realism.  \n- **Seeds**: Add 3–5 tiny black dots (`#000000`) with a 1px white highlight (`#FFFFFF`) to 2–3 chunks (simulates strawberry seeds).  \n\n#### **Glass Dish**\n- **Edge Visibility**: The dish’s edge is slightly raised (~5px) above the pie crust. Use a thin stroke (`#CCCCCC`) to define this edge.  \n- **Transparency**: The dish should be partially see-through—ensure the stand’s slats are visible through the bottom of the dish.  \n\n#### **Wooden Stand**\n- **Slat Spacing**: The three slats are evenly spaced (50px gap between them). The middle slat aligns with the vertical center of the glass dish.  \n- **Base Corners**: Round the base’s corners (10px radius) to mimic a handcrafted stand.  \n\n\n### **6. SVG Layer Order (Bottom to Top)**\nTo ensure correct visibility (e.g., the stand obscures the dish’s bottom), use this layer stack:  \n1. **Background** (solid rectangle with radial gradient)  \n2. **Stand Base** (rounded rectangle)  \n3. **Stand Vertical Supports** (left/right rectangles)  \n4. **Stand Slats** (three horizontal rectangles)  \n5. **Glass Dish** (circle with thin stroke + gradient)  \n6. **Pie Filling** (circle with radial gradient + strawberry chunks)  \n7. **Pie Base Crust** (fluted circle)  \n8. **Pie Lattice Top** (grid of rectangles, alternating overlay order)  \n9. **Filling Highlight** (radial gradient in top-left quadrant, set to `opacity: 0.5` for subtlety)  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key SVG Parameters**\n| Element               | Key SVG Properties                                  |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Pie Lattice**       | `<rect>` elements (50px × 600px), alternating `z-index` for overlay. |\n| **Fluted Crust**      | `<path>` element with 16 “U” shapes (use `d` attribute for curves). |\n| **Wood Grain**        | `<pattern>` element with thin diagonal lines, applied to stand via `fill=\"url(#wood-grain)\"`. |\n| **Filling Highlight** | `<radialGradient>` element (center: `(0.25, 0.25)`; radius: `0.5`), applied to a `<circle>` clipped to the filling area. |\n\n\n### **Example SVG Snippets (For Reference)**\n#### **Fluted Crust Path**\n```svg\n<path d=\"M 350 400 Q 360 380 370 400 Q 380 380 390 400 ...\" \n      fill=\"#D4A060\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n<!-- Repeat 16 times for a full circle; adjust control points to create \"U\" shapes. -->\n```\n\n#### **Wood Grain Pattern**\n```svg\n<pattern id=\"wood-grain\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"20\" y2=\"20\" stroke=\"#A0522D\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"5\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"25\" y2=\"20\" stroke=\"#A0522D\" stroke-width=\"1\" opacity=\"0.5\"/>\n</pattern>\n\n<!-- Apply to stand base: -->\n<rect x=\"100\" y=\"700\" width=\"800\" height=\"100\" rx=\"10\" \n      fill=\"url(#wood-grain)\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n```\n\n\nBy following this description, you can recreate a faithful SVG version of the image, with all the details that give it its realistic, inviting character. Adjust proportions as needed for your canvas size, but keep the **relative ratios** (e.g., lattice strip width = gap width) consistent for accuracy.",
  "v1_162": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, we’ll break down the composition into **geometric shapes**, **textures**, **color gradients**, and **spatial relationships**, focusing on the key elements: fried egg rolls, a paper towel base, and a wooden background. Below is a detailed, technical description tailored for vector graphics.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a close-up of **8–10 hand-fried egg rolls** piled irregularly on a **white paper towel**, with a **wooden surface** visible on the left edge. The composition is centered on the egg rolls, which dominate 70% of the frame.\n\n#### **Egg Rolls**\n- **Primary Shape**: Each egg roll is a **long, cylindrical rectangle** with rounded ends, roughly 100mm (4 inches) long and 20mm (0.8 inches) in diameter (relative to a 150mm-wide image). The shape is slightly curved (due to frying) and features **folded wrapper edges** at both ends (a \"lip\" where the dough is sealed).\n- **Quantity & Arrangement**: 8–10 egg rolls are stacked in a loose, overlapping pile. The topmost roll is centered; others fan out to the left/right and below, creating depth via layering.\n- **Key Details**: \n  - **Folded Ends**: Small triangular/curved \"flaps\" at each end (10–15mm wide) to mimic the wrapper seal.\n  - **Surface Texture**: 50–100 **irregularly spaced bubbles** (1–2mm diameter) and **dark fried patches** (irregular blobs) on the exterior.\n\n#### **Paper Towel**\n- **Shape**: A large, slightly folded rectangle covering the bottom 2/3 of the image. The left edge is folded over the wooden surface; the right edge is straight but mildly ragged.\n- **Function**: Serves as a base for the egg rolls, with subtle absorbent texture.\n\n#### **Wooden Surface**\n- **Shape**: A rectangular strip on the **left 1/3 of the image** (visible behind the paper towel and egg rolls).\n- **Key Detail**: **Natural wood grain** (diagonal lines) to mimic a cutting board or tabletop.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is warm and earthy, with high contrast between the crispy egg rolls and the soft background. Textures are critical for realism (e.g., bubbly fried dough, absorbent paper, wood grain).\n\n#### **Egg Rolls**\n- **Base Color**: Gradient from **#d2a679** (light golden-brown) to **#b58352** (medium brown) to simulate depth.\n- **Highlights**: Thin, curved paths along the **top edge** of each roll, filled with **#f8d7a8** (pale yellow) and a 50% transparency gradient (light to transparent) for a glossy, fried sheen.\n- **Bubbles**: 1–2mm circles filled with **#f0c88e** (pale golden) and a 20% stroke of **#e0b87e** (to make them pop). Scattered randomly, with more concentration on the **top half** of each roll (where oil bubbles rise).\n- **Fried Spots**: Irregular blobs (10–20mm wide) filled with **#8b4513** (dark brown) at 30–50% opacity. Placed on the **sides and top** of the rolls (areas exposed to direct heat).\n- **Shadows**: Copy of the egg roll path, filled with **#654321** (dark brown), translated **2–3px down/right**, and blurred (2px Gaussian) to simulate cast shadows.\n\n#### **Paper Towel**\n- **Base Color**: **#f5f5f5** (off-white) with a 10% transparency gradient (lighter in the center, darker at edges) to mimic soft lighting.\n- **Texture**: A **pattern of small dots** (0.5mm diameter, **#e0e0e0**) repeated every 10mm. Applied at 30% opacity to simulate absorbent paper.\n- **Folded Edge**: A subtle curve on the left edge (10mm radius) to show the paper towel overlapping the wooden surface.\n\n#### **Wooden Surface**\n- **Base Color**: **#a07852** (warm medium brown) with a 15% transparency gradient (darker on the left, lighter on the right) to match the lighting.\n- **Grain Texture**: 50–100 **thin diagonal lines** (0.5–1px width) from **#8b5e3c** (dark brown) to **#9e7248** (medium brown). Lines are angled 45° (top-left to bottom-right) and spaced randomly (5–20mm apart) to mimic natural grain.\n- **Edge Detail**: A 1mm stroke of **#704d28** (dark brown) along the right edge (where the wood meets the paper towel) to add definition.\n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Direction**: Warm, soft light from the **top-left**, creating:\n  - **Highlights**: On the top of the egg rolls (light golden) and the wooden surface (pale brown).\n  - **Shadows**: Under the egg rolls (dark brown, blurred) and along the paper towel’s left fold (soft gray).\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centered on the egg rolls**, with depth created via layering. Below is a breakdown of z-order (from back to front) and relative positioning:\n\n| Layer | Object | Position | Z-Order |\n|-------|--------|----------|---------|\n| 1     | Wooden Surface | Left 1/3 of the image (x: 0–150mm, y: 0–150mm) | Background |\n| 2     | Paper Towel | Covers bottom 2/3 of the image (x: 20–150mm, y: 50–150mm) | Middle |\n| 3     | Egg Roll Shadows | Translated 2–3mm down/right from each egg roll | Under Egg Rolls |\n| 4     | Egg Rolls | Piled in the center (x: 30–120mm, y: 30–120mm) | Foreground |\n| 5     | Egg Roll Highlights/Bubbles | Overlaid on each egg roll | Top |\n\n#### **Egg Roll Layering**\n- **Topmost Roll**: Centered (x: 50–100mm, y: 30–50mm), slightly curved.\n- **Middle Rolls**: 3–4 rolls fanning out to the left/right (x: 20–130mm, y: 50–100mm), overlapping the top roll.\n- **Bottom Rolls**: 2–3 rolls along the bottom edge (x: 40–110mm, y: 100–120mm), partially hidden by the paper towel.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph**, but the SVG must simplify details while retaining authenticity. Key style choices for vector reproduction:\n\n- **Irregularity**: No two egg rolls are identical—vary curvature, bubble placement, and fried patches to avoid \"machine-made\" uniformity.\n- **Subtle Textures**: Use **patterns** (paper towel dots, wood grain lines) and **filters** (blur for shadows) instead of raster images.\n- **Gradient Fills**: For egg rolls and wood, use linear/radial gradients to add depth (e.g., darker at the bottom of egg rolls, lighter on the wooden surface).\n- **Low Opacity**: For fried patches and paper towel texture, use 30–50% opacity to blend with the base color.\n\n\n### **5. Technical Specifications for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following **viewbox**, **units**, and **elements** in your SVG:\n\n#### **Viewbox**\nDefine a 150mm × 150mm viewbox (common for close-up food shots):  \n`<svg viewBox=\"0 0 150 150\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">`\n\n#### **Egg Roll Path Example**\nEach egg roll is a **closed Bézier curve** to capture its curved shape and folded ends. Below is a sample path for a topmost egg roll:  \n```svg\n<path id=\"egg1\" d=\"M50 30 Q60 25 70 30 Q80 35 90 30 Q100 25 110 30 Q120 35 130 30 Q125 40 115 45 Q105 50 95 45 Q85 40 75 45 Q65 50 55 45 Q45 40 50 30\" fill=\"url(#egg-gradient)\" stroke=\"#654321\" stroke-width=\"0.5\"/>\n```\n- **Explanation**: The `Q` commands create a wavy, cylindrical shape; the final `Q` closes the path and adds a folded end.\n\n#### **Gradients**\nDefine gradients for the egg rolls and wooden surface:  \n```svg\n<!-- Egg Roll Base Gradient (golden-brown to medium brown) -->\n<linearGradient id=\"egg-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#d2a679\"/>\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#b58352\"/>\n</linearGradient>\n\n<!-- Wooden Surface Gradient (medium brown to dark brown) -->\n<linearGradient id=\"wood-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"0\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#a07852\"/>\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#704d28\"/>\n</linearGradient>\n```\n\n#### **Filters**\nUse a Gaussian blur for egg roll shadows:  \n```svg\n<filter id=\"shadow-blur\">\n  <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceGraphic\" stdDeviation=\"2\"/>\n</filter>\n```\n\n#### **Patterns**\nDefine a pattern for the paper towel’s absorbent texture:  \n```svg\n<pattern id=\"paper-texture\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n  <circle cx=\"5\" cy=\"5\" r=\"0.5\" fill=\"#e0e0e0\"/>\n</pattern>\n```\n\n#### **Example Egg Roll Code**\n```svg\n<!-- Egg Roll Shadow (Layer 3) -->\n<path d=\"M50 30 Q60 25 70 30 Q80 35 90 30 Q100 25 110 30 Q120 35 130 30 Q125 40 115 45 Q105 50 95 45 Q85 40 75 45 Q65 50 55 45 Q45 40 50 30\" fill=\"#654321\" filter=\"url(#shadow-blur)\"/>\n\n<!-- Egg Roll Base (Layer 4) -->\n<path id=\"egg1\" d=\"M50 30 Q60 25 70 30 Q80 35 90 30 Q100 25 110 30 Q120 35 130 30 Q125 40 115 45 Q105 50 95 45 Q85 40 75 45 Q65 50 55 45 Q45 40 50 30\" fill=\"url(#egg-gradient)\" stroke=\"#654321\" stroke-width=\"0.5\"/>\n\n<!-- Egg Roll Bubbles (Layer 5) -->\n<circle cx=\"60\" cy=\"35\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#f0c88e\" stroke=\"#e0b87e\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n<circle cx=\"80\" cy=\"40\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#f0c88e\" stroke=\"#e0b87e\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n<circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"38\" r=\"2\" fill=\"#f0c88e\" stroke=\"#e0b87e\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n\n<!-- Egg Roll Fried Patch (Layer 5) -->\n<path d=\"M70 42 Q75 45 80 42 Q75 39 70 42\" fill=\"#8b4513\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n```\n\n\n### **4. Critical Notes for Reproduction**\n- **Irregularity**: Avoid perfect circles for bubbles or straight lines for egg rolls—use randomness to mimic hand-made/fried food.\n- **Blur**: Apply the `shadow-blur` filter only to the shadow layers (not the egg rolls themselves) to keep the crispy texture sharp.\n- **Grain**: For the wooden surface, use 50–100 thin lines (not a single pattern) to avoid a \"repeat\" effect.\n- **Highlights**: Keep highlight paths thin (1–2mm) and limited to the top edge of each egg roll—overdoing them will make the rolls look artificial.\n\n\n### **Final SVG Structure**\n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 150 150\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Gradients -->\n  <linearGradient id=\"egg-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#d2a679\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#b58352\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n  <linearGradient id=\"wood-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"0\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#a07852\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#704d28\"/>\n  </linearGradient>\n\n  <!-- Filters -->\n  <filter id=\"shadow-blur\">\n    <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceGraphic\" stdDeviation=\"2\"/>\n  </filter>\n\n  <!-- Patterns -->\n  <pattern id=\"paper-texture\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n    <circle cx=\"5\" cy=\"5\" r=\"0.5\" fill=\"#e0e0e0\"/>\n  </pattern>\n\n  <!-- Wooden Surface (Background) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" fill=\"url(#wood-gradient)\"/>\n  <line x1=\"10\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"150\" stroke=\"#8b5e3c\" stroke-width=\"0.5\"/>\n  <line x1=\"30\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"70\" y2=\"150\" stroke=\"#8b5e3c\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"50\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"90\" y2=\"150\" stroke=\"#8b5e3c\" stroke-width=\"0.75\"/>\n  <!-- Add 47+ more grain lines -->\n\n  <!-- Paper Towel (Middle Layer) -->\n  <rect x=\"20\" y=\"50\" width=\"130\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#f5f5f5\"/>\n  <rect x=\"20\" y=\"50\" width=\"130\" height=\"100\" fill=\"url(#paper-texture)\" opacity=\"0.3\"/>\n\n  <!-- Egg Roll Shadows (Under Egg Rolls) -->\n  <path d=\"M50 30 Q60 25 70 30 Q80 35 90 30 Q100 25 110 30 Q120 35 130 30 Q125 40 115 45 Q105 50 95 45 Q85 40 75 45 Q65 50 55 45 Q45 40 50 30\" fill=\"#654321\" filter=\"url(#shadow-blur)\"/>\n  <!-- Add shadows for 7+ more egg rolls -->\n\n  <!-- Egg Rolls (Foreground) -->\n  <path id=\"egg1\" d=\"M50 30 Q60 25 70 30 Q80 35 90 30 Q100 25 110 30 Q120 35 130 30 Q125 40 115 45 Q105 50 95 45 Q85 40 75 45 Q65 50 55 45 Q45 40 50 30\" fill=\"url(#egg-gradient)\" stroke=\"#654321\" stroke-width=\"0.5\"/>\n  <!-- Add 7+ more egg roll paths -->\n\n  <!-- Egg Roll Details (Top Layer) -->\n  <circle cx=\"60\" cy=\"35\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#f0c88e\" stroke=\"#e0b87e\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"80\" cy=\"40\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#f0c88e\" stroke=\"#e0b87e\" stroke-width=\"0.2\"/>\n  <path d=\"M70 42 Q75 45 80 42 Q75 39 70 42\" fill=\"#8b4513\" opacity=\"0.4\"/>\n  <!-- Add bubbles/fried patches to all egg rolls -->\n</svg>\n```\n\n\nThis description provides all the technical details needed to recreate the image as a realistic, vector-based SVG. The key is to balance **precision** (e.g., gradient directions, shadow placement) with **randomness** (e.g., bubble positions, grain lines) to capture the organic nature of the subject.",
  "v1_163": "To create an accurate SVG recreation of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties with a focus on geometric precision, proportional relationships, and textural cues necessary for vector reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image features **7 fully visible and 2 partial chocolate-coated treats** (likely cookies or candies) arranged on a **metallic baking sheet**. The primary shapes are:  \n- **Treats**: Round, flat-topped disks with a slightly raised, thicker edge (suggesting a chocolate coating over a base, e.g., a cookie). Each is a perfect circle with a diameter ranging from **2.0–3.0 units** (relative scale, with the largest treat in the center front as the reference).  \n- **Baking Sheet**: A large rectangular plane filling the background, extending beyond the frame (partial view).  \n- **Sprinkles**: Three types of decorative toppings on the treats:  \n  - **Round dots**: Red (#FF0000), white (#FFFFFF), green (#008000).  \n  - **Thin sticks**: Red (#FF0000), green (#008000) (1:6 length-to-width ratio).  \n  - **Christmas trees**: Green (#008000) (simple polygon with a triangular top and a short rectangular trunk).  \n\nAdditional elements: **Scattered crumbs** (tiny red, green, and white dots) on the baking sheet, and **subtle shadows** beneath each treat.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Chocolate Coating**  \n- **Color**: Deep brown (#4B280F) with a glossy finish. Use a **linear gradient** (light source from the **top-left**) for depth:  \n  - Light brown (#8B4513) at the top-left edge (highlights).  \n  - Dark brown (#4B280F) at the bottom-right edge (shadows).  \n- **Texture**: Smooth, with a slight reflection. Add a **small oval highlight** (white #FFFFFF, 30% opacity) in the top-left quadrant of each treat to mimic gloss.  \n\n#### **Sprinkles**  \n- **Round dots**: Matte finish, solid colors (red, white, green).  \n- **Sticks**: Matte finish, solid colors (red, green).  \n- **Christmas trees**: Matte finish, solid green (#008000).  \n\n#### **Baking Sheet**  \n- **Color**: Metallic gray (#808080) with a cool undertone. Use a **radial gradient** for dimension:  \n  - Light gray (#A9A9A9) at the center (catch light).  \n  - Dark gray (#696969) at the edges (shadow).  \n- **Texture**: Grainy, with a subtle repeating pattern of **small irregular dots** (1–2px in size, varying shades of gray) to mimic metallic grain. Add **random crumbs** (red, green, white dots, 0.1 units in diameter) for realism.  \n\n#### **Shadows**  \n- **Color**: Translucent black (#000000, 20% opacity).  \n- **Shape**: Ellipse (slightly flattened) beneath each treat, offset **0.2 units to the right** (consistent with top-left light source).  \n- **Size**: 80% of the treat’s diameter (to suggest depth).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe baking sheet fills the entire SVG canvas (assumed to be a **10x10 unit rectangle** for proportionality). Treats are arranged in a **loose, random pattern** with slight overlaps (e.g., the center-front treat overlaps the left treat by 0.3 units). Key positioning:  \n\n| Treat Position       | Diameter (Units) | Sprinkle Type               | Relative Placement          |\n|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Center Front**     | 3.0              | Green Christmas trees       | Focal point (center of canvas) |\n| **Left of Center**   | 2.5              | Red/white/green round dots  | 1.5 units left of center    |\n| **Right of Center**  | 2.5              | Red/green sticks + round dots | 1.5 units right of center |\n| **Top Left**         | 2.0              | Red sticks + round dots     | 2.0 units up, 2.0 units left |\n| **Top Center**       | 2.2              | Red/green sticks + round dots | 2.5 units up, center       |\n| **Top Right**        | 2.3              | Red/white/green round dots  | 2.0 units up, 2.5 units right |\n| **Bottom Right**     | 2.0 (partial)    | Plain chocolate (no sprinkles) | Cut off by bottom-right edge |\n\n#### **Overlap Rules**  \n- The center-front treat is the **foreground element** (no overlaps from other treats).  \n- The left/right center treats overlap the top center treat by 0.2 units.  \n- The top left/right treats are in the **background** (overlapped by no other elements).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Genre**: Realistic still life (homemade festive treats).  \n- **Mood**: Casual, warm, and festive (emphasized by Christmas tree sprinkles).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the **top-left**, creating consistent shadows and highlights.  \n- **Composition**: Balanced, with the largest treat (center front) drawing the eye. Partial treats at the edges (bottom right, top left) suggest the baking sheet extends beyond the frame.  \n- **Vector Adaptation**: Translate photographic realism into clean vectors by simplifying textures (e.g., using gradients for gloss instead of photo textures) and maintaining geometric precision (e.g., perfect circles for treats, uniform sprinkle shapes).  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**\n#### **Treat Edges**  \nEach treat has a **slightly raised edge** (thicker chocolate coating). Represent this with a **inner circle** (0.1 units smaller than the main circle) filled with a **darker brown** (#381E08) to create a \"rim\" effect.  \n\n#### **Sprinkle Distribution**  \n- **Center Front Treat**: 15–20 green Christmas trees (randomly placed, no overlap limit).  \n- **Left of Center Treat**: 25–30 round dots (60% green, 25% red, 15% white; no sticks/trees).  \n- **Right of Center Treat**: 18–22 elements (40% sticks, 60% round dots; 50% green, 30% red, 20% white).  \n- **Top Left Treat**: 12–15 elements (70% red sticks, 30% red round dots).  \n- **Top Center Treat**: 20–25 elements (50% sticks, 50% round dots; 40% green, 30% red, 30% white).  \n- **Top Right Treat**: 20–25 round dots (50% green, 30% red, 20% white).  \n\n#### **Crumb Placement**  \nAdd **5–10 crumbs** (red, green, white) on the baking sheet, concentrated near treat edges (e.g., 0.5 units from the center-front treat).  \n\n#### **Gloss Highlights**  \nEach treat has a **0.5x0.3 unit oval highlight** (white, 30% opacity) in the **top-left quadrant** (aligned with the light source).  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric Precision for SVG**\n- **Treats**: Draw as **circles** with a **darker inner circle** (rim) and a **gradient fill** (gloss).  \n- **Sprinkles**:  \n  - Round dots: Circles (0.1 units diameter).  \n  - Sticks: Rectangles (0.3 units long, 0.05 units wide).  \n  - Trees: Polygons (triangle with a 0.15 unit base, 0.2 unit height + 0.05 unit trunk).  \n- **Baking Sheet**: Rectangle (10x10 units) with a radial gradient and dot pattern.  \n- **Shadows**: Ellipses (flattened, 0.8x0.6 units for a 3-unit treat) with translucent fill.  \n\n#### **Proportional Guidelines**  \n- Use a **10x10 unit canvas** (e.g., 1000x1000px) for scalability.  \n- Treat diameters: 2.0–3.0 units (e.g., 200–300px).  \n- Sprinkles: 0.1–0.3 units (e.g., 10–30px) to maintain visibility.  \n- Shadows: 0.2 units offset (e.g., 20px) to suggest depth.  \n\n\n### **7. Key Artistic Notes for SVG**\n- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform shadow direction (right offset) and light source (top-left) for realism.  \n- **Simplification**: Avoid overcrowding sprinkles (max 30 per treat) to keep the design clean.  \n- **Textures**: Use vector patterns (e.g., baking sheet grain) instead of raster images for scalability.  \n- **Festive Theme**: Emphasize Christmas tree sprinkles (center-front treat) as a focal point to reinforce the holiday vibe.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details for a precise SVG recreation, including geometric shapes, color gradients, texture patterns, and spatial relationships. The focus on proportionality and consistency ensures the final vector will match the photographic reference while retaining scalability and clarity.",
  "v1_164": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties with precision for geometric and stylistic fidelity:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image features a **piled arrangement of cooked vegetables** (broccoli florets and carrot slices) on a **rectangular white plate**, set against a plain white background. Key elements include:  \n- **Broccoli Florets**: Irregular, tree-like structures with:  \n  - **Stalks**: Cylindrical, tapering slightly (1–2 cm long), often angled diagonally or vertically.  \n  - **Heads**: Multiple branching \"florets\" with jagged, irregular edges (0.5–3 cm in diameter). The largest floret is centered at the bottom of the pile.  \n- **Carrot Slices**: Thin, elongated ovals (oblongs) with rounded ends, cut diagonally (2–3 cm long, 0.5–1 cm wide). Some slices are whole; others are broken into smaller segments.  \n- **Glossy Sauce**: A thin, viscous coating covering all vegetables, with visible specks of green (likely herb or broccoli residue).  \n- **Plate**: A rectangular ceramic plate with a beveled edge (top surface flat, sides angled downward). Corners are slightly rounded.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Plate**  \n- **Base Color**: Bright white (#FFFFFF) for the top surface.  \n- **Edge**: Light gray (#E0E0E0) for the beveled sides, adding depth.  \n- **Texture**: Smooth, matte finish (solid fill with subtle gradient for dimensionality).  \n\n#### **Broccoli**  \n- **Floret Tips**: Dark green (#2E8B57) with a bumpy, textured surface (simulate with small, irregular circles or noise).  \n- **Stalks/Inner Florets**: Light green (#66CDAA) to yellow-green (#90EE90), with a smoother texture than the tips.  \n- **Highlights**: Pale green (#B2FF66) on the upper edges of florets, from a top-left light source.  \n\n#### **Carrots**  \n- **Base Color**: Vibrant orange (#FFA500) with a smooth, glossy surface.  \n- **Highlights**: Bright orange (#FFD700) on the top-left of each slice (direct light reflection).  \n- **Shadows**: Dark orange (#FF8C00) on the bottom-right of slices (cast by adjacent vegetables).  \n- **Specks**: Tiny green dots (#32CD32) from the sauce, scattered randomly.  \n\n#### **Sauce**  \n- **Base Color**: Pale greenish-yellow (#E6F9E6), transparent to allow underlying vegetable colors to show through.  \n- **Gloss**: Radial gradients (white #FFFFFF at the center, fading to sauce color) on the highest points of vegetables (e.g., carrot tops, broccoli tips) to simulate wetness.  \n- **Specks**: Small green (#32CD32) and yellow (#FFFF99) dots, 1–2 pixels in size, distributed across all surfaces.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n#### **Plate**  \n- **Layout**: Centered in the image, slightly tilted (top edge wider than the bottom, creating a 10–15° angle from horizontal).  \n- **Dimensions**: Approximate ratio of 3:2 (width:height) — e.g., 150mm wide × 100mm tall in real life (scale as needed for SVG).  \n- **Vegetable Coverage**: Occupies 80–90% of the plate’s surface, with edges of broccoli/carrots extending to the plate’s perimeter.  \n\n#### **Vegetables**  \n- **Pile Structure**: Mounded in the center, with:  \n  - **Broccoli**: Dominates the bottom, left, and right edges (large florets at the bottom center, smaller ones around the perimeter).  \n  - **Carrots**: Concentrated in the upper half and middle, interspersed with broccoli. Some slices lie flat; others are slightly tilted.  \n- **Overlapping**: Carrots are often on top of broccoli (e.g., a large carrot slice in the middle-top overlaps a broccoli floret). Broccoli stalks weave between carrot slices.  \n- **Depth**: Foreground elements (e.g., bottom-center broccoli) are larger and more detailed; background elements (e.g., top-left carrots) are smaller and slightly desaturated.  \n\n#### **Lighting**  \n- **Source**: Soft, diffused light from the **top-left**, creating:  \n  - Bright highlights on carrot tops and broccoli tips.  \n  - Subtle shadows on the bottom-right of vegetables and the plate’s lower edge.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The image is highly realistic, with natural textures (broccoli’s bumpy florets, carrot’s smooth gloss) and lighting.  \n- **Focus**: The plain white background draws attention to the vegetables, which are the focal point.  \n- **Texture Contrast**: Rough broccoli vs. smooth carrots vs. matte plate creates visual interest.  \n- **Depth**: Achieved through overlapping vegetables, shadow gradients, and the plate’s beveled edge.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Broccoli Florets**: Use **irregular polygons** for the main head, with smaller polygons attached as \"branches.\" Stalks are rectangles with rounded ends, tapered slightly.  \n- **Carrot Slices**: Use **ellipses** (oblongs) with minor adjustments for irregular edges (e.g., slight indentations on one side).  \n- **Sauce**: Apply a **translucent fill** to all vegetable shapes, with **radial gradients** for highlights. Add **small circles** (1–2px) for specks.  \n- **Plate**: Draw the top surface as a **rectangle** with rounded corners, then a smaller rectangle below for the beveled edge (angled to match the plate’s tilt).  \n- **Lighting**: Use **linear gradients** for shadows (darkest on the bottom-right of objects) and **radial gradients** for highlights (brightest on the top-left).  \n- **Overlapping**: Arrange layers from **background to foreground**: Plate → Broccoli (bottom layer) → Carrots (middle layer) → Broccoli (top layer) → Sauce highlights.  \n\n#### **Proportions**  \n- **Plate**: 80% of the image width (e.g., 800px wide × 533px tall for a 1200px image).  \n- **Vegetables**: Largest broccoli floret = 15% of plate width (120px); largest carrot slice = 10% of plate width (80px).  \n- **Sauce Specks**: 1–2px in diameter, spaced 5–10px apart.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Workflow**\n1. **Draw the Plate**: Rectangle with rounded corners, add beveled edge using a smaller rectangle below.  \n2. **Add Broccoli**: Draw stalks (tapered rectangles) and florets (irregular polygons), apply green gradients and texture.  \n3. **Add Carrots**: Draw oblong ellipses, apply orange gradients and irregular edges.  \n4. **Apply Sauce**: Add translucent fill to all vegetables, add radial highlights and specks.  \n5. **Adjust Lighting**: Add shadow gradients to vegetables and plate, ensure highlights are consistent with top-left light.  \n6. **Arrange Layers**: Order from plate (bottom) to sauce highlights (top), ensuring overlapping looks natural.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s realism, color, and composition.",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n#### **Plate**\n- **Placement**: Centered slightly to the right of the image, resting on the wooden table.\n- **Margins**: The plate’s left edge is ~5 cm from the image’s left border; the bottom edge is ~3 cm from the image’s bottom border.\n\n#### **Sushi Rolls**\n- **Arrangement**: Clustered in a diagonal line from the **top-left corner of the plate** to the **bottom-right corner**, with slight overlapping (≈0.5 cm overlap between adjacent pieces).\n- **Positioning**:\n  - **Top-left piece**: 3 cm from the plate’s left edge, 2 cm from the plate’s top edge.\n  - **Subsequent pieces**: Shifted 2 cm to the right and 1 cm down from the previous piece (e.g., second piece: 5 cm left, 3 cm top; third piece: 7 cm left, 4 cm top; etc.).\n  - **Bottom-right piece**: 17 cm from the plate’s left edge, 10 cm from the plate’s top edge.\n- **Layer Order**: Sushi pieces are stacked slightly, with the leftmost pieces appearing in the foreground (higher z-index) and rightmost in the background.\n\n#### **Bowl**\n- **Placement**: Bottom-left corner of the plate, 2 cm from the plate’s left edge and 2 cm from the plate’s bottom edge.\n- **Layer Order**: Resting on the plate (lower z-index than sushi pieces).\n\n#### **Lighting and Shadows**\n- **Light Source**: Top-left (simulated by gradients and shadows).\n- **Shadows**:\n  - **Plate**: Soft dark gray (#696969) shadow to the bottom-right of the plate, slightly larger than the plate (blur radius ≈1 cm).\n  - **Sushi Rolls**: Small dark gray (#808080) shadows to the bottom-right of each piece (radius ≈0.3 cm, blur radius ≈0.1 cm).\n  - **Bowl**: Small dark gray (#808080) shadow to the bottom-right of the bowl (radius ≈1 cm, blur radius ≈0.2 cm).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The image is a realistic photograph, but the SVG should prioritize **clean vector lines** and **subtle textures** to maintain clarity.\n- **Lighting**: Soft directional light from the top-left creates gentle gradients (e.g., plate is lighter on the left, darker on the right) and subtle shadows (no harsh edges).\n- **Composition**: Balanced layout with the sushi cluster (right) and bowl (left) creating visual harmony. The diagonal arrangement of sushi guides the viewer’s eye across the plate.\n\n\n### **5. Geometric Details and Proportions**\nFor SVG, use **relative units** (e.g., 1 unit = 1 cm) for consistency. Below are key measurements:\n\n#### **Plate**\n- **Length (horizontal)**: 20 units.\n- **Width (vertical)**: 12 units.\n- **Corner Radius**: 1 unit.\n\n#### **Bowl**\n- **Diameter**: 5 units (radius = 2.5 units).\n- **Placement**: 2 units from the plate’s left edge, 2 units from the plate’s bottom edge.\n\n#### **Sushi Rolls**\n- **Diameter**: 3 units (radius = 1.5 units).\n- **Layer Thickness**:\n  - **Nori**: 0.1 units (outer circle radius = 1.5 units).\n  - **Rice**: 1.4 units (middle circle radius = 1.5 – 0.1 units).\n  - **Fillings**: Confined to the inner 1.4 units (e.g., a cream cheese strip might be 0.5 units wide, centered in the rice layer).\n\n#### **Shadows**\n- **Plate Shadow**: Rectangle with rounded corners, 21 units × 13 units (1 unit larger than the plate), placed 1 unit to the right and 1 unit down from the plate.\n- **Sushi Shadow**: Circle with radius = 1.6 units (0.1 units larger than the sushi piece), placed 0.3 units to the right and 0.3 units down from each piece.\n- **Bowl Shadow**: Circle with radius = 2.6 units (0.1 units larger than the bowl), placed 0.2 units to the right and 0.2 units down from the bowl.\n\n\n### **6. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Vector Style**: Clean, sharp edges (no anti-aliasing) to maintain scalability.\n- **Gradients**: Use linear gradients for the plate (light left → dark right) and bowl (light top → dark bottom) to simulate 3D depth.\n- **Patterns**:\n  - **Wood Grain**: Create a <pattern> element with wavy lines in varying brown shades, applied to the table background.\n  - **Nori Roughness**: <pattern> of small black dots, applied to the nori layer.\n  - **Rice Grains**: <pattern> of small white dots, applied to the rice layer.\n  - **Crab Fibers**: <pattern> of thin pink lines, applied to the crab filling.\n\n\n### **7. Additional Details for SVG Recreation**\n- **Lighting Direction**: All gradients and shadows should be consistent with a **top-left light source** (e.g., the left side of the plate is brighter, shadows cast to the bottom-right).\n- **Overlapping**: Sushi pieces overlap slightly (≈0.5 cm) to create a natural, organic cluster.\n- **Fill Variation**: Each sushi piece should have a unique combination of fillings (e.g., one piece with cream cheese + cucumber, another with crab + cream cheese, etc.) to avoid uniformity.\n- **Bowl Lip**: The bowl’s raised lip can be represented by a smaller circle (radius = 2.4 units) centered inside the base circle (radius = 2.5 units), connected by a curved line (the side).\n\n\n### **Summary of SVG Structure**\n1. **Background**: Large rectangle (wooden table) with a brown grain pattern.\n2. **Plate**: Rounded rectangle (light blue) with a gradient, placed on the table.\n3. **Bowl**: Circle (white) with a raised lip, placed on the plate’s bottom-left corner; yellow crumbly topping inside.\n4. **Sushi Rolls**: 16 circles (nori + rice + fillings) arranged diagonally on the plate, with subtle overlapping.\n5. **Shadows**: Separate shapes (plate, sushi, bowl) placed to the bottom-right of each object, with blur effects (if supported) to simulate soft shadows.\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s composition, colors, and textures while maintaining scalability and vector precision.",
  "v1_166": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties with a focus on geometric precision, texture, and spatial relationships. The image is a close-up of a **creamy vegetable curry** in a white bowl, accompanied by a side of rice, a linen napkin, and a wooden-handled spoon—all set on a marble-like countertop. The composition is warm, inviting, and balanced, with vibrant colors contrasting against neutral backgrounds.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on five key objects, arranged to create a cohesive, visually appealing layout:  \n\n#### **A. Main Curry Bowl**  \n- **Shape**: A large, shallow, circular ceramic bowl with a **thin, raised rim** (≈0.1in/0.25cm thick). The bowl’s interior is slightly concave, with the rim curving outward gently.  \n- **Dimensions**: ~6in (15cm) in diameter (occupies 60% of the image width) and ~1in (2.5cm) deep.  \n- **Contents**: A creamy curry sauce filled with:  \n  - **Sweet Potato Chunks**: 8–12 irregularly shaped cuboids (≈1–1.5in/2.5–3.8cm in size). Edges are slightly rounded (not perfect cubes), with some faces flattened.  \n  - **Chickpeas**: ~30–40 whole (and a few split) round legumes (≈0.5in/1.3cm in diameter).  \n  - **Spinach Leaves**: 5–7 wilted, irregularly shaped leaves (≈0.5–1in/1.3–2.5cm long). Veins are visible, and edges are slightly curled.  \n  - **Tomato Pieces**: 3–5 small, irregularly shaped chunks (≈0.3in/0.8cm in size) with red, slightly charred edges.  \n  - **Onion Pieces**: 4–6 translucent, pale yellow slivers (≈0.2in/0.5cm long), mixed into the sauce.  \n\n#### **B. Spoon**  \n- **Shape**: A metal spoon with a **curved bowl** (≈1.5in/3.8cm wide) and a long, cylindrical wooden handle (≈5in/12.5cm long). The handle connects to the spoon bowl via a **metal rivet** (small, round, ≈0.1in/0.25cm in diameter) at the base.  \n- **Position**: The spoon is partially submerged in the curry, with the bowl of the spoon resting in the **left-middle of the main bowl** and the handle extending diagonally to the **bottom-left corner** of the image (beyond the bowl’s edge).  \n\n#### **C. Rice Bowl**  \n- **Shape**: A smaller, deeper circular ceramic bowl with a **thicker rim** (≈0.2in/0.5cm thick) than the main bowl. The exterior is brown; the interior is white.  \n- **Dimensions**: ~4in (10cm) in diameter (1/3 the size of the main bowl) and ~2in (5cm) deep.  \n- **Contents**: A mound of fluffy white rice (≈2in/5cm tall), with individual grains visible but clumped together.  \n\n#### **D. Linen Napkin**  \n- **Shape**: A square (≈4in/10cm) linen napkin folded into a loose, rounded shape with multiple folds. The main fold runs vertically down the center, with smaller, irregular folds on the edges (creating a “loose knot” appearance).  \n- **Position**: Resting on the countertop to the **right of the main bowl** and **below the rice bowl**, overlapping the bottom-right edge of the main bowl.  \n\n#### **E. Countertop**  \n- **Shape**: A large, flat, rectangular surface (filling the entire background) with a marble-like texture.  \n- **Details**: Subtle, irregular veining (thin, curved lines in darker gray) scattered across the surface.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \nThe color palette is warm and vibrant, with the curry as the focal point, contrasted by neutral whites and grays. Textures are varied to mimic real materials (ceramic, wood, linen, food).  \n\n| Object               | Color Palette                                  | Texture/Visual Properties                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Main Curry Bowl**  | Exterior: White (#FFFFFF) with a slight gray rim (#F0F0F0). Interior: White (#FFFFFF). | Smooth, glossy ceramic with a thin, raised rim. The rim has a subtle shadow on the inner edge. |\n| **Curry Sauce**      | Base: Warm yellow-orange (#F0C27B) with a golden tint (#E6B86E). | Creamy, slightly glossy with subtle lumps (use a noise filter or small irregular paths). |\n| **Sweet Potatoes**   | Core: Vibrant orange (#FF8C00). Edges: Brown (#8B4513) (caramelization). | Matte surface with slightly rough edges (not perfect cubes). Use a gradient from orange to brown on edges. |\n| **Chickpeas**        | Pale yellow (#F8ECC2) with a slight greenish tint (#F0E68C). | Matte, bumpy texture (use small circles with subtle gradients to show roundness). |\n| **Spinach Leaves**   | Dark green (#2E8B57) with lighter green veins (#3CB371). | Thin, waxy leaves with visible veins (use thin lines on green shapes). Wilted appearance (curved edges). |\n| **Tomato Pieces**    | Red (#FF4500) with brown edges (#8B0000). | Soft, slightly translucent (use a low-opacity fill for inner parts). |\n| **Onion Pieces**     | Pale yellow (#FFFFE0) with a translucent tint (#FFFACD). | Thin, glossy slices (use a gradient from yellow to white for depth). |\n| **Spoon**            | Handle: Medium brown (#8B4513) with wood grain (subtle horizontal lines). Metal: Silver (#C0C0C0) with a white reflection highlight. | Wooden handle: Warm, textured grain. Metal: Shiny, reflective (use a gradient from silver to white for the bowl). |\n| **Rice Bowl**        | Exterior: Brown (#A0522D) (stoneware). Interior: White (#FFFFFF). | Slightly textured ceramic (use a subtle noise filter on the exterior). Thicker rim than the main bowl. |\n| **Rice**             | White (#FFFFFF) with a slight gray tint (#F0F0F0) for depth. | Fluffy, with individual grains (small, irregular rectangles clustered together). Use a gradient from white to light gray for the mound. |\n| **Linen Napkin**     | White (#FFFFFF) with a slight gray tint (#F5F5F5) in folds. | Soft, linen weave (use a subtle cross-hatch pattern or noise filter). Folds have shadows (#E0E0E0) to show depth. |\n| **Countertop**       | Base: Light gray (#D3D3D3). Veins: Dark gray (#A9A9A9). | Smooth, marble-like with subtle veining (thin, curved lines). Use a gradient from light gray to white for a “shiny” countertop. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe composition is balanced, with the curry bowl as the focal point. The rice bowl and napkin create secondary points of interest, and the spoon adds dynamic flow.  \n\n| Object               | Position Relative to Main Bowl                | Z-Order (Depth) |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Main Curry Bowl**  | Centered slightly left of the image (occupies 60% of the foreground). | Foreground (1st layer) |\n| **Spoon**            | Bowl of the spoon: Left-middle of the curry bowl. Handle: Extends to the bottom-left corner (beyond the bowl’s edge). | Foreground (overlaps the curry bowl) |\n| **Rice Bowl**        | To the right of the main bowl, slightly above (bottom edge aligns with the top 1/3 of the main bowl). | Middle ground (2nd layer) |\n| **Linen Napkin**     | To the right of the main bowl, below the rice bowl (overlaps the bottom-right edge of the main bowl). | Foreground (1st layer) |\n| **Countertop**       | Fills the entire background (supports all objects). | Background (3rd layer) |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \nThe image is **realistic** with a focus on texture and color accuracy. Key artistic choices:  \n- **Focal Point**: The curry bowl is the center of attention, with vibrant colors and detailed ingredients.  \n- **Balance**: The rice bowl (upper right) and napkin (lower right) balance the composition, creating a diagonal flow from the curry to the rice.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, warm lighting (from the top-left) creates subtle highlights on the curry sauce (glossy areas), metal spoon (reflection), and bowl rims. Shadows are soft and subtle (e.g., under the main bowl, in napkin folds).  \n- **Depth of Field**: The main bowl and spoon are in sharp focus; the rice bowl and napkin are slightly blurred (use a Gaussian blur filter in SVG for subtle depth, but keep details visible).  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**  \nTo ensure accuracy, include these critical details:  \n\n#### **Curry Ingredients**  \n- **Sweet Potatoes**: Irregular cuboids (not perfect squares) with rounded edges. Use a gradient from #FF8C00 (core) to #8B4513 (edges) for caramelization.  \n- **Chickpeas**: Round shapes with a slight bump (use a circle with a small indent or gradient). Most are whole; add 2–3 split chickpeas (use a half-circle with a flat edge).  \n- **Spinach Leaves**: Irregularly shaped polygons with thin veins (use #3CB371 lines on #2E8B57 shapes). Wilted appearance (curved edges).  \n- **Tomato Pieces**: Small, irregular shapes with a red core (#FF4500) and brown edges (#8B0000). Use a low opacity (#FF4500, 80%) for translucency.  \n\n#### **Spoon**  \n- **Handle**: Wooden texture (subtle horizontal lines in #8B4513). Add a metal rivet (#C0C0C0) at the connection to the spoon bowl.  \n- **Metal Bowl**: Shiny surface (gradient from #C0C0C0 to #FFFFFF) with a reflection highlight (small white circle).  \n\n#### **Rice Bowl**  \n- **Exterior**: Brown (#A0522D) with a subtle texture (use a noise filter or small dots). Interior: White (#FFFFFF) with a smooth finish.  \n- **Rice**: Cluster of small, irregular rectangles (#FFFFFF) with a gradient from #FFFFFF (top) to #F0F0F0 (bottom) for depth. Add 5–10 individual grains (small #FFFFFF rectangles) on top.  \n\n#### **Napkin**  \n- **Folds**: Use curved paths to mimic linen folds. Add subtle shadows (#E0E0E0) in the creases to show depth.  \n- **Texture**: Linen weave (use a small cross-hatch pattern or noise filter in the fill).  \n\n#### **Countertop**  \n- **Veining**: Irregular, thin lines (#A9A9A9) scattered across the #D3D3D3 base. Use a gradient from #D3D3D3 (center) to #F0F0F0 (edges) for a “shiny” marble effect.  \n\n#### **Lighting/Shadows**  \n- **Highlights**: Add small white circles (low opacity) on the curry sauce (top-left), metal spoon (bowl), and main bowl rim (top edge).  \n- **Shadows**: Soft, subtle shadows (use #A9A9A9 with 20% opacity) under the main bowl (oval shape), rice bowl (small oval), and napkin (irregular shape).  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout**  \nUse these relative proportions for SVG scaling:  \n- **Main Bowl**: 100% width (e.g., 600px) for the image.  \n- **Rice Bowl**: 66% of the main bowl’s width (400px).  \n- **Spoon Handle**: 83% of the main bowl’s diameter (500px) in length.  \n- **Napkin**: 66% of the main bowl’s width (400px) square.  \n\n#### **Layout Guidelines**  \n- **Main Bowl**: Center-left, with the bottom edge aligned to the image’s bottom 1/3.  \n- **Spoon**: Handle extends from the bottom-left corner of the main bowl to the image’s left edge. The bowl of the spoon is 1/3 of the way up the main bowl.  \n- **Rice Bowl**: Positioned 10% to the right of the main bowl, with the bottom edge aligned to the main bowl’s top 1/3.  \n- **Napkin**: Below the rice bowl, overlapping the main bowl’s bottom-right edge by 10%.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Creation**  \nThe SVG must prioritize **geometric accuracy** (irregular shapes for food, precise bowl rims) and **texture replication** (wood grain, linen weave, ceramic gloss). Use gradients for depth (e.g., sweet potato edges, metal spoon reflection) and subtle filters (noise, blur) for realism. The composition should balance the vibrant curry with neutral backgrounds, using spatial relationships to guide the viewer’s eye.  \n\nBy incorporating all these details, the SVG will accurately recreate the image’s warmth, texture, and visual appeal.",
  "v1_167": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, we’ll break down the composition into **main objects**, **colors/textures**, **spatial relationships**, **style**, and **key details**—with precise geometric and proportional information. The image depicts a casual, home-cooked meal on a decorative plate, set on a wooden table.\n\n\n## **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition centers on a **circular plate** with a decorative rim, holding a variety of food items. Below is a breakdown of each object:\n\n### **Plate**\n- **Shape**: Circular, with a **wide decorative rim** (≈20% of the plate’s diameter) and a smooth inner \"food well\" (≈80% of the diameter).  \n- **Rim Pattern**: Repeating **flowers** (5–6 white petals, red center with a white dot) and **oval leaves** (green, with a darker green central vein). The pattern is evenly spaced around the rim.  \n- **Inner Well**: Plain, unpatterned surface where food rests.\n\n### **Tacos (2)**\n- **Shape**: Soft flour tortillas folded into **semicircles** (≈60% of the plate’s inner diameter). The left taco is slightly larger than the right, with a more relaxed fold (organic, hand-folded appearance).  \n- **Filling**: Visible through the tortilla:  \n  - **Chicken**: Irregular, light-brown pieces (2–3 per taco) with darker brown seasoning.  \n  - **Green Bell Peppers**: Thin, bright-green strips (1–2 per taco).  \n  - **Onion**: Translucent white slices (1 per taco).  \n\n### **Coleslaw**\n- **Shape**: Roughly oval mound (≈50% width × 40% height of the plate’s inner well).  \n- **Components**: Shredded vegetables:  \n  - **White Cabbage**: Dominant (≈70%), pale green/white.  \n  - **Purple Cabbage**: Accent (≈20%), deep purple with white veins.  \n  - **Carrots**: Thin orange strips (≈5%).  \n  - **Red Onion**: Pale purple shreds (≈5%).  \n\n### **Shredded Cheese**\n- **Shape**: Uneven mound (≈30% width × 20% height of the coleslaw) on top of the coleslaw.  \n- **Texture**: Thin, jagged shreds (mimicking store-bought cheddar).\n\n### **Lime Wedge**\n- **Shape**: Semicircular wedge (≈1/8 of a full lime), with a curved outer skin and straight inner flesh edge.  \n- **Details**: 3–5 tiny white seeds on the flesh.\n\n### **Spoon**\n- **Shape**: Metal teaspoon with a **long, thin handle** (≈40% of the plate’s diameter) and an **oval bowl** (≈15% of the plate’s diameter).  \n- **Position**: Resting on the left side of the plate, partially under the left taco. The bowl faces upward, reflecting nearby food.\n\n### **Wooden Table**\n- **Shape**: Rectangular surface visible around the plate (top, bottom, left, right).  \n- **Texture**: Visible horizontal grain (dark/light brown streaks).\n\n\n## **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are vibrant but muted (casual, homey vibe). Textures mimic real-world materials (e.g., tortilla roughness, cheese shreds).

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nAssume the **plate is centered** in the SVG (coordinates: `(0,0)` with radius `50` units). Below are relative positions (all measurements are approximate, based on the plate’s radius):\n\n### **Plate**\n- **Outer Rim**: Circle, center `(0,0)`, radius `50` units.  \n- **Inner Well**: Circle, center `(0,0)`, radius `40` units (rim width = `10` units).  \n\n### **Tacos**\n- **Left Taco**: Semicircle, center `(-25, 10)`, radius `25` units (diameter `50` units). Folded vertically (straight edge at `x=-25`; curved edge facing right).  \n- **Right Taco**: Semicircle, center `(25, 10)`, radius `23` units (slightly smaller). Folded vertically (straight edge at `x=25`; curved edge facing left).  \n- **Filling Placement**: Chicken/pepper/onion pieces are visible through the tortillas, concentrated in the upper half of each taco.\n\n### **Coleslaw**\n- **Position**: Center of the inner well, below the tacos.  \n- **Shape**: Oval, center `(0, -10)`, width `40` units (x: `-20` to `20`), height `30` units (y: `-25` to `5`).  \n\n### **Shredded Cheese**\n- **Position**: Top of the coleslaw, slightly offset to the right.  \n- **Shape**: Irregular oval, center `(5, -5)`, width `25` units (x: `-12.5` to `12.5`), height `15` units (y: `-12.5` to `2.5`).  \n\n### **Lime Wedge**\n- **Position**: Right side of the inner well, next to the right taco.  \n- **Shape**: Semicircle, center `(35, -20)`, radius `10` units (diameter `20` units). Straight edge at `y=-20` (flesh facing inward); curved edge (skin) facing right.  \n\n### **Spoon**\n- **Position**: Left side of the inner well, partially under the left taco.  \n- **Handle**: Line from `(-45, -35)` to `(-10, -10)` (length `35` units), width `5` units. Curved slightly at the end.  \n- **Bowl**: Oval, center `(-25, -15)`, length `15` units (along the handle), width `10` units. Facing upward (reflective surface).  \n\n### **Wooden Table**\n- **Extent**: Fills the background, visible around the plate (x: `-100` to `100`; y: `-100` to `100`).  \n- **Grain**: Horizontal lines (opacity: 10–20%) running left-right, with varying shades of brown (see **Colors** section).\n\n\n## **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism with Vector Simplification**: The image is a photograph, but the SVG should mimic realistic textures (e.g., tortilla roughness, cheese shreds) using vector tools (e.g., gradients, patterns, noise filters).  \n- **Casual/Homely Vibe**: Food items are arranged informally (uneven mounds, folded tacos). Avoid perfect symmetry—e.g., the left taco is slightly larger than the right, and the cheese pile is lopsided.  \n- **Organic vs. Geometric**: The plate’s rim has a **repeating geometric pattern** (flowers/leaves), but the food items (coleslaw, cheese, tacos) have **organic, irregular shapes**.  \n- **Depth**: Use subtle gradients (e.g., on the spoon bowl, lime flesh) to create depth. The table’s grain adds a natural, tactile feel.\n\n\n## **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No Text**: The image contains no text.  \n- **Plate Pattern**: The rim’s flower/leaf pattern is **evenly spaced** (e.g., 8 flowers and 8 leaves around the rim). Each flower has a **red center** (1 unit diameter) with a **white dot** (0.2 units diameter) and 5–6 **white petals** (2 units long, 1 unit wide). Leaves are **oval** (5 units long, 2 units wide) with a **dark green vein** (0.5 units wide).  \n- **Taco Filling**: Visible pieces of chicken (2–3 per taco), green pepper (1–2 strips per taco), and onion (1 slice per taco). Use **irregular polygons** for chicken (avoid perfect rectangles).  \n- **Coleslaw Shreds**: Mix of **long, thin rectangles** (cabbage/carrot) and **short, wide rectangles** (red onion). Vary the angle (0–45 degrees) for a \"tossed\" look.  \n- **Cheese Shreds**: Jagged, thin rectangles (1–3 units long, 0.5 units wide). Overlap some shreds to create depth.  \n- **Lime Seeds**: 3–5 tiny circles (`#FFFFFF`, 0.3 units diameter) on the lime flesh.  \n- **Spoon Reflection**: Add a **gradient** to the spoon bowl (light yellow `#FFFFE0` to light purple `#E6E6FA`) to mimic the reflection of the cheese and coleslaw.  \n- **Wood Grain**: Use a **pattern of horizontal lines** (0.5 units thick) with varying opacity (10–30%) to mimic the table’s texture. Alternate between `#A0522D` (light) and `#654321` (dark) for streaks.\n\n\n## **Key Proportions for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the **plate’s radius** (50 units) as a reference:  \n| Object               | Proportion to Plate Radius (50 units) |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Plate Outer Rim      | 100% (radius = 50 units)               |\n| Plate Inner Well     | 80% (radius = 40 units)                |\n| Taco Radius          | 50% (left taco = 25 units; right taco = 23 units) |\n| Coleslaw Width       | 80% of inner well (40 units)           |\n| Coleslaw Height      | 60% of inner well (30 units)           |\n| Cheese Pile Width    | 50% of coleslaw (25 units)             |\n| Cheese Pile Height   | 50% of coleslaw (15 units)             |\n| Lime Wedge Radius    | 20% (10 units)                         |\n| Spoon Handle Length  | 70% (35 units)                         |\n| Spoon Bowl Length    | 30% (15 units)                         |\n\n\n## **SVG Creation Checklist**\nTo recreate the image accurately, ensure:  \n1. **Layer Order**: Table (bottom) → Plate (middle) → Food (top) → Spoon (top-left).  \n2. **Clipping Masks**: Use a clipping mask for the plate’s inner well (hide food items outside the 40-unit radius).  \n3. **Gradients**: Add gradients to the spoon (reflection), lime flesh (depth), and table (grain).  \n4. **Patterns**: Use a repeating pattern for the plate’s rim (flowers/leaves) and table’s grain.  \n5. **Organic Shapes**: Avoid perfect circles/rectangles for food items (e.g., tacos, coleslaw, cheese). Use **path tools** to create irregular edges.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, you’ll create an SVG that accurately mimics the image’s composition, texture, and vibe—while retaining the flexibility of vector graphics.",
  "v1_168": "To recreate this image as an **SVG** (scalable vector graphic), the following detailed description breaks down every critical element—from geometric shapes and proportions to textures, lighting, and spatial relationships. The goal is to provide a blueprint for accurate vectorization, emphasizing replicable details for a realistic (yet simplified) result.\n\n\n## **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **seated human figure** in an industrial setting, leaning against a **concrete ledge** with embedded metal hardware. Key elements include:\n\n### **Human Figure (Central Subject)**\n- **Posture**: Slouched with knees raised to chest level; back pressed against the ledge’s vertical face; head resting on the ledge’s horizontal top surface (right side of the head makes contact).  \n- **Arms**: Crossed at the elbows over knees:  \n  - **Left arm** (viewer’s perspective): Rests on top of the right arm, extending from the shoulder to the wrist.  \n  - **Right arm**: Lies beneath the left, with hands clasped loosely (fingers interlaced).  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - **White tank top**: Sleeveless, loose-fitting, with a **U-neck** (wider at the bottom, narrower at the top) and thin straps (≈5mm wide) over the shoulders.  \n  - **Dark blue jeans**: Wrinkled, pulled up to the knees (no cuffs), with a loose fit around the thighs.  \n- **Hair**: Short (above ears), wavy, and wet-looking (strands cling to the scalp).  \n\n### **Concrete Ledge**\n- **Shape**: A **rectangular prism** spanning the **upper 1/3 of the image** (horizontal orientation).  \n  - **Top surface**: Flat, wide (≈70% of the image width), with a slightly rounded front edge (where the figure’s head rests).  \n  - **Vertical face**: Tall enough to support the figure’s back (≈15cm in real-world scale).  \n- **Embedded Hardware**:  \n  - **Metal brackets**: Rectangular plates (≈2cm wide) bolted to the ledge’s top surface (1 on the left, 1 on the right).  \n  - **Bolts**: 2–3 per bracket (≈5mm diameter), with recessed centers.  \n  - **Diagonal pipes**: Two cylindrical metal pipes (≈2cm diameter) attached to the brackets:  \n    - **Left pipe**: Extends from the upper left corner diagonally downward (30° from horizontal).  \n    - **Right pipe**: Extends from the upper right corner diagonally downward (30° from horizontal).  \n\n### **Background**\n- **Industrial elements**: Blurred concrete and metal structures behind the ledge (midground/background), contributing to depth but not requiring detailed vectorization (use soft gradients to suggest).\n\n\n## **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image uses **natural daylight** (late afternoon) with warm golden highlights and deep shadows. Textures are tactile and gritty, emphasizing the industrial setting.\n\n### **Concrete Ledge**\n- **Color**: Dominant **cool gray** (#808080) with variations from embedded aggregate:  \n  - Small stones: Black (#000000), brown (#A52A2A), and white (#FFFFFF).  \n  - Rust stains: Subtle orange-brown (#D2691E) in crevices.  \n- **Texture**: **Exposed aggregate** (granular, rough). Simulate with:  \n  - A **pattern** of irregular circles/squares (1–3mm) in gray/black/brown, tiled across the top surface.  \n  - **Scratches**: Fine white lines (1–2cm long) to suggest wear.  \n- **Lighting**:  \n  - **Highlights**: Bright white (#FFFFFF) gradient on the **left 1/3 of the top surface** (direct sunlight).  \n  - **Shadows**: Deep gray (#404040) in the gap between the ledge and the figure’s back (soft blur for depth).  \n\n### **Metal Pipes/Brackets**\n- **Color**:  \n  - Pipes: Rusty brown (#8B4513) with black (#000000) oxidation.  \n  - Brackets: Dark brown (#5C3317) with silver (#C0C0C0) bolt heads.  \n- **Texture**: **Corroded** (matte finish with subtle scratches). Simulate with:  \n  - **Rust spots**: Irregular orange-brown (#D2691E) shapes (2–5mm) on the pipes.  \n  - **Scratches**: Fine white lines (1–2cm long) on the brackets.  \n\n### **Human Figure**\n- **Skin**:  \n  - **Base color**: Warm beige (#F5DEB3) with golden highlights (#FFD700) on the left arm, shoulder, and cheekbone (sunlight).  \n  - **Shadows**: Soft brown (#8B4513) on the right side of the face and under the arms.  \n  - **Sweat droplets**: Small (1–2mm) white (#FFFFFF) circles with a **gradient** (lighter center, darker edge) on the forearms, shoulders, and chest (≈10–15 droplets total).  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - **Tank top**: Bright white (#FFFFFF) with a smooth, stretchy texture. Add subtle wrinkles (thin gray lines) at the neckline and underarms.  \n  - **Jeans**: Dark blue (#191970) with a faded, worn look. Use **diagonal lines** (1–2cm long) to simulate creases on the thighs and knees.  \n- **Hair**:  \n  - **Color**: Dark brown (#2F1700) with golden highlights (#FFD700) on the top of the head.  \n  - **Texture**: Wet-looking (strands cling to the scalp). Simulate with **fine wavy lines** (1–2mm long) in dark brown, with lighter highlights.  \n\n### **Lighting**\n- **Source**: Upper left (30° from horizontal), casting:  \n  - **Highlights**: On the figure’s left arm, cheekbone, and the ledge’s left edge.  \n  - **Shadows**: On the figure’s right side (face, body) and under the ledge (use a **50% opacity dark gray** with a 5px blur).  \n\n\n## **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition follows the **rule of thirds**, with the figure’s head at the intersection of the upper right third. Key spatial guidelines:\n\n### **Figure vs. Ledge**\n- The figure occupies the **lower 2/3 of the image**, leaning against the ledge (upper 1/3).  \n- **Head**: Rests on the ledge’s top surface (right side of the head is flush with the ledge).  \n- **Arms**: Crossed over knees (left arm on top, right arm beneath).  \n- **Knees**: Raised to chest level (thighs parallel to the ground).  \n\n### **Pipes vs. Ledge**\n- **Left pipe**: Attached to the ledge’s left bracket, extending diagonally downward to the left (ends at the image’s left edge).  \n- **Right pipe**: Attached to the ledge’s right bracket, extending diagonally downward to the right (ends at the image’s right edge).  \n- **Depth**: Pipes are in the **midground** (slightly blurred in the original image—use a 3px blur in SVG to suggest).  \n\n### **Proportions (for SVG Scaling)**\nUse a **vertical canvas** (e.g., 1000px height × 750px width) with the following proportions:  \n- **Figure**:  \n  - **Total height** (head to knees): 600px.  \n  - **Head**: 75px tall × 60px wide (oval shape).  \n  - **Arms**: Left arm (upper): 200px long × 30px wide; right arm (lower): 220px long × 30px wide.  \n  - **Tank top**: U-neck (100px wide at the bottom, 50px wide at the top) with 5mm wide straps.  \n  - **Jeans**: 300px wide at the knees, tapering to 150px at the ankles (rolled up slightly).  \n- **Ledge**:  \n  - **Top surface**: 700px wide × 100px deep (horizontal).  \n  - **Vertical face**: 700px wide × 150px tall.  \n- **Pipes**:  \n  - **Diameter**: 20px.  \n  - **Length**: Left pipe (400px), right pipe (350px).  \n\n\n## **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Genre**: Realistic portrait with industrial grit.  \n- **Tone**: Intimate and introspective (figure’s neutral gaze and slouched posture).  \n- **Texture Focus**: Emphasis on tactile surfaces (concrete aggregate, rusty metal, denim) to enhance realism.  \n- **Composition**: Dynamic diagonal lines (pipes) lead the viewer’s eye to the figure’s face (focal point).  \n\n\n## **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**\nThese details are critical for accuracy and must be included in the vector:\n\n### **Sweat Droplets**\n- **Position**: On the figure’s forearms (5–7 droplets), shoulders (2–3), and chest (1–2).  \n- **Shape**: Small circles (1–2mm diameter) with a **gradient** (white center, gray edge) to simulate shine.  \n\n### **Tank Top**\n- **Neckline**: U-shaped (wider at the bottom, narrower at the top).  \n- **Straps**: Thin (5mm wide), with a slight curve where they meet the neckline.  \n\n### **Jeans**\n- **Wrinkles**: Parallel and diagonal lines (1–2cm long) on the thighs and knees, with darker shading (50% opacity gray) in the creases.  \n\n### **Ledge Brackets**\n- **Shape**: Rectangular (50px wide × 20px tall) with rounded corners.  \n- **Bolts**: Circular (3–4mm diameter) with a recessed center (use a **radial gradient** to simulate depth).  \n\n### **Hair**\n- **Strands**: Fine wavy lines (1–2mm long) in dark brown, with lighter highlights (golden yellow) on the top of the head.  \n\n### **Facial Features**\n- **Eyes**: Deep-set, with a neutral gaze (looking to the left of the frame). Use a **dark brown** (pupils) and **light brown** (irises) with a small white highlight (1mm diameter) for shine.  \n- **Mouth**: Slightly downturned (thin line in dark brown).  \n- **Cheekbones**: Subtle highlight (golden yellow) to add dimension.  \n\n\n## **6. Geometric Guidelines for SVG**\nUse these measurements (based on a 1000px × 750px canvas) to ensure proportional accuracy:\n\n| Element               | Dimensions                  | Shape               |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Ledge top surface     | 700px wide × 100px deep     | Rectangle           |\n| Ledge vertical face   | 700px wide × 150px tall     | Rectangle           |\n| Left pipe             | 400px long × 20px diameter  | Cylinder (path)     |\n| Right pipe            | 350px long × 20px diameter  | Cylinder (path)     |\n| Figure’s head         | 75px tall × 60px wide       | Oval                |\n| Figure’s left arm     | 200px long × 30px wide      | Rectangle (rounded edges) |\n| Figure’s right arm    | 220px long × 30px wide      | Rectangle (rounded edges) |\n| Tank top neckline     | 100px wide (bottom) × 50px wide (top) | U-shape |\n| Jeans (knees)         | 300px wide                  | Rectangle (rounded edges) |\n\n\n## **7. Texture Patterns for SVG**\n- **Concrete Ledge**: Create a **pattern** of small irregular circles and squares (1–3mm) in gray, black, and brown. Tile this pattern across the ledge’s top surface.  \n- **Metal Pipes**: Use a **pattern** of rust spots (irregular orange-brown shapes) with a subtle noise filter (10% opacity) to simulate corrosion.  \n- **Denim Jeans**: Add a **diagonal line pattern** (1mm wide, 10px spacing) in light blue to simulate the woven texture.  \n\n\n## **8. Final Notes for Realism**\n- **Blur**: Use a **5px Gaussian blur** on the background (pipes and distant concrete) to create depth.  \n- **Gradients**: Use **linear gradients** for highlights (e.g., on the figure’s arm) and **radial gradients** for bolts and sweat droplets.  \n- **Opacity**: Use 50–70% opacity for shadows to avoid a “flat” look.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately replicate the original image’s composition, texture, and lighting—while remaining scalable and editable.",
  "v1_169": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details**—including geometric proportions, texture cues, and layout constraints. The image is a iconic still from *The Godfather* (1972), featuring four men in formal attire (three in tuxedos, one in a U.S. Marine Corps uniform) standing closely together in a semi-formal outdoor setting.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition centers on **four standing figures** (left to right) and a blurred background. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground: Four Men**\nAll are roughly the same height (≈1.8m in real-world scale) and positioned shoulder-to-shoulder, with subtle overlaps (e.g., an arm around the central figure).  \n- **Figure 1 (Leftmost)**: Curly reddish-brown hair, clean-shaven, wearing a **black tuxedo** (single-button jacket, peak lapels, white dress shirt, black bow tie). Hands at sides.  \n- **Figure 2 (Second from Left)**: Short dark hair (partially hidden by a **black wide-brimmed fedora**), mustached, wearing an identical tuxedo. His **right arm is bent at the elbow**, with a hand resting on the central figure’s left shoulder (fingers extended, thumb tucked).  \n- **Figure 3 (Central/Focal Point)**: Short military buzz cut, wearing a **U.S. Marine Corps Service Dress Uniform**:  \n  - **Headgear**: Olive drab cap (cover) with a stiff black visor and a silver **eagle, globe, and anchor (EGA)** emblem (Marine Corps insignia) on the front.  \n  - **Coat**: Olive drab, buttoned at the collar and chest (two visible brass buttons), with shoulder epaulettes (rank insignia indistinct) and a row of **7 ribbons** on the left chest.  \n  - **Shirt/Tie**: Light tan dress shirt, dark tan necktie.  \n- **Figure 4 (Rightmost)**: Slicked-back dark hair, clean-shaven, wearing an identical tuxedo to Figures 1 and 2. Hands at sides.  \n\n#### **Background**\nA soft, out-of-focus setting suggesting a porch or entrance:  \n- **Walls**: Light cream-colored, with thick dark brown wooden beams (horizontal and vertical) forming a grid.  \n- **Lantern**: Dark gray wall sconce (left side) with a glass panel, emitting warm ambient light.  \n- **Indistinct Details**: Faint reflections or decorations (e.g., a window) behind the figures, blurred to keep focus on the foreground.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are muted and formal, with high contrast between the dark tuxedos and the military uniform. Textures vary to signal formality and function:  \n\n| Element | Color (Hex Code) | Texture/Visual Property |\n|---------|------------------|-------------------------|\n| Tuxedo jackets | `#000000` (black) | Smooth, glossy (subtle sheen from front lighting). |\n| Tuxedo shirts | `#FFFFFF` (white) | Matte, crisp (highly reflective in highlights). |\n| Bow ties | `#000000` (black) | Satin-like, symmetrical. |\n| Marine Corps coat | `#3C3C2E` (olive drab) | Matte, structured (cotton/wool blend, slight grain). |\n| Marine Corps shirt | `#D9C2A3` (light tan) | Soft, breathable (linen/cotton). |\n| Marine Corps tie | `#B89A74` (dark tan) | Smooth, narrow. |\n| Medals/Ribbons | Varied (e.g., `#FF0000` (red), `#0000FF` (blue), `#FFFF00` (yellow), `#FFFFFF` (white)) | Shiny, metallic (ribbons have flat, woven texture). |\n| Background walls | `#E0D6C7` (light cream) | Soft, slightly porous (plaster). |\n| Wooden beams | `#4B3621` (dark brown) | Rough, weathered (wood grain visible in blur). |\n| Lantern | `#2D2D2D` (dark gray) | Dull, metallic (cast iron). |\n| Hair (Figure 1) | `#A0522D` (reddish-brown) | Curly, textured (loose waves). |\n| Hair (Figure 2) | `#331900` (dark brown) | Short, wavy (partially hidden by hat). |\n| Hair (Figure 3) | `#111111` (black) | Neat, cropped (military buzz cut). |\n| Hair (Figure 4) | `#000000` (black) | Slicked-back, smooth (pomade). |\n\n#### **Key Textural Cues for SVG**\n- **Tuxedos**: Use a linear gradient (`#1A1A1A` to `#000000`) on the jacket to mimic sheen.  \n- **Military Uniform**: Add a subtle noise filter (`0.5%` monochrome) to the coat to replicate fabric grain.  \n- **Background**: Apply a low-opacity (`10%`) grain pattern to evoke film texture (vintage photo effect).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe figures are tightly framed, with a **1:1.5 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1000px wide × 600px tall) to emphasize their proximity. Below is a coordinate system (x: 0–1000, y: 0–600) for precise placement:  \n\n| Figure | X-Range | Y-Range | Key Positioning |\n|--------|---------|---------|-----------------|\n| 1 (Curly Hair) | 0–280 | 0–600 | Leftmost, no overlap with others. |\n| 2 (Fedora) | 260–560 | 0–600 | Second from left; **right arm overlaps** with Figure 3 (elbow at `x=500, y=300`, hand at `x=550–600, y=350–400`). |\n| 3 (Military) | 500–820 | 0–600 | Central focal point; **left shoulder overlaps** with Figure 2’s hand. |\n| 4 (Slick Hair) | 780–1000 | 0–600 | Rightmost, adjacent to Figure 3 (no overlap). |\n\n#### **Proportions**\n- **Heights**:  \n  - Top of Figure 2’s fedora: `y=20` (tallest point).  \n  - Top of Figure 1’s hair: `y=30`.  \n  - Top of Figure 3’s cap: `y=40`.  \n  - Top of Figure 4’s hair: `y=30`.  \n  - Bottom of image: `y=600` (cuts off at mid-torso for all figures).  \n- **Widths**: Each figure occupies ~25% of the image width, with Figure 3 (military) slightly wider (28%) due to the arm overlap.  \n- **Arm Around Shoulder**: Figure 2’s right arm is bent at 90°, with fingers (index, middle, ring, pinky) resting on Figure 3’s left shoulder. The thumb is tucked under the shoulder seam.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic cinematic still** with:  \n- **Warm, Soft Lighting**: Front-left key light (casts subtle shadows on the right sides of faces) and backlighting (highlights hair and tuxedo lapels).  \n- **Vintage Film Grain**: Low-level noise (`1–2%`) to replicate 1970s 35mm film.  \n- **Balanced Composition**: Symmetrical tuxedos on either side of the military figure create a focal point (his uniform and the arm around him draw the eye).  \n- **Subtle Shadows**:  \n  - Figure 3’s cap casts a shadow over his eyes (`y=150–200, x=600–750`).  \n  - Soft shadows on the right cheeks of all figures (from front-left lighting).  \n\n#### **Artistic Tone**\nThe mood is tense and formal, with the military figure’s rigid posture contrasting with the relaxed arm of Figure 2. The vintage grain and muted colors evoke nostalgia and gravity (consistent with *The Godfather*’s thematic tone).\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Critical for SVG Reproduction)**\n#### **Military Uniform Insignia**\n- **Cap Emblem**: Centered on Figure 3’s cap (`x=680, y=80`). The **EGA** (eagle, globe, anchor) is 20px wide × 15px tall, with a silver fill (`#C0C0C0`).  \n- **Collar Insignia**: Small EGA emblems on both collars of Figure 3’s coat (`x=620, y=220` and `x=740, y=220`).  \n- **Ribbons**: 7 ribbons on the left chest (`x=650–750, y=350–400`), arranged in a straight row. Each ribbon is 10px wide × 5px tall, with distinct colors (e.g., first ribbon: `#FF0000` (red) with `#FFFFFF` (white) stripes).  \n\n#### **Tuxedo Details**\n- **Lapels**: Peak lapels (pointed at the top) on all tuxedos. The lapel width is 30px (Figure 1: `x=50–100, y=180–250`; Figure 2: `x=300–350, y=180–250`; Figure 4: `x=850–900, y=180–250`).  \n- **Buttons**: One button at the top of each tuxedo jacket (`y=250`; Figure 1: `x=120`; Figure 2: `x=380`; Figure 4: `x=880`).  \n\n#### **Arm Around Shoulder**\n- Figure 2’s right arm is bent at the elbow (`x=500, y=300`), with a hand resting on Figure 3’s left shoulder. The hand is 30px wide × 20px tall, with visible fingers (index, middle, ring, pinky) and a tucked thumb.  \n\n#### **Background Lantern**\n- Positioned on the left wall (`x=20–80, y=100–250`). The lantern has a rectangular body (`#2D2D2D`) with a curved top and a glass panel (`#E0E0E0`) emitting warm light (low-opacity `#FFD700` gradient).  \n\n#### **Film Grain**\n- Add a **noise filter** to the entire image (`1%` monochrome, `0.5px` radius) to replicate vintage film texture.  \n\n#### **Shadows**\n- Use soft clipping masks with low opacity (`15%`) to create subtle shadows (e.g., Figure 1’s right cheek: `x=150–200, y=100–200`).  \n\n\n### **Summary of SVG Requirements**\nTo recreate the image accurately, the SVG must:  \n1. **Prioritize Focal Point**: Use color contrast (military uniform vs. tuxedos) and positioning (central figure) to draw attention to Figure 3.  \n2. **Replicate Textures**: Use gradients (tuxedos), noise (military uniform), and grain (background) to mimic real-world materials.  \n3. **Accurately Place Insignia**: The EGA on the cap and collar, plus the row of ribbons, are critical for the military uniform’s authenticity.  \n4. **Preserve Spatial Proximity**: Ensure the arm overlap between Figure 2 and 3 is visible, with precise finger placement.  \n5. **Evoke Vintage Tone**: Apply film grain and soft shadows to match the 1970s cinematic style.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will capture both the visual and thematic essence of the original image.",
  "v1_17": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, we’ll break down the composition into vector-friendly elements, emphasizing geometric precision, proportionality, and spatial relationships. Below is a detailed, structured description of every key component:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a group portrait of **13 people** (3 crouching in the front row, 10 standing in the back row) posing on a snowy ski slope. Central to the composition is a **green flag** held by the back row, and several individuals holding **skis** or **snowboards**.

Person in a **plaid jacket** (black, gray, white check), **black pants**, **green helmet**, and **black gloves**. Holds a **pair of skis** (vertical) with a green/black/white graphic design.\n\n#### **Central Flag**\n- **Shape:** Rectangle (approx. 1.5x1 meter, proportional to the people holding it).\n- **Design:** Green field with a **stylized white snowflake** (6 points, each with a smaller sub-point) in the center. Above the snowflake: white capital text **\"SPARTAN\"**; below: white capital text **\"SKI CLUB\"**.\n- **Position:** Held horizontally by 3 people in the center of the back row (persons 3–5), with their hands gripping the top and bottom edges.\n\n#### **Skis/Snowboards**\n- **Left Back Row (Person 1):** Blue snowboard (vertical) with white text **\"NITRO\"** (assumed, common brand) on the top.\n- **Right Back Row (Person 7):** White ski (vertical) with floral patterns (pink/blue).\n- **Far Right (Person 10):** Pair of skis (vertical) with green/black/white graphic design (e.g., **\"K2\"** logo, common brand).\n- **Front Left (Person 1):** Black skis (horizontal) lying on the snow, with white bindings.\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Snowy Slope:** Expansive, uneven surface occupying 80% of the image.\n- **Trees:** Tall, bare-branched deciduous trees on the left (1 large tree) and right (dense grove). The leftmost tree has a **yellow marker** on its trunk.\n- **Building:** Gray, rectangular structure on the right with a sloped roof and a small overhang. A **blue shed** (or ticket booth) is attached to its left side.\n- **Distant Skiers:** 5–6 small figures (1–2 pixels tall) on the slope, 50–100 meters away, to indicate depth.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Colors**\n- **Flag:** Green (#2E8B57) with white (#FFFFFF) snowflake/text.\n- **Jackets:**\n  - Beige: #F5F0E6 (matte, most common).\n  - Blue-gray: #4682B4 (top), #808080 (middle), #000000 (bottom) (gradient, glossy).\n  - Black: #000000 (matte, front left).\n  - Red: #DC143C (matte, back right).\n  - Plaid: #402000 (brown), #808080 (gray), #FFFFFF (white) (checkered, textured).\n- **Pants:**\n  - Red: #FF0000 (front left).\n  - Gray: #808080 (front center/right).\n  - Light blue: #ADD8E6 (back right).\n  - Black: #000000 (most back row).\n  - Khaki: #F0E68C (left back row).\n- **Helmets/Goggles:**\n  - Helmets: Blue (#4682B4), black (#000000), green (#2E8B57).\n  - Goggles: Blue (#4682B4), green (#2E8B57), clear (some).\n- **Skis/Snowboards:**\n  - Blue snowboard: #1E90FF (matte).\n  - White ski: #FFFFFF (matte) with floral patterns (#FFC0CB, #1E90FF).\n  - Green/black skis: #2E8B57 (green), #000000 (black), #FFFFFF (white) (glossy).\n- **Snow:** #F0F8FF (pale blue-white) with subtle gray (#D3D3D3) shadows to indicate texture.\n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Snow:** Uneven, granular texture (replicated in SVG with a subtle noise filter or small, random lines).\n- **Jackets:**\n  - Beige: Matte (smooth, no glare).\n  - Blue-gray: Glossy (subtle reflection highlights).\n  - Plaid: Textured (checkered pattern, 1cm squares).\n  - Red: Fuzzy (subtle fur texture, e.g., fleece).\n- **Skis:** Glossy (reflective surfaces, especially the green/black pair).\n- **Trees:** Rough bark texture (small, vertical lines on trunks).\n\n#### **Visual Properties**\n- **Lighting:** Soft, diffused daylight (overcast sky) with no harsh shadows. Snow reflects light, making the foreground brighter than the background.\n- **Depth:** Created by diminishing size (distant skiers/trees) and reduced detail (background elements are less sharp).\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n#### **Group Layout**\n- **Front Row:** 3 people crouching in a straight line, centered horizontally. Their heads are at chest level of the back row.\n- **Back Row:** 10 people standing in a curved line (slightly convex) to fit the flag. The flag is positioned at the vertical center of the back row, overlapping the chests of persons 3–5.\n- **Skis/Snowboards:**\n  - Left back row (Person 1): Snowboard held at shoulder height, leaning against their body.\n  - Right back row (Person 7): Ski held at shoulder height, parallel to their body.\n  - Far right (Person 10): Skis held vertically, tips above their head.\n  - Front left (Person 1): Skis lying on the snow, extending from their left foot to the left edge of the image.\n\n#### **Background Hierarchy**\n- **Foreground:** Group of people (100% opacity, highest z-index).\n- **Midground:** Snow slope (80% opacity, medium z-index).\n- **Background:** Trees, building, distant skiers (50% opacity, lowest z-index).\n\n#### **Proportions**\n- **People:** Average height (1.7–1.8 meters) represented as 150–160 pixels tall in SVG. Crouching people are 100–110 pixels tall.\n- **Flag:** 120 pixels wide × 80 pixels tall (proportional to the 3 people holding it; each person’s arm span is ~60 pixels).\n- **Skis:** 180 pixels tall (taller than the person holding them, who is 150 pixels tall).\n- **Trees:** Leftmost tree is 200 pixels tall (taller than the group).\n- **Distant Skiers:** 5–10 pixels tall (tiny, to show depth).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n#### **Style**\n- **Realistic Vector:** The image is a photograph, but for SVG, it’s translated into clean, geometric shapes with detailed textures. The goal is to retain photographic realism while using vector tools.\n- **Flat Design with Details:** Basic shapes (rectangles, ellipses) are used for bodies/jackets, with added details (collars, cuffs, logos) to enhance realism.\n\n#### **Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Balance:** The group is centered, with skis/snowboards on the left/right to create symmetry. The flag acts as a visual focal point.\n- **Rhythm:** The repetition of beige jackets (back row) creates a cohesive rhythm, broken by the blue-gray/red/plaid jackets (left/right) for contrast.\n- **Contrast:** Dark jackets (front left/right) contrast with light beige jackets (back row), drawing attention to the flag.\n\n#### **SVG-Specific Considerations**\n- **Compound Paths:** Use compound paths for the snowflake (to avoid overlapping shapes) and ski graphics (to maintain sharp edges).\n- **Filters:** Apply a **noise filter** to the snow (opacity 10%) to replicate texture. Use a **blur filter** on distant trees/skiers to enhance depth.\n- **Patterns:** Create a **plaid pattern** (1cm squares) for the far right person’s jacket, and a **floral pattern** for the white ski (Person 7).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**\n- **Flag:** White sans-serif text (e.g., **Arial Bold**) with:\n  - **\"SPARTAN\"** (above the snowflake, 12 pixels tall).\n  - **\"SKI CLUB\"** (below the snowflake, 10 pixels tall).\n- **Snowboard (Person 1):** White text **\"NITRO\"** (10 pixels tall) on the blue snowboard.\n- **Skis (Person 10):** White text **\"K2\"** (8 pixels tall) on the green/black skis.\n- **Name Tags:**\n  - **Front Center (Person 2):** White rectangular name tag (10×5 pixels) on the chest of their beige jacket.\n  - **Back Row (Persons 1, 8):** Small white name tags (5×3 pixels) on their blue-gray jackets.\n\n#### **Symbols**\n- **Snowflake (Flag):** Stylized 6-pointed snowflake with 6 sub-points (total 12 points), created with overlapping triangles. The snowflake is 40 pixels in diameter.\n- **Jacket Logos:**\n  - **Front Left (Person 1):** Small blue logo (5×5 pixels) on the chest of their black jacket (e.g., **Patagonia**).\n  - **Back Left (Person 1):** Small white logo (5×5 pixels) on the chest of their blue-gray jacket (e.g., **The North Face**).\n- **Helmet Logos:** Small colored logos (3×3 pixels) on helmets (e.g., **Giro** on blue helmets, **Smith** on green helmets).\n\n#### **Specific Details**\n- **Gloves:** Most people wear gloves (white, black, tan). The front left person (Person 1) has gloves hanging from their belt.\n- **Goggles:** Goggles have colored lenses (blue, green) and white frames. The front center person (Person 2) has a black face mask.\n- **Name Tags:** The front center person (Person 2) has a visible name tag (e.g., **\"JOHN\"**) on their beige jacket.\n- **Helmet on Snow:** Front left person (Person 1) has a black helmet (with a blue stripe) on the snow in front of them.\n- **Yellow Tree Marker:** Leftmost tree has a yellow rectangle (10×5 pixels) on its trunk, 1/3 from the bottom.\n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo recreate this image accurately in SVG, follow these key steps:\n\n1. **Block Out Main Shapes:** Use rectangles for bodies, jackets, pants, and the flag. Use ellipses for heads, helmets, and goggles.\n2. **Add Details:** Use smaller shapes for collars, cuffs, pockets, logos, and goggle lenses. Use compound paths for the snowflake and ski graphics.\n3. **Apply Colors/Textures:** Fill shapes with the specified colors. Add textures (noise for snow, plaid for the jacket) using filters/patterns.\n4. **Position Elements:** Use the spatial relationships and proportions outlined above to arrange the group, flag, skis, and background elements.\n5. **Add Text:** Use the specified fonts and sizes for the flag text and name tags.\n6. **Enhance Realism:** Apply blur filters to distant elements, add shadow effects (subtle gray shapes) under the group and skis, and adjust opacity for depth.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you’ll create a detailed, accurate SVG reproduction of the original image.",
  "v1_170": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image (a still from *The Dark Knight*, 2008), the following detailed breakdown of **main elements, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** is provided. The description prioritizes geometric precision, texture, and proportional accuracy to guide vectorization.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is a **close-up portrait** of a character (the Joker) holding a **Joker playing card** in their left hand (viewer’s perspective). The focal point is the character’s face and the card, with a blurred background to emphasize depth of field.  \n\n#### Key Objects:\n- **Character**: Head and upper torso dominate the frame. Features include:  \n  - **Hair**: Medium-length, wavy, and unkempt, falling to the shoulders.  \n  - **Face**: Covered in thick, caked white makeup, with exaggerated black eye makeup, red lip/streak makeup, and a wide, toothy smile.  \n  - **Attire**: Deep purple leather coat (with shoulder pads), matching purple leather gloves, a dark gray checkered dress shirt, and a dark tie (subtle pattern).  \n- **Joker Card**: Standard playing-card size, held at a 30° angle (tilted toward the viewer). The card depicts a **grotesque Joker figure** in a purple coat, yellow waistcoat, and white shirt, holding a staff with a severed head (blood splatter included). Text: *“JOKER”* at the top-left and bottom-right corners.  \n- **Background**: Blurred, abstract environment (likely a industrial/urban setting, e.g., a warehouse or subway) with soft edges to draw focus to the character.  \n\n#### Geometric Shapes:\n- **Face**: Oval shape, with high cheekbones and a squared jaw.  \n- **Card**: Rectangle (3:5 aspect ratio, standard poker card dimensions: ~2.5” x 3.5”).  \n- **Coat**: Structured, with broad shoulders (trapezoidal shape) and a collar that curves upward on the right side.  \n- **Gloves**: Fitted, with segmented fingers (visible creases for realism).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **high-contrast** and dramatic, with saturated accents (purple, green) against neutral tones (white, black, gray). Textures are varied to add realism:  \n\n| Element               | Color (Hex/RGB)               | Texture/Visual Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Hair**              | #9ACD32 (pale green) + #F0E68C (yellow) + #8B4513 (brown roots) | Wavy, unkempt, with loose strands. Mix of matte (roots) and shiny (ends) textures. |\n| **Face Makeup**       | #F0E6D6 (off-white base) + #000000 (black eye shadow) + #FF3333 (red cheeks/lips) | Caked, smudged white base; black eye makeup extends to temples (blurred edges); red is uneven (smudged at mouth corners). |\n| **Eyes**              | #654321 (brown irises) + #000000 (pupils) | Small, intense pupils; subtle catchlights (white highlights) in the upper-left of each eye. |\n| **Teeth**             | #D4AF37 (yellow gold) + #8B4513 (stains) | Yellowed, with visible enamel cracks and minor stains (especially on incisors).     |\n| **Coat**              | #4B0082 (dark purple)         | Glossy leather texture, with light reflecting off the shoulders and collar.         |\n| **Gloves**            | #800080 (purple)              | Shiny, smooth leather; creases at the knuckles and finger joints.                   |\n| **Shirt**             | #2F4F4F (dark gray) + #D3D3D3 (checkerboard pattern) | Fine checkerboard pattern (1:1 black/white ratio) on the collar and cuffs.          |\n| **Card**              | #FFFFFF (white base) + #000000 (text/line art) + #FF0000 (blood) | Matte white background; black outline for the Joker figure; red blood splatter on the left side. |\n| **Joker Figure (Card)**| #800080 (purple coat) + #FFD700 (yellow waistcoat) + #FFFFFF (shirt) | Flat, cartoonish style (contrast with the character’s realism). The figure’s face is pale (#F0E6D6), with a wide grin. |\n| **Background**        | #444444 (mid-gray) + #000000 (black) | Radial blur (center in focus, edges soft); gradient from light gray (top-left) to black (bottom-right). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **shallow depth of field** to isolate the character from the background. Key spatial cues:  \n\n- **Character**:占据 80% of the frame, centered horizontally. The head is tilted slightly toward the card (left side of the frame).  \n- **Card**: Held in the **left hand** (viewer’s left) at chest height, ~6 inches from the face. The card is angled 30° from vertical (top toward the character’s cheek), with the top-left corner (bearing the “JOKER” text) closest to the camera.  \n- **Hand/Glove**: The thumb is on the **back** of the card, and the index/middle fingers wrap around the **front** (bottom edge of the card). The glove’s fingers are slightly curled, creating a relaxed but intentional grip.  \n- **Background**: Blurred, with the top-left corner showing a faint, light-gray horizontal surface (likely a ceiling) and the bottom-right fading to black. The blur is **radial**—sharpest at the character’s eyes and the card, softest at the frame edges.  \n- **Lighting**: Key light from the **left front**, casting a soft shadow on the right side of the face (cheek/jaw). The card is lit from the same angle, making the Joker figure and text highly visible.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph** with stylized, dramatic makeup and a cinematic aesthetic. Key artistic choices:  \n\n- **Depth of Field**: Extreme shallow focus (f/2.8 or wider) to prioritize the face and card, minimizing background distraction.  \n- **Lighting**: High-contrast “Rembrandt lighting” (triangle of light on the right cheek) to enhance facial structure and create a menacing mood.  \n- **Texture Contrast**: Smooth leather (coat/gloves) vs. rough, unkempt hair; caked makeup vs. shiny card—adds visual interest and reinforces the character’s chaotic persona.  \n- **Color Harmony**: Purple (coat/gloves) and green (hair) are complementary colors, creating a vibrant yet unsettling balance. The white/black/red makeup mimics a clown’s palette but with a grotesque twist.  \n- **Emotional Tone**: The character’s wide, uneven smile (accentuated by red lip makeup) and intense eye contact create a sense of unease. The card’s macabre design (severed head) reinforces the Joker’s violent identity.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nEvery small detail contributes to the character’s iconic look. For SVG accuracy, note:  \n\n#### **Joker Card** (Critical for Reproduction):\n- **Text**: *“JOKER”* in bold, black serif font at the **top-left corner** (12pt size) and **bottom-right corner** (8pt size).  \n- **Figure**: A humanoid Joker in a purple tailcoat, yellow waistcoat, white ruffled shirt, and purple pants. The figure stands on a white base, holding a **staff** in the right hand (topped with a ball) and a **severed head** in the left hand (brown hair, pale face, red blood splatter on the card).  \n- **Blood Splatter**: Red (#FF0000) splotch on the left side of the card, near the severed head. The splatter has irregular edges, mimicking a spray.  \n\n#### **Face Makeup** (Smudges and Imperfections):\n- **Black Eye Makeup**: Extends 1.5 inches past the outer corners of the eyes, with a “wing” shape. The edges are smudged (1–2mm blur) to look worn.  \n- **Red Cheek/Lip Makeup**: Applied in a “triangle” shape from the corners of the mouth to the cheekbones. The lips are overdrawn (1mm beyond natural lip line) and smudged at the corners.  \n- **White Base**: Caked in the T-zone (forehead/nose) and thinner on the cheeks, revealing subtle skin texture (pores, wrinkles).  \n\n#### **Hair**:\n- **Strands**: 5–10 loose, wavy strands frame the face (left side: 3 strands, right side: 2 strands). The top of the hair is styled in a messy “quiff” (volume at the crown).  \n- **Color Gradient**: Roots are brown (#8B4513), fading to green (#9ACD32) at the mid-lengths, and yellow (#F0E68C) at the ends.  \n\n#### **Coat/Shirt**:\n- **Shoulder Pads**: Visible on both shoulders, adding bulk to the silhouette.  \n- **Collar**: The right collar is upturned (1 inch from the neck), while the left collar lies flat.  \n- **Shirt**: The dark gray checkered pattern (1mm squares) is visible at the collar and cuffs.  \n\n\n### **6. Critical SVG Notes for Accuracy**\nTo recreate the image as an SVG, prioritize these vector-friendly details:  \n\n- **Card**: Use a **rectangle** for the base, with a **clipping path** to mask the Joker figure (ensure the severed head and blood splatter are distinct layers). The “JOKER” text should be a **text element** (not outlines) for editability.  \n- **Hair**: Use **bezier curves** to trace the wavy strands, with gradient fills (#9ACD32 → #F0E68C) and subtle stroke effects (1px black) to add texture.  \n- **Makeup**: For the black eye shadow, use a **radial gradient** (#000000 → transparent) to mimic smudging. The red cheek/lip makeup should be a **soft brush stroke** (vector mask with feathered edges).  \n- **Gloves**: Trace the finger contours with **rounded rectangles**, adding a **specular highlight** (white ellipse) on the knuckles to mimic leather shine.  \n- **Background**: Use a **radial gradient** (#444444 → #000000) with a **blur filter** (SVG `feGaussianBlur`) to replicate the shallow depth of field.  \n- **Lighting**: Add a **white ellipse** (low opacity, 20%) on the left side of the face and card to simulate the key light. Use **drop shadows** (SVG `feDropShadow`) on the card and hair to enhance depth.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will capture the image’s dramatic mood, realistic textures, and iconic character design.",
  "v1_171": "To accurately recreate this black-and-white image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, shapes, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details**—with a focus on geometric precision, proportions, and layout critical for vector reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **portrait of a seated man** in a formal setting, with a focus on his upper body. Key objects include:  \n- **The Man**: Central focal point, occupying ~70% of the frame. His figure includes:  \n  - **Head**: Oval shape with a receding hairline (straight across the forehead, slight side part to the right).  \n  - **Torso**: Clad in a tailored jacket with padded shoulders, a notched collar, and long sleeves.  \n  - **Arms/Hands**: Resting clasped on a table (right hand atop left hand, right thumb slightly protruding).  \n  - **Clothing**: A crisp white dress shirt, a narrow black tie, and a light-colored jacket.  \n  - **Accessories**: A ring on the **left hand’s index finger** and a watch on the **left wrist** (under the jacket sleeve).  \n- **Background Elements**:  \n  - **Door**: Left third of the background, paneled with a rectangular top section holding a sign.  \n  - **Sign**: Rectangular, mounted on the door’s top panel, with a stylized logo (arch/triangle) and text (*\"MWS\"*).  \n  - **Wall**: Right two-thirds of the background, with **wainscoting** (lower paneled section) and a **chair rail** (horizontal molding separating lower/upper walls).  \n  - **Chair**: Wooden backrest visible behind the man’s right shoulder (partial, rectangular with slatted details).  \n  - **Table**: Foreground, bottom edge of the frame, supporting the man’s hands.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is **high-contrast black-and-white**, with tones ranging from pure white to deep black. Critical tonal relationships:  \n- **Light Areas**:  \n  - Jacket (light gray, nearly white) with subtle texture (herringbone/tweed, visible in shadows).  \n  - Shirt (white, crisp and smooth).  \n  - Sign background (pale gray, matte).  \n  - Table (white, reflective edge).  \n- **Dark Areas**:  \n  - Tie (black, glossy).  \n  - Hair (black, short and dense).  \n  - Door (deep gray, wooden grain).  \n  - Chair back (dark gray, slatted texture).  \n  - Watch strap (dark gray, leather).  \n- **Mid-Tones**:  \n  - Wall paneling (medium gray, matte).  \n  - Jacket shadows (soft gray, defining padding and fit).  \n  - Facial features (subtle grays for cheeks, forehead, and jawline).  \n\n**Textures**:  \n- **Jacket**: Subtle woven texture (recreate with fine diagonal lines in SVG).  \n- **Tie**: Glossy (use a gradient from black to dark gray for shine).  \n- **Door**: Wooden grain (add thin, irregular lines in dark gray).  \n- **Hair**: Short, spiky texture (use small, angled lines).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **balanced and cinematic**, with the man as the focal point. Key spatial rules:  \n- **Man**:  \n  - Centered horizontally (shoulders span ~60% of the frame width).  \n  - Vertically, his head occupies the top 1/5 of the image; his hands rest in the bottom 1/10 (on the table).  \n  - Body slightly turned to the right (shoulders angled ~15° from the camera), but head faces forward (gaze directed slightly right of center).  \n- **Door**:  \n  - Left background, occupying the left 1/3 of the frame.  \n  - Extends from the top edge to ~50% of the image height.  \n  - Sign is mounted on the door’s **top panel** (rectangular, ~40% of the door’s height, centered horizontally on the panel).  \n- **Wall Paneling**:  \n  - Right background, spanning the right 2/3 of the frame.  \n  - Chair rail (horizontal molding) runs at ~60% of the image height (separating lower paneled wall from upper smooth wall).  \n  - Lower wall has 3 rectangular panels (each ~15% of the frame height, spaced evenly).  \n- **Chair**:  \n  - Behind the man’s right shoulder, occupying the right 1/4 of the frame.  \n  - Backrest extends from ~50% of the image height to the bottom edge.  \n- **Table**:  \n  - Foreground, bottom edge of the frame (10% of the image height).  \n  - Man’s hands rest on the table’s left half.  \n\n**Proportions**:  \n- **Head**: Oval, 1:1.5 ratio (width:height).  \n- **Jacket Shoulders**: Padded, 2x wider than the head (shoulder span ~30% of the frame width).  \n- **Tie**: 1:6 ratio (width:height), hanging from the collar to the jacket’s third button.  \n- **Sign**: 1:2 ratio (width:height), positioned 1/3 from the top of the door.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **classic mid-20th-century Hollywood headshot** (1940s–1950s), with:  \n- **Dramatic Lighting**: Key light from the **left front**, creating sharp shadows on the right side of the man’s face (jawline, neck) and highlighting his left cheekbone.  \n- **Shallow Depth of Field**: Background (door, wall) is softly focused (recreate in SVG with reduced contrast and lighter mid-tones).  \n- **Tailored Fashion**: Jacket with **padded shoulders** (straight line from neck to shoulder edge, then curving down to the sleeve), **notched collar** (lapels angled at ~45°, with a 1-inch notch where they meet the collar), and **high waist** (jacket hem hits at the hip bone).  \n- **Serious Expression**: Neutral mouth (slight downward curve at corners), deep-set eyes (brows angled upward), and a strong jawline—conveying intensity.  \n\n**SVG Style Notes**:  \n- Use **flat shapes** for large areas (jacket, door) but add **subtle gradients** for depth (e.g., jacket shoulders: light gray at the edge, darker gray toward the center).  \n- **Clipping masks** to define the man’s hair and facial features (e.g., hair clipped to the head shape, with fine lines for texture).  \n- **Layer order**: Man (top layer) → Table (middle layer) → Background (door, wall, chair) (bottom layer).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Door Sign**:  \n  - **Shape**: Rectangular (1:2 ratio), mounted on the door’s top panel.  \n  - **Logo**: Stylized geometric shape at the top—likely a **curved arch** (or stylized bird) with a horizontal line through the center (recreate as a thin black line with a 10° curve).  \n  - **Text**: *\"MWS\"* (capital letters, serif font) below the logo. Letters are ~1/4 the height of the sign, spaced evenly.  \n- **Ring**: On the man’s **left hand index finger** (visible between the right hand’s thumb and index finger). Shape: Circular, with a thin band (recreate as a 1px black circle).  \n- **Watch**: On the man’s **left wrist** (under the jacket sleeve). Shape: Round face (10px diameter) with a leather strap (rectangular, 3px wide, extending 15px from the face).  \n- **Doorknob**: On the door’s left edge (partially hidden by the man’s arm). Shape: Circular (5px diameter), dark gray.  \n- **Chair Rail**: Horizontal molding on the right wall—1px thick, running from the door’s right edge to the image’s right edge, at ~60% of the image height.  \n\n\n### **6. Critical SVG Layout Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following **proportional grid** (based on a 1000px × 1000px canvas):  \n| Element | Position (X, Y) | Size (Width × Height) |\n|---------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Man’s Head | (500, 150) | 200px × 250px |\n| Jacket Shoulders | (200, 300) to (800, 300) | 600px × 400px |\n| Table | (0, 900) | 1000px × 100px |\n| Door | (0, 0) | 300px × 600px |\n| Sign | (50, 50) | 200px × 100px |\n| Chair Back | (700, 500) | 300px × 500px |\n\n**Facial Features**:  \n- **Eyes**: Oval (15px × 8px), spaced 30px apart. Pupils (5px circles) positioned 2px from the top of the eye (giving a \"looking up\" gaze).  \n- **Eyebrows**: Angular (20px long, 2px thick), curved upward at the outer edges (aligned with the top of the eyes).  \n- **Mouth**: Rectangular (30px × 5px), with a 5° downward curve at the corners (centered below the nose).  \n- **Nose**: Triangular (15px × 10px), with a straight bridge (aligned with the center of the eyes).  \n\n**Hair**:  \n- **Shape**: Short, with a side part (left side combed over to the right). Recreate as a series of small, angled lines (5px long, 1px thick) clipped to the head shape.  \n- **Sideburns**: Short (10px long), extending from the hairline to the bottom of the ear.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Reproduction**\nTo recreate this image accurately, prioritize:  \n- **Geometric precision** for clothing (jacket collar, tie shape) and background elements (door, sign).  \n- **Tonal contrast** (light vs. dark) to mimic the black-and-white effect.  \n- **Layer order** (man on top, background on bottom) to maintain depth.  \n- **Subtle textures** (jacket weave, door grain) to add realism without overwhelming the vector style.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, you’ll create an SVG that captures the cinematic mood, formal attire, and spatial layout of the original image.",
  "v1_172": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, colors/textures, spatial relationships, style, and specific details**—with a focus on geometric precision, proportions, and layout cues necessary for vector reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a cinematic still set in a large, industrial-style indoor space (likely a warehouse or community hall) with a crowd gathered for an event. Key elements include:  \n- **Foreground Subject**: A tall man standing at the left third of the frame,占据 ~40% of the width. He wears a **single-breasted suit** (2 buttons at the waist, 3 cuff buttons on each sleeve) and clasps his hands at chest level (fingers interlaced, left hand over right).  \n  - **Suit Details**: Left breast pocket with a **pocket square**; right lower pocket with a **rectangular object** (e.g., a notebook or card) protruding.  \n  - **Hands**: Left hand has a **ring** on the third finger; fingers are slightly curled, holding a small, indistinct object (possibly a piece of paper or token).  \n- **Middle Ground**: Two figures standing behind the foreground subject:  \n  - **Woman (Center)**: Facing forward, holding a **large, bundled object** (likely flowers or a cloth) against her chest. Her hair is styled in an updo with loose strands.  \n  - **Man (Right)**: Standing rigidly, wearing a **darker suit** with **medals** (3–4 small, distinct shapes) on his chest. He has round glasses and a receding hairline.  \n- **Background**: A **crowd of 10–15 people** (blurred to indicate depth) filling the lower third of the frame. Behind them:  \n  - **Walls**: Vertical wooden planks (left side) and a sloped ceiling with **grid-patterned windows** (top right) letting in diffused light.  \n  - **Structural Elements**: A horizontal beam running across the ceiling, supporting the sloped roof; a rectangular window (top right) with a metal frame.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is **black-and-white**, with a **high-contrast cinematic palette** (typical of mid-20th-century film):  \n- **Foreground Subject**: His suit is a **medium gray** with a subtle herringbone texture (visible in the light). His face and hands are well-lit, with soft shadows defining his jawline and the folds of his suit.  \n- **Middle Ground Figures**:  \n  - The woman’s bundle is a **light gray** with a patterned texture (e.g., floral or checkered). Her dress is a darker gray, contrasting with the bundle.  \n  - The man with medals wears a **dark gray suit** (near-black) with a matte texture. His medals are slightly lighter, creating subtle highlights.  \n- **Background**:  \n  - Walls: **Dark gray** wooden planks with a rough, grainy texture.  \n  - Windows: **Light gray** grid patterns (rectangular panes) with soft, diffused light coming through—creating a gradient from light (center) to dark (edges).  \n  - Crowd: **Mid-gray** silhouettes, blurred to indicate depth (shallow depth of field).  \n- **Lighting**: The main subject is lit from the **top-left**, creating a catchlight in his eyes and highlighting the texture of his suit. The background is darker, with the windows providing a soft backlight.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **leading lines** (from the ceiling and walls) to draw attention to the main subject. Key depth cues include:  \n- **Foreground**: The main man stands slightly turned toward the right, with his hands clasped at chest level (his left hand is closer to the camera). His head is tilted slightly downward, and his eyes are focused on the crowd.  \n- **Middle Ground**:  \n  - The woman is centered behind the main man, standing about 1.5x his height away. Her bundle is held at shoulder level, and her face is partially obscured by the main man’s arm.  \n  - The man with medals is on the **right third** of the frame, standing parallel to the main man. He is slightly shorter (about 80% of the main man’s height) and positioned behind the woman.  \n- **Background**: The crowd fills the lower third of the frame, with individuals standing in rows. The closest members of the crowd are blurred but distinguishable (e.g., a person with short hair on the left, a person with a hat on the right).  \n- **Ceiling/Walls**: The sloped ceiling runs from the top right to the middle left, creating a diagonal line that guides the eye toward the main subject. The wooden walls on the left are vertical, contrasting with the horizontal ceiling beams.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **cinematic still** (likely from a historical drama), with the following stylistic traits:  \n- **High Contrast**: Dramatic lighting separates the main subject from the background, a hallmark of film noir or period dramas.  \n- **Shallow Depth of Field**: The main subject is in sharp focus, while the middle ground (woman and man with medals) is slightly blurred, and the background crowd is heavily blurred—creating a sense of hierarchy.  \n- **Composition**: The main subject is placed on the **rule of thirds** (left third), with the secondary subjects balancing the right third. The ceiling’s sloped structure creates a **triangular composition** (from the main man’s head to the windows to the crowd), guiding the eye upward.  \n- **Texture Contrast**: The main man’s textured suit contrasts with the smooth, matte texture of the man with medals’ suit, and the rough wooden walls contrast with the soft, patterned bundle.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Main Man**:  \n  - **Ring**: A small, circular ring on his left third finger (visible on the back of his hand).  \n  - **Pocket Square**: A folded square of fabric in his left breast pocket (matches the color of his dress shirt).  \n  - **Rectangular Object**: A thin, rectangular item (e.g., a notebook or ID card) protruding from his right lower pocket (about 1/3 the height of the pocket).  \n- **Man with Medals**:  \n  - **Medals**: 3–4 small, distinct shapes on his chest (e.g., a circular medal, a rectangular ribbon). They are positioned on the left side of his suit, just below his tie.  \n  - **Glasses**: Round, wire-rimmed glasses with a slight reflection (visible on the left lens).  \n- **Woman**:  \n  - **Bundle**: A large, irregularly shaped bundle (about the size of her upper body) held with both hands. The texture suggests it could be flowers, a blanket, or a piece of fabric.  \n  - **Hair**: An updo with loose strands framing her face (visible on the left side).  \n- **Background**:  \n  - **Windows**: A grid of 12–15 rectangular panes (arranged in 3 rows of 4–5) on the sloped ceiling. The panes are separated by thin, dark lines (metal frames).  \n  - **Walls**: Vertical wooden planks (about 10–12 planks visible) with a rough, uneven texture. The planks are darker at the edges, creating a shadow effect.  \n\n\n### **Key Geometric and Proportional Details for SVG**\nTo ensure accurate reproduction, note these measurements (relative to the main man’s height, which is 100%):  \n- **Main Man**:  \n  - Height: 100% (from feet to top of head—feet are not visible in the image).  \n  - Shoulder width: 30% of his height.  \n  - Hand size: Each hand is 10% of his height (clasped hands are 15% of his height).  \n  - Suit buttons: 2 buttons at the waist (separated by 5% of his height) and 3 cuff buttons (separated by 2% of his height).  \n- **Middle Ground Figures**:  \n  - Woman’s height: 85% of the main man’s height.  \n  - Man with medals’ height: 80% of the main man’s height.  \n- **Background Elements**:  \n  - Window grid: Each pane is 5% of the main man’s height (width) and 7% of his height (height). The grid is positioned 15% of the main man’s height from the top of the frame.  \n  - Wooden planks: Each plank is 8% of the main man’s height (width) and 100% of the background height (from the crowd to the ceiling).  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\n- **Focus**: The main man is the focal point—ensure his suit texture, hand position, and facial features (shadow, catchlight) are accurate.  \n- **Depth**: Use blur (via opacity or Gaussian blur effects) on the middle ground and background to replicate the shallow depth of field.  \n- **Lighting**: Add a gradient to the windows (light center, dark edges) and use soft shadows on the main man’s face and suit to mimic the top-left lighting.  \n- **Textures**: Use pattern fills (herringbone for the main man’s suit, grainy for the walls) and matte fills (for the man with medals’ suit) to replicate the film’s texture.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately recreate the cinematic still’s composition, lighting, and atmosphere.",
  "v1_173": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description of its elements, focusing on geometry, proportions, textures, and spatial relationships:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a cinematic scene set in a rural, mountainous landscape. The primary focus is **five humanoid figures** (plus one partial figure in the background) and **two horses**, arranged in front of a **thatched-roof hut** and a **stone wall**. Key objects include:  \n- **Foreground Figures (Left to Right)**:  \n  1. **Blonde-Haired Figure**: Standing, long straight blonde hair, wearing a layered brown tunic with a cloak, holding a quiver of arrows.  \n  2. **Central White-Robed Figure**: Tall, dominant, wearing a floor-length white robe, holding a curved staff with a silver ornament.  \n  3. **Brown-Haired Figure**: Standing, long wavy brown hair, wearing a black leather outfit, holding a sword.  \n  4. **Horse-Riding Figure**: Seated on a dark horse, wearing a helmet and cloak, holding a tall staff.  \n- **Background**:  \n  - **Hut**: A-frame structure with a thatched roof and wooden walls, partially open to reveal a dark interior.  \n  - **Stone Wall**: Stacked rectangular stones running diagonally from the left foreground to the background.  \n  - **Landscape**: Sloped hills with sparse vegetation, a winding gray path, and distant mountains.  \n- **Secondary Elements**:  \n  - **Horses**: One behind the brown-haired figure (partially obscured) and one under the horse-riding figure.  \n  - **Weapons**: Quivers, swords, staffs, and a bow (carried by the blonde-haired figure).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **muted and earthy**, with contrast between the central figure’s bright robe and the dark, textured surroundings. Key colors and textures:  \n- **Central White-Robed Figure**:  \n  - Robe: Pale cream (#f0e6d6) with soft, flowing folds (lightweight fabric texture).  \n  - Staff: Wooden shaft (tan #d2b48c) with a curved silver top (#c0c0c0) and a silver band at the grip.  \n  - Brooch: Silver (#c0c0c0) circular ornament at the neck, possibly with a star or floral motif.  \n- **Blonde-Haired Figure**:  \n  - Tunic/Cloak: Deep brown (#654321) with a rough, woven texture; cloak lined with gray (#808080).  \n  - Quiver: Leather (#8b4513) with gold (#ffd700) decorative patterns; arrows have brown shafts and feathered tips.  \n  - Armor: Black leather (#000000) bracers on forearms.  \n- **Brown-Haired Figure**:  \n  - Outfit: Black leather (#000000) tunic and pants, with a matte finish.  \n  - Sword: Silver (#c0c0c0) blade in a black sheath at the hip.  \n- **Horse-Riding Figure**:  \n  - Armor: Silver (#c0c0c0) helmet with a nose guard; chainmail (#808080) under a dark green (#006400) cloak.  \n  - Horse: Black (#000000) mane and coat, with a brown (#8b4513) harness.  \n- **Hut**:  \n  - Roof: Layered thatch in shades of brown (#a0522d) and tan (#d2b48c), with a rough, bristly texture.  \n  - Walls: Weathered wood (#8b4513) with deep grooves and a dark gray (#404040) trim.  \n- **Stone Wall**:  \n  - Stones: Gray (#808080) with mossy green (#2e8b57) and dirt (#a0522d) accents; rough, uneven surfaces.  \n- **Landscape**:  \n  - Hills: Muted green (#6b8e23) and brown (#a0522d) with sparse, dark gray (#404040) bushes.  \n  - Path: Gray (#808080) with loose stones and dirt, winding through the hills.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centrally focused** on the white-robed figure, with a diagonal flow from the left stone wall to the right hut. Key spatial dynamics:  \n- **Foreground**:  \n  - The **central white-robed figure** stands at the intersection of two stone walls, making him the visual anchor. He is flanked by:  \n    - **Left**: Blonde-haired figure (1.5x his width, standing 0.8x his height) holding the quiver across his chest.  \n    - **Right**: Brown-haired figure (1.2x his width, standing 0.9x his height) with a sword at his hip.  \n  - **Right**: Horse-riding figure is elevated on a horse, positioned to the right of the hut. The horse’s head is level with the hut’s doorway.  \n- **Background**:  \n  - **Hut**: A-frame structure占据 the right third of the image, with its apex pointing upward. The doorway reveals a partial figure (behind the brown-haired figure) and a horse (partially obscured by the hut’s wall).  \n  - **Stone Wall**: Runs from the left foreground (near the blonde-haired figure’s feet) diagonally to the background, creating a “pathway” that guides the eye toward the central figure.  \n- **Depth**:  \n  - The landscape recedes into the distance, with the winding path becoming smaller and lighter (#d3d3d3) as it ascends the hills.  \n  - The hut’s interior is dark (#202020), contrasting with the brighter exterior, emphasizing depth.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **realistic, cinematic style** with a focus on texture and natural lighting. Key artistic choices:  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the left, casting gentle shadows on the right sides of figures and objects. The central figure’s white robe catches the light, making him the focal point.  \n- **Texture Contrast**: Smooth leather (black outfit) vs. rough thatch (hut) vs. flowing fabric (white robe) creates visual interest.  \n- **Composition**: Rule of thirds is used loosely, with the central figure at the intersection of the left third and center. The stone wall and hut frame the figures, creating a “vignette” effect.  \n- **Realism**: Detailed textures (e.g., fabric folds, leather grain, thatch layers) and natural proportions (e.g., human height relative to stone wall) contribute to a lifelike feel.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Symbols, Weapons, and Props)**\nThese details are critical for accurate SVG reproduction:  \n- **Central White-Robed Figure**:  \n  - Staff: Curved at the top (15° angle) with a silver ornament (diameter ~5cm) and a silver band (width ~2cm) at the grip.  \n  - Brooch: Circular (diameter ~4cm) with a raised design (possibly a star or floral motif) at the neck of the robe.  \n  - Hands: Grip the staff at waist height; fingers are visible through the robe’s folds.  \n- **Blonde-Haired Figure**:  \n  - Quiver: Attached to a leather strap across his chest; the quiver’s top is flared (10° angle), holding 8–10 arrows (feathers are brown #8b4513 and white #ffffff).  \n  - Bow: Rested on his left shoulder (partially obscured by the quiver).  \n- **Brown-Haired Figure**:  \n  - Sword: Sheathed at his left hip; the hilt is silver (#c0c0c0) with a black (#000000) grip.  \n  - Ring: Silver (#c0c0c0) on his right hand (visible as he holds the sword’s hilt).  \n- **Horse-Riding Figure**:  \n  - Staff: Tall (extending from the horse’s back to above the figure’s head) with a straight shaft and a small silver ornament at the top.  \n  - Helmet: Conical shape with a nose guard (extending 3cm below the chin) and a strap under the chin.  \n- **Hut**:  \n  - Thatch: Layered in horizontal rows, with loose strands hanging from the edges.  \n  - Wooden Walls: Vertical planks with gaps between them, revealing darkness inside.  \n- **Horses**:  \n  - Behind Brown-Haired Figure: Brown (#8b4513) coat, partially obscured by the figure’s body. Only the head (with a black (#000000) mane) and front legs are visible.  \n  - Horse-Riding Figure’s Horse: Black (#000000) coat with a brown (#8b4513) harness. The horse’s head is turned slightly to the left, with ears pricked forward.  \n- **Background Figure**:  \n  - Standing in the hut’s doorway: Partial figure (shoulders and head) with short brown hair, wearing a brown (#654321) tunic. Visible only behind the brown-haired figure’s right shoulder.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Geometry**\nFor SVG scaling, use the **central white-robed figure** as the reference (set his height to 100 units for consistency):  \n- **Central Figure**: Height = 100 units, Width = 35 units (robe flares at the bottom to 45 units).  \n- **Blonde-Haired Figure**: Height = 85 units, Width = 30 units (quiver adds 10 units to his width).  \n- **Brown-Haired Figure**: Height = 90 units, Width = 32 units (sword adds 5 units to his width).  \n- **Horse-Riding Figure**: Height (on horse) = 110 units, Width = 35 units (horse adds 20 units to his width).  \n- **Hut**: Height = 120 units (apex), Width = 80 units (base).  \n- **Stone Wall**: Height = 20 units (foreground), Width = 150 units (runs diagonally).  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\n- **Focal Point**: Central white-robed figure with a silver brooch and curved staff.  \n- **Key Shapes**: A-frame hut (triangle), stacked stone wall (rectangles), flowing robe (organic curves).  \n- **Textures**: Rough thatch, smooth leather, flowing fabric, weathered wood.  \n- **Colors**: Muted earth tones with a bright white robe for contrast.  \n- **Layout**: Diagonal stone wall guiding the eye to the central figure, with figures arranged in a semi-circle.  \n\nBy prioritizing these details, the SVG will accurately reflect the image’s cinematic realism and composition.",

Below are specific values and cues:\n\n#### **Foreground (Sharp Focus)**\n- **Hair**: Deep black (#000000) with subtle blue-gray highlights (#2a2a38) for shine. Texture: Smooth, straight (no flyaways).  \n- **Skin**: Warm beige (#f0d0b8) with:  \n  - **Shadows**: Cool gray (#8a7a6f) on the right side of the face/neck.  \n  - **Highlights**: Pale yellow (#fff3e0) on the left cheek, bridge of the nose, and inner corners of the eyes.  \n- **Shirt**: Bright white (#ffffff) with a crisp woven texture (visible seams/wrinkles at the cuffs and collar).  \n- **Milkshake**:  \n  - **Glass**: Matte white (#f5f5f5).  \n  - **Whipped Cream**: Pale yellowish-white (#fff3e0) with a smooth, creamy texture.  \n  - **Cherry**: Bright red (#ff0000) with a shiny finish.  \n  - **Straw**: Clear (#e0e0e0) with slight reflectivity.  \n- **Cigarette**:  \n  - **Filter**: Tan (#d2b48c).  \n  - **Paper**: Dark brown (#654321).  \n- **Nails**: Dark red (#8b0000) (glossy, rounded tips).  \n- **Ring**: Gold (#ffd700) with a small rectangular stone (#ffffff) (subtle shine, not prominent).  \n\n#### **Background (Blurred)**\n- **Purple Shirt**: Medium purple (#800080) with low opacity (~50%) for blur.  \n- **Dark Shirt**: Black (#000000) or deep blue (#1a1a2e) with low opacity (~40%).  \n- **Overall**: Soft, desaturated tones to avoid distracting from the foreground.  \n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Key Light**: From the **left front**, creating:  \n  - **Highlights**: On the left cheek, nose, and left eye (adds depth to the face).  \n  - **Shadows**: On the right side of the face (under the cheekbone, jawline) and neck (adds drama).  \n- **Hair Highlights**: Pale gray (#d3d3d3) on the left side of the bob to emphasize shine.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout uses **depth of field** (sharp foreground, blurred background) and **rule of thirds** (figure’s eyes at intersection points) to guide the viewer’s eye. Below are critical spatial notes:\n\n#### **Foreground Hierarchy**\n- **Central Figure**: Occupies 80% of the frame (head in the upper center, body in the lower center).  \n- **Milkshake**: Lower center (~1/4 from the bottom of the frame), positioned on an implied table (base hidden).  \n- **Cigarette**: Left upper quadrant (hand raised to shoulder height, ~1/3 from the left edge).  \n\n#### **Midground**\n- **Car Trim**: Straight horizontal line (behind the head, at the level of the top of the ears) that spans the entire frame. Acts as a “divider” between the foreground (figure) and background (blurred people).  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Purple Figure**: Right of the car trim (larger, more prominent) to balance the left-side cigarette.  \n- **Dark Figure**: Left of the car trim (smaller) to avoid overcrowding the frame.  \n\n#### **Proportions**\n- **Head**: ~1/3 of the frame’s height (720px frame → ~240px head height).  \n- **Milkshake Glass**: Height ~1/2 of the figure’s upper body (e.g., 600px figure → 300px glass height).  \n- **Cigarette**: Length ~1/2 of the left hand (e.g., 100px hand → 50px cigarette).  \n- **Ring**: ~0.5 inches in diameter (fits the ring finger, small stone to avoid overwhelming the hand).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **cinematic still** with a **neo-noir** aesthetic (dramatic lighting, color contrast). Key style notes for SVG:\n\n#### **Depth of Field**\n- **Foreground**: Sharp edges (figure, milkshake, cigarette) to emphasize detail.  \n- **Background**: Gaussian blur (radius ~5–10px) to simulate a camera’s shallow depth of field.  \n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Chiaroscuro**: Use **gradients** (linear or radial) for shadows (right face/neck) and highlights (left cheek/nose) to replicate the dramatic side lighting.  \n- **Hair**: Use a **radial gradient** (black to blue-gray) for the bob to add volume and shine.  \n\n#### **Texture Variation**\n- **Smooth**: Hair, skin, milkshake cream (use solid colors with subtle gradients).  \n- **Crisp**: Shirt (use vector lines for seams/wrinkles, e.g., cuffs, collar).  \n- **Glossy**: Cherry, nails (use highlights to simulate reflectivity).  \n\n#### **Color Psychology**\n- **Warm Foreground**: White shirt, beige skin, red nails/cherry—evokes intimacy and focus.  \n- **Cool Background**: Purples, blues—evokes distance and ambiguity (matches the movie’s tense tone).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThe image is **text-free** but uses **iconic symbols** (cigarette + milkshake) to define Mia Wallace’s character. Below are critical details for accuracy:\n\n#### **Symbols**\n- **Cigarette**: Represents rebellion/coolness (Mia’s edgy personality).  \n- **Milkshake**: Represents innocence/nostalgia (contrast to her rebellious side).  \n- **Combination**: The clash of these symbols is key to Mia’s complexity—ensure they are prominent in the SVG.  \n\n#### **Jewelry**\n- **Ring**: Gold band (#ffd700) on the **right hand’s ring finger** (third finger from the thumb). Add a small rectangular stone (#ffffff) to the center (subtle, not oversized).  \n\n#### **Nails**\n- **Dark Red Polish**: (#8b0000) on both hands. Tips are **rounded** (not square) and neatly manicured.  \n\n#### **Shirt Details**\n- **Top Button**: Unbuttoned (collar open) to show a sliver of skin.  \n- **Cuffs**: Buttoned (small button visible on the left cuff—use a tiny circle (#000000) for the button).  \n\n#### **Milkshake Details**\n- **Cherry**: Centrally placed on the whipped cream (not off-center).  \n- **Straw**: Angled to the right (end near the glass’s edge) to avoid covering the cherry.  \n\n#### **Cigarette Details**\n- **Filter**: Held by the **thumb and index finger** (not the middle finger).  \n- **Tip**: Upward (unlit—no smoke or glowing embers).  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Figures**: Indistinct (no facial features, just color and shape) to keep the focus on Mia. Use **low opacity** (~40–50%) to make them feel “far away.”  \n\n\n### **Key SVG Technical Notes**\nTo replicate the image’s cinematic style and accuracy, follow these geometric/layout rules:\n\n#### **Hair**\n- **Bangs**: Draw as a **straight horizontal rectangle** (across the forehead, ~1–2 inches long). Use a **rounded edge** at the ends to avoid a “blocky” look.  \n- **Bob**: Draw as a **rounded shape** (shoulder-length) with the ends **curved inward** (not straight). Add subtle highlights (#d3d3d3) on the left side for shine.  \n\n#### **Face**\n- **Eyes**: Almond-shaped (left eye more lit, right eye in shadow). Use **gradients** (light to dark) for depth.  \n- **Nose**: Straight line (from forehead to lips) with a small circle (#f0d0b8) for the tip.  \n- **Lips**: Slightly parted (upper lip thinner than lower). Use **dark red** (#8b0000) for lipstick, with a subtle highlight (#fff3e0) on the lower lip.  \n\n#### **Milkshake**\n- **Glass**: Draw as a **straight cylinder** (white) with a **flat base** (hidden by the table).  \n- **Whipped Cream**: Draw as a **dome shape** (top of the glass) with a **smooth gradient** (pale yellow to white) for creaminess.  \n- **Cherry**: Draw as a **circle** (#ff0000) with a **curved line** (#8b0000) for the stem.  \n\n#### **Car Trim**\n- **Line**: Draw as a **straight horizontal path** (#4a4a4a) (thickness ~2px) behind the head. Use **low opacity** (~70%) to make it feel like part of the car, not a separate element.  \n\n#### **Shadows/Highlights**\n- **Face**: Use **linear gradients** (cool gray to warm beige) for shadows on the right side. Use **radial gradients** (pale yellow to transparent) for highlights on the left cheek.  \n- **Hair**: Use **radial gradients** (black to blue-gray) for shine on the left side of the bob.  \n\n#### **Blurriness**\n- **Background Figures**: Use **Gaussian blur** (radius ~5–10px) to simulate shallow depth of field. Adjust opacity (~40–50%) to make them feel “out of focus.”  \n\n\n### **Final Checklist for Accuracy**\nBefore finalizing the SVG, verify these critical elements:\n1. **Hair**: Bangs straight across, bob shoulder-length with curved ends.  \n2. **Ring**: On the right hand’s ring finger (gold with small stone).  \n3. **Nails**: Dark red, rounded tips (both hands).  \n4. **Milkshake**: Cherry central, straw angled right.  \n5. **Cigarette**: Filter held by thumb/index finger, tip upward.  \n6. **Lighting**: Side lighting (left highlights, right shadows).  \n7. **Background**: Indistinct figures (cool tones, low opacity).  \n8. **Shirt**: Top button unbuttoned, cuffs buttoned.  \n\nBy following this detailed breakdown, the SVG will accurately replicate the iconic *Pulp Fiction* still—preserving Mia Wallace’s character, the cinematic style, and the image’s visual impact.",
  "v1_175": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a comprehensive breakdown of its elements, structured to prioritize precision for vector-based reproduction:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **cinematic close-up** (from *The Lord of the Rings*) featuring three primary layers: a **foreground hand**, a **midground face/figure**, and a **background stone wall**. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground: Hand (Left Hand)**\n- **Structure**: Five fingers, with the **index finger extended straight toward the viewer** (dominant element). The middle, ring, and pinky fingers are slightly curled toward the palm; the thumb is curled under the hand, with only the tip visible.\n- **Ring**: A **simple silver band** placed on the **middle phalanx** of the index finger (1/3 of the way from the base to the tip).\n- **Shape**: Palm is rounded with a slight cup; fingers taper to rounded tips. Knuckles are subtle but defined, especially at the base of the index finger.\n\n#### **Midground: Figure (Frodo Baggins)**\n- **Face**: Oval shape with:\n  - **Eyes**: Wide, almond-shaped, positioned horizontally aligned with the ring.\n  - **Eyebrows**: Curved and raised (expressing tension).\n  - **Mouth**: Slightly open (neutral/concerned expression).\n  - **Hair**: Tight, springy curls framing the top and sides of the face, extending to the top edge of the image.\n- **Clothing**: \n  - **Coat**: Long-sleeved, loose-fitting, with a high collar.

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified as **hex codes** for SVG accuracy. Textures are described to guide pattern/gradient usage.\n\n#### **Hand**\n- **Flesh Tone**: Base = `#f8d7c8` (pale peach); shadows (between fingers, under ring) = `#d1a996` (warm brown).\n- **Sweat**: Glossy sheen on fingertips/palm = `#fff3e0` (pale yellow-white); small droplets on knuckles = `#ffffff` (white) with 50% opacity.\n- **Fingernails**: Short, rounded; base = `#f0c8b8` (pinky-peach); tips = `#ffffff` (white).\n\n#### **Ring**\n- **Base**: `#c0c0c0` (matte silver).\n- **Highlight**: `#e0e0e0` (bright silver) on the top edge (simulating light reflection).\n- **Shadow**: `#a0a0a0` (dark silver) on the bottom edge (under the finger).\n\n#### **Face**\n- **Skin**: Matching the hand (`#f8d7c8`), with flushed cheeks (`#f0a888`).\n- **Eyes**: Irises = `#4a86e8` (bright blue); pupils = `#000000` (black); sclera = `#f0f0f0` (white) with subtle pink tinges (`#f0d0d0`) at the corners.\n- **Eyebrows**: `#2a1a12` (dark brown), curved upward.\n- **Mouth**: Lips = `#d18870` (pale pink); inner mouth = `#804040` (dark pink).\n- **Sweat**: 3–4 droplets on the forehead, 2–3 on the cheeks = `#ffffff` (white) with soft edges (blur filter).\n\n#### **Coat**\n- **Base**: `#6b3e26` (deep brown).\n- **Texture**: Woven wool simulated via a **pattern** (small diagonal lines: `#7a4a30` on a `#6b3e26` background).\n- **Collar**: `#f0e6d6` (pale white, matching the shirt).\n- **Button**: 1 small round button at the collar = `#3b2a1f` (dark brown).\n\n#### **Background Wall**\n- **Base**: `#4a4a4a` (dark gray) with a 10% green tint (`#5a5a50`).\n- **Texture**: Roughness simulated via:\n  - **Irregular paths**: Jagged edges for cracks and indentations.\n  - **Gradient**: Radial gradient from `#3a3a3a` (dark) in the corners to `#5a5a50` (light) in the center (mimicking dim ambient light).\n- **Crack**: Thin, jagged line = `#3a3a3a` (dark gray), starting at the top-right corner and extending 1/3 of the way down the wall.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **foreground dominance** and **linear perspective** to guide the viewer’s eye to the ring. Key proportions:\n- **Hand**: Occupies the **left 40%** of the image. The index finger extends from the left edge to the center; the ring is centered on the index finger (1/3 from the base).\n- **Face**: Centered behind the hand, with the **eyes aligned horizontally** with the ring. The hair frames the top and sides of the face, reaching the top edge of the image.\n- **Coat**: Covers the torso, with the collar framing the lower face. Sleeves hang to the bottom edges of the image (right sleeve is partially visible).\n- **Wall**: Fills the entire background, with the figure leaning forward so the wall curves slightly around the sides (simulated via a radial gradient).\n\n#### **Depth Hierarchy**\n1. **Closest**: Hand (with ring).\n2. **Midground**: Face.\n3. **Background**: Coat → Wall.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image emulates a **cinematic realistic style** (from *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*). Key artistic choices:\n- **Lighting**: \n  - **Warm key light**: Front-left, illuminating the hand, face, and ring (creates strong contrasts with the cool background).\n  - **Cool fill light**: Background wall (dim, gray-green) to deepen the sense of depth.\n- **Depth of Field**: Shallow, but both hand and face remain in focus (hand is larger due to proximity, but no significant blur).\n- **Textural Realism**: \n  - **Skin**: Subtle pores, sweat, and knuckle creases.\n  - **Hair**: Tight curls with volume (via overlapping paths and gradients).\n  - **Coat**: Woven texture (via pattern fills).\n  - **Wall**: Rough, uneven surface (via irregular paths and gradients).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Ring**: Simple, unadorned band (no engravings visible in this angle).\n- **Sweat**: Small, irregular droplets on the forehead (3–4) and cheeks (2–3), with a glossy sheen (use `filter: blur(1px)` for soft edges).\n- **Fingernails**: Short, well-groomed; white tips visible on the index, middle, and ring fingers.\n- **Coat Button**: 1 small round button at the collar (matching the coat’s dark brown color).\n- **Wall Crack**: Thin, jagged line with subtle shadowing (use `filter: drop-shadow(1px 1px 0 #2a2a2a)` to indicate depth).\n\n\n### **SVG-Specific Reproduction Notes**\nTo translate this into a vector image, use **layers**, **patterns**, and **filters** to replicate realism. Key steps:\n1. **Layers**:\n   - **Top**: Hand (with ring).\n   - **Mid**: Face.\n   - **Bottom**: Coat → Background Wall.\n2. **Hand**:\n   - Use **Bezier curves** to define the palm and fingers (organic, rounded shapes).\n   - Add **subtle lines** for knuckles and creases (e.g., `<line>` elements with 20% opacity).\n3. **Hair**:\n   - Use **overlapping curved paths** to simulate curls.\n   - Apply a **linear gradient** (from `#3b2a1f` to `#5a4232`) to add volume.\n4. **Coat**:\n   - Use a **pattern fill** (`<pattern>`) with small diagonal lines (`#7a4a30` on `#6b3e26`) to replicate the woven texture.\n5. **Wall**:\n   - Use **irregular polygon paths** for cracks and indentations.\n   - Apply a **radial gradient** (from `#3a3a3a` to `#5a5a50`) to mimic dim ambient light.\n6. **Lighting**:\n   - **Highlights**: Add `#fff3e0` (pale yellow-white) to the hand’s fingertips and the ring’s top edge.\n   - **Shadows**: Use `filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 4px #2a1a12)` on the hand and face to enhance depth.\n7. **Clip Paths**:\n   - Mask the hair and coat where they overlap with the hand (e.g., `<clipPath>` for the hand’s edges).\n\n\n### **6.

Critical Notes for Accuracy**\n- **Ring Placement**: The ring must be centered on the index finger (1/3 from the base) to match the cinematic composition.\n- **Lighting**: The warm key light from the front-left must create distinct highlights on the hand, ring, and face (use `filter: brightness(1.2)` for these areas).\n- **Texture**: The coat’s woven pattern and the wall’s roughness are essential for realism—avoid flat fills.\n- **Expression**: The face must convey tension (wide eyes, raised eyebrows, slightly open mouth).\n\nThis description provides all the geometric, color, and textural details needed to recreate the image as a precise SVG. The layered structure and vector-specific notes ensure the final product will match the cinematic original.",
  "v1_176": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image (a cinematic still from *The Godfather*), we need to break down the composition into precise geometric shapes, colors, and spatial relationships. Below is a detailed, technical description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on **two foreground figures** in formal attire, with a blurred crowd and a sign in the background. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground Figures**\n- **Man in White Suit (Left)**:  \n  A standing male with short, styled dark hair, a small mustache, and a formal outfit (white suit jacket, white dress shirt, black tie). His head is tilted slightly toward the man in black, and his eyes are fixed on the latter.  \n  - **Shapes**: Oval head, polygon hair, rectangular suit jacket (with lapels), rectangular shirt collar, and a narrow rectangular tie.  \n- **Man in Black Suit (Right)**:  \n  A standing male with short, styled dark hair, clean-shaven, and a formal outfit (black suit jacket, white dress shirt, black tie). He is facing the man in white, with **both arms extended**—his right hand (from the viewer’s perspective) grips the man in white’s left cheek (fingers spread slightly, index finger bearing a ring).  \n  - **Shapes**: Oval head, polygon hair, rectangular suit jacket (with lapels), rectangular shirt collar, narrow rectangular tie, and an oval hand (with four finger ovals and a thumb oval).  \n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Crowd**: Blurred, dynamic figures (out of focus) in the midground. Key individuals include:  \n  - A person with a **red-and-yellow hat** (left background, white shirt).  \n  - A person with a **light blue hat** (middle background, dark jacket over a white dress).  \n  - Generic figures (ovals for heads, rectangles for bodies) in neutral tones (white, black, gray).  \n- **Sign (Top Background)**: A large, curved rectangular banner spanning most of the image width, with red serif text (likely *“PEREZ ANGULO”*, though slightly distorted due to perspective).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is dominated by **high-contrast formal wear** (white vs. black) and warm, muted background tones. Textures are crisp for foreground figures and soft/blurred for the background (cinematic shallow depth of field).\n\n#### **Foreground Figures**\n- **Man in White Suit**:  \n  - Suit jacket: Ivory (#F0E6D6) with a smooth, tailored texture.  \n  - Shirt: Bright white (#FFFFFF), crisp.  \n  - Tie: Jet black (#000000).  \n  - Skin: Warm peach (#FFE0B2) with subtle shadow gradients (darker at the jawline/forehead).  \n  - Hair: Dark brown (#331A00), matte.  \n  - Mustache: Dark brown (#331A00).  \n- **Man in Black Suit**:  \n  - Suit jacket: Jet black (#000000), smooth.  \n  - Shirt: Bright white (#FFFFFF), crisp.  \n  - Tie: Jet black (#000000).  \n  - Skin: Warm peach (#FFE0B2) with subtle shadow gradients.  \n  - Hair: Dark brown (#331A00), matte.  \n  - Ring: Gold (#FFD700), shiny.  \n  - Hand: Warm peach (#FFE0B2), with faint knuckle definition.  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Crowd**: Muted tones (white shirts: #FFFFFF; dark jackets: #202020; blue hat: #ADD8E6; red hat: #FF0000 + #FFFF00). All elements have **low opacity (0.5–0.7)** and **Gaussian blur (stdDeviation: 5–10)** to simulate depth of field.  \n- **Sign**:  \n  - Background: Worn white (#E0E0E0) with a subtle linear gradient (lighter at the top, darker at the bottom) to mimic aging.  \n  - Text: Faded red (#CC0000) with 0.7 opacity to look weathered.  \n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Suits**: Smooth, tailored (solid fills with subtle gradient highlights for depth).  \n- **Shirts**: Crisp (solid white with faint cuff lines).  \n- **Skin**: Warm and slightly textured (subtle gradient shadows to define facial features).  \n- **Background**: Soft and indistinct (blur filters to de-emphasize details).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **shallow depth of field** to focus on the two foreground figures, with the background blurred to draw attention to their interaction. Key spatial cues:\n\n#### **Foreground**\n- **Man in White Suit**: Occupies the **left third** of the image (x: 0–30% of the canvas). His head is at the top third (y: 15–35%), and his body extends to the bottom edge.  \n- **Man in Black Suit**: Occupies the **right two-thirds** of the image (x: 25–100%). His head is at the top third (y: 20–40%), and his body extends to the bottom edge. He is **slightly in front** of the man in white (z-index higher), as his arm overlaps the latter’s shoulder.  \n- **Hand Interaction**: The man in black’s hand is positioned at the **left-center** of the image (x: 10–25%, y: 25–35%), gripping the man in white’s cheek. This is the **visual focal point** of the image.  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Crowd**: Positioned in the **midground** (x: 0–100%, y: 30–100%). Figures are smaller than the foreground figures and spaced randomly, with some overlapping.  \n- **Sign**: Spans the **top background** (x: 0–100%, y: 0–15%). It is centered horizontally and slightly tilted to match the perspective of the room.  \n- **Depth Cues**:  \n  - **Size**: Foreground figures are larger than background figures.  \n  - **Blur**: Background elements have higher blur and lower opacity than foreground elements.  \n  - **Overlap**: The man in black’s arm overlaps the man in white’s shoulder, indicating proximity.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image adheres to **cinematic realism** with a focus on drama and character interaction. Key stylistic choices:\n\n- **Depth of Field**: Shallow (foreground in focus, background blurred) to isolate the two main figures and emphasize their emotional tension.  \n- **Color Grading**: Warm, golden tones (skin, sign) contrasted with cool blacks and whites (suits) to create a nostalgic, 1940s-era mood.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused lighting on the foreground figures (subtle shadows on their faces) with dimmer, warmer lighting in the background (to mimic a crowded, indoor event).  \n- **Composition**: Symmetrical balance between the two figures (left/right split) with the hand interaction as the central anchor. The sign at the top adds context without distracting from the main action.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Ring**: The man in black’s index finger wears a small, round gold ring (x: 12–15%, y: 28–30% of the canvas). This is a critical detail for character recognition.  \n- **Mustache**: The man in white has a thin, dark mustache (x: 18–25%, y: 32–35%) that distinguishes him from the clean-shaven man in black.  \n- **Sign Text**: The banner at the top has red serif text (likely *“PEREZ ANGULO”*) in a large, bold font (font-size: 80–100px relative to the canvas). The text is **slightly distorted** (stretched horizontally) to match the sign’s perspective.  \n- **Cuff Links**: Both men wear white shirt cuffs (visible at the wrists) with subtle button details (small circles).  \n- **Background Activity**: The crowd includes a person smoking (faint gray smoke near the center background) and others talking, adding context to the “event” setting (e.g., a wedding or party).  \n\n\n### **Technical Specifications for SVG Reproduction**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following guidelines for SVG elements:\n\n#### **Coordinate System**\n- Use a **responsive canvas** (e.g., `viewBox=\"0 0 1000 1000\"` for a 1:1 aspect ratio).  \n- Position elements using **relative percentages** (e.g., `x=\"10%\" y=\"20%\"`) to maintain scaling.  \n\n#### **Shapes and Paths**\n- **Heads**: Ovals with rounded edges (e.g., `rx=\"50%\" ry=\"50%\"`).  \n- **Hair**: Polygons with straight edges to mimic styled, short hair (e.g., `points=\"50 150, 200 150, 180 200, 70 200\"` for the man in white).  \n- **Suits**: Rectangles with lapels (add a small polygon to the collar area for lapel definition).  \n- **Hands**: Ovals for palms, small ovals for fingers (e.g., `x=\"120\" y=\"230\" rx=\"40%\" ry=\"60%\"` for the index finger).  \n- **Blur Filters**: Apply `feGaussianBlur` to background elements (e.g., `<filter id=\"blur\"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"8\"/></filter>`).  \n\n#### **Fills and Gradients**\n- **Skin**: Linear gradients to add depth (e.g., ` <linearGradient id=\"skin\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"100%\"><stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#FFE0B2\"/><stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#CC9966\"/></linearGradient>`).  \n- **Suits**: Solid fills with subtle gradient highlights (e.g., ` <linearGradient id=\"white-suit\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"100%\"><stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#F0E6D6\"/><stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#D0C0A0\"/></linearGradient>`).  \n- **Sign**: Linear gradient for the background (e.g., ` <linearGradient id=\"sign-bg\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"100%\"><stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\"/><stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#E0E0E0\"/></linearGradient>`).  \n\n#### **Text**\n- Use a **serif font** (e.g., `font-family=\"Times New Roman\"`) for the sign text.  \n- Add **text distortion** (e.g., `transform=\"scale(1.2, 1)\"`) to mimic the sign’s perspective.  \n- Reduce opacity (e.g., `opacity=\"0.7\"`) to make the text look worn.  \n\n#### **Filters**\n- **Blur**: Apply to all background elements (crowd, sign) to simulate depth of field.  \n- **Noise**: Add a subtle noise filter to the sign (e.g., ` <feTurbulence type=\"fractalNoise\" baseFrequency=\"0.01\" result=\"noise\"/><feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\" mode=\"multiply\"/>`) to enhance the “worn” look.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key Elements for SVG**\n| Element               | Shape Type       | Fill/Filter                  | Position (Relative)       |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Man in White’s Head    | Oval             | Skin gradient                | x: 10–25%, y: 15–35%      |\n| Man in Black’s Hand    | Oval + Fingers   | Skin gradient + gold ring    | x: 10–25%, y: 25–35%      |\n| Sign Background       | Rounded Rectangle| Worn white gradient          | x: 0–100%, y: 0–15%       |\n| Sign Text             | Text             | Faded red + noise            | x: 10–90%, y: 5–10%       |\n| Background Crowd      | Ovals + Rectangles| Muted tones + blur           | x: 0–100%, y: 30–100%     |\n\nBy following these specifications, you can recreate the image’s dramatic composition, color palette, and spatial dynamics in SVG while maintaining fidelity to the original cinematic still.",
  "v1_177": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its elements, focusing on geometric precision, proportional relationships, and stylistic nuances. The image depicts a dynamic scene from **traditional Chinese opera (Beijing opera)**, centered on two primary characters with supporting figures in the background, set against an ornate red backdrop.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is dominated by **two central characters** (foreground) and **four supporting characters** (background), all framed by a decorative stage curtain. Key objects include:\n\n#### **Central Characters**\n##### **Left Character (Dan: Female Role)**\n- **Costume**: A loose-fitting, knee-length robe (\"pao\") with a **mandarin collar** and wide, flowing \"water sleeves\" (traditional for female roles). The robe features:\n  - A **bright yellow outer layer** with a **blue trim** along the collar, sleeves, and hem.\n  - Intricate **embroidery** on the chest and sleeves: Phoenixes (symbolizing femininity/nobility) in red, green, and white, surrounded by floral motifs (peonies).\n  - A **red sash** tied at the waist, with pearl tassels hanging from the front.\n- **Headdress**: A small, elevated crown (\"ji\") with:\n  - A **yellow oval ornament** at the top.\n  - **Silver tassels** (approx. 5 cm long) hanging from the front edges.\n  - Symmetrical decorations: A large **green floral ornament** (orchid/peony) on the left side, flanked by small blue and white bead clusters.\n- **Makeup**: Exaggerated \"dan\" makeup:\n  - **White base** (face powder) covering the entire face.\n  - **Pink blush** on the cheeks and forehead, blended upwards.\n  - **Black eyeliner** extended into sharp, upward points at the temples ( \"phoenix eyes\").\n  - **Red lipstick** in a small, rounded \"cherry\" shape.\n- **Gestures**: \n  - **Right hand**: Index finger extended (pointing at the right character), other fingers curled.\n  - **Left hand**: Fist curled near the chest (a traditional gesture for emphasis).\n\n##### **Right Character (Jing: Painted Face, Male Role)**\n- **Costume**: A heavy, ornate armor (\"kao\") for a military role, with:\n  - A **black base** covered in **gold filigree** (geometric and dragon motifs).\n  - **Shoulder pads**: Large, rectangular panels with circular gold patterns and a **red/gold mythical creature ornament** (qilin) on the right shoulder.\n  - **Chest plate**: A wide, curved panel with a central dragon design in gold.\n  - **Sleeves**: Tight-fitting with gold trim and circular patterns.\n- **Headdress**: A tall, symmetrical \"kui tou\" (official/military headdress) with:\n  - A **base layer** of silver pearls arranged in a circular band.\n  - **Top layer**: Three large **black pom-poms** (approx. 8 cm diameter) centered on the crown, flanked by smaller pom-poms (2 cm diameter) on either side.\n  - **Side decorations**: Silver pearl strands (approx. 10 cm long) hanging from the left/right edges, with a **white spherical ornament** (1 cm diameter) on the left side.\n- **Face Makeup**: Classic \"jing\" (painted face) for a heroic/gallant character:\n  - **White base** covering the entire face.\n  - **Black patterns**: Thick, curved lines around the eyes (extending to the temples), a vertical stripe down the center of the forehead, and angular shapes on the cheeks (resembling a \"broken face\" design).\n  - **Eyebrows**: Exaggerated, upward-curved black lines.\n- **Beard**: A long, thick \"da xu\" (big beard) in jet black, covering from the chin to the waist. The beard has a wavy texture, with strands fanning out slightly at the bottom.\n- **Gestures**: \n  - **Right hand**: Open, palm facing the left character (as if responding to her gesture).\n  - **Left hand**: Resting on the beard (partially hidden by the facial hair).\n\n#### **Supporting Characters (Chou/Extra Roles)**\nFour figures stand in a semi-circle behind the central pair, smaller in scale to indicate depth. Each wears:\n- **Costume**: Light blue (\"turquoise\") robes with **pink floral embroidery** (peonies) on the chest and sleeves. The robes have mandarin collars and loose fits.\n- **Headdress**: Small, symmetrical \"ding\" (caps) with silver pearl clusters and green floral accents.\n- **Props**: One leftmost character holds a long **spear (\"qiang\")** with a silver tip; others have hands at their sides or holding small, indistinct items.\n- **Posture**: Bodies turned slightly toward the central pair, with neutral expressions.\n\n#### **Backdrop**\nA large, red stage curtain (\"xi mu\") fills the upper two-thirds of the image, with:\n- **Gold embroidery**: A central **phoenix** (wings outstretched, feathers detailed) surrounded by **swirling cloud patterns**.\n- **Border**: A thin gold fringe along the top edge.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe color palette is bold and symbolic, with high contrast between warm/cool tones to draw attention to the central characters.\n\n| Element | Colors | Textures |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| **Left Character (Dan)** | Robe: Bright yellow (outer), blue (trim); Embroidery: Red, green, white; Headdress: Yellow, green, silver; Makeup: White (base), pink (blush), black (eyeliner), red (lipstick) | Robe: Smooth, shiny (satin/silk); Headdress: Beaded (pearls), fuzzy (floral ornament); Makeup: Flat (base), blended (blush) |\n| **Right Character (Jing)** | Armor: Black (base), gold (filigree); Headdress: Black (pom-poms), silver (pearls); Beard: Jet black; Makeup: White (base), black (patterns) | Armor: Textured (brocade), metallic (gold); Headdress: Fuzzy (pom-poms), smooth (pearls); Beard: Fluffy, wavy (simulated hair strands) |\n| **Supporting Characters** | Robes: Light blue (base), pink (embroidery); Headdresses: Silver (pearls), green (floral) | Robes: Soft, matte (cotton); Headdresses: Beaded |\n| **Backdrop** | Curtain: Deep red (crimson); Embroidery: Gold | Curtain: Woven (velvet-like), embossed (gold patterns) |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **linear perspective** and **scale** to create depth, with the central pair dominating the foreground.\n\n#### **Foreground (Central Pair)**\n- **Left Character (Dan)**: Positioned at the left third of the image, slightly turned toward the right character. Her head is level with the Jing’s shoulders (he is taller).\n- **Right Character (Jing)**: Occupies the right two-thirds of the foreground, leaning slightly toward the Dan. His head is above hers, and his beard covers most of his chest.\n- **Interaction**: The Dan’s pointing hand (right) is directed at the Jing’s chest; the Jing’s open hand (right) is near her shoulder, creating a dynamic \"conversation\" pose.\n\n#### **Background (Supporting Characters)**\n- Four figures stand in a loose semi-circle behind the central pair, spaced evenly:\n  - **Left side**: Two characters, one partially hidden by the Dan (holding a spear).\n  - **Right side**: Two characters, one partially hidden by the Jing.\n- **Scale**: Approximately 60% the height of the central pair, reinforcing their secondary role.\n- **Posture**: Bodies turned toward the center, eyes focused on the central interaction.\n\n#### **Backdrop**\n- The curtain spans the entire width of the image, with the phoenix centered horizontally. The bottom edge of the curtain aligns with the top of the central characters’ heads.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image adheres to **traditional Beijing opera aesthetics**, characterized by:\n- **Exaggeration**: Over-the-top costumes, makeup, and gestures (e.g., the Dan’s \"water sleeves,\" the Jing’s beard).\n- **Symbolism**: Colors (yellow = nobility, black = strength, red = good fortune) and motifs (phoenix = femininity, dragon = masculinity) convey character traits.\n- **Symmetry**: Both central characters have balanced headdresses and costume designs (e.g., the Jing’s pom-poms, the Dan’s floral ornaments).\n- **Theatrical Composition**: The central pair’s interaction is the focal point, with the backdrop and supporting characters framing the scene like a stage.\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**\nTo ensure accuracy in SVG (a vector format requiring precise geometric shapes), note the following:\n\n#### **Geometric Shapes**\n- **Left Character (Dan)**: \n  - Robe: Rectangular body with wide, trapezoidal sleeves; mandarin collar (triangle).\n  - Headdress: Oval (top ornament), rectangular (tassels), circular (bead clusters).\n- **Right Character (Jing)**: \n  - Armor: Rectangular (shoulder pads), curved rectangle (chest plate), circular (filigree patterns).\n  - Headdress: Circular (pearl band), spherical (pom-poms), rectangular (side decorations).\n- **Backdrop**: \n  - Phoenix: Triangular (wings), curved lines (feathers); Clouds: Swirling arcs.\n\n#### **Proportions**\n- **Central Pair**: The Jing is 1.2x taller than the Dan. His beard is 0.5x his total height (chin to waist).\n- **Supporting Characters**: 0.6x the height of the central pair.\n- **Backdrop**: 2x the height of the central pair (fills upper two-thirds of the image).\n\n#### **Symmetry**\n- **Left Character (Dan)**: Headdress decorations are mirrored on both sides (excluding the green floral ornament, which is only on the left).\n- **Right Character (Jing)**: Headdress pom-poms and pearl strands are symmetrical; armor filigree is balanced left/right.\n\n#### **Gestures**\n- **Dan’s Right Hand**: Index finger extended (15° angle from vertical); other fingers curled into a loose fist.\n- **Jing’s Right Hand**: Palm open (10 cm diameter), fingers slightly curved.\n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Robe Fabrics**: Use gradient fills (e.g., yellow to gold for the Dan’s robe) to simulate sheen.\n- **Armor**: Use pattern fills (e.g., gold filigree on black) to replicate brocade.\n- **Beard**: Use multiple curved paths with varying opacities to create a fuzzy, layered effect.\n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Artists**\nThe key to recreating this image is balancing **vector precision** (geometric shapes, proportions) with **traditional opera aesthetics** (symbolic colors, exaggerated details). Focus on the central pair’s interaction—their gestures and costume contrast (yellow/blue vs. black/gold)—as the focal point. Use layers to separate the backdrop, supporting characters, and central figures, ensuring the red curtain and gold embroidery frame the scene like a stage. Pay close attention to symmetry and symbolism, as these are core to Beijing opera’s visual language.\n\nBy following this description, an SVG artist can accurately replicate the image’s drama, color, and cultural significance.",
  "v1_178": "To accurately recreate the **Mona Lisa** as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into geometric elements, color values, spatial relationships, and stylistic traits—critical for precise vector reproduction. The analysis focuses on the **central figure**, **background landscape**, and **Renaissance artistic techniques** (e.g., *sfumato*, *chiaroscuro*).\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a vertical portrait (aspect ratio: ~1.45:1, original 77cm × 53cm) centered on a seated woman.

The shape is a truncated cone (wider at the shoulders, narrower at the waist) with soft folds.  \n  - **Collar**: A white, ruffled linen band framing the neck. It is a semicircular shape (curved top, straight bottom) that sits just above the dress.  \n  - **Pearl Earring**: A small, round pearl attached to the *right earlobe* (viewer’s left, since the subject is turned).  \n\n- **Facial Features**:  \n  - **Eyes**: Oval shapes with rounded tops and bottoms; positioned ~1/3 from the top of the head. The left eye (viewer’s left) is slightly larger due to the angle.  \n  - **Eyebrows**: Thin, arched lines starting above the inner eye corners and curving upward.  \n  - **Nose**: Straight, triangular shape with a rounded tip; casts a subtle shadow on the right side (viewer’s right).  \n  - **Lips**: A curved, slightly parted shape (upper lip thinner than lower); positioned ~1/2 from the top of the head.  \n  - **Cheeks**: Soft, rounded shapes with a pink blush.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nVermeer’s use of **chiaroscuro** (strong light/dark contrast) and **local color** (true-to-life hues with subtle tonal variations) is critical to the painting’s mood. Below are key color values (approximate hex codes) and texture notes for SVG reproduction:  \n\n| Element               | Color (Hex)               | Texture/Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Background**        | #000000 (jet black)       | Solid, matte; no texture (emphasizes the subject).                             |\n| **Skin**              | #F8D7C9 (pale peach)      | Subtle gradient: lighter on the left (highlight) → darker on the right (shadow). Add a *craquelure* pattern (fine, intersecting lines) to mimic aged paint. |\n| **Blue Headscarf Band** | #003F87 (cobalt blue)    | Gradient: light blue (#1E5799) on the left (light hit) → dark blue (#00204A) on the right (shadow). Brushstroke texture: use varying opacity paths to simulate impasto. |\n| **Yellow Scarf**      | #FFD700 (golden yellow)   | Gradient: light yellow (#FFF3CD) on the left edges → dark yellow (#B8860B) on the right. Each strip has a thin blue edge (#003F87) at the bottom. |\n| **Dress**             | #8B4513 (saddle brown)    | Gradient: light brown (#D2B48C) on the left (light hit) → dark brown (#5A3415) on the right (shadow). Texture: use diagonal brushstroke paths to mimic fabric folds. |\n| **Collar**            | #FFFFFF (pure white)      | Slight gradient: white (#FFFFFF) on the left → light gray (#E0E0E0) on the right (shadow). Ruffle detail: add 2–3 small, curved lines along the top edge. |\n| **Pearl Earring**     | #C0C0C0 (silver)          | Radial gradient: silver (#C0C0C0) at the center → white (#FFFFFF) at the upper right (highlight). The earlobe is a small, pinkish oval (#FFB6C1) beneath the pearl. |\n| **Eyes**              | Iris: #654321 (brown); Pupil: #000000 (black) | Irises are oval with a subtle radial gradient (light brown at the center → dark brown at the edges). Pupils are small circles with a white highlight (#FFFFFF) in the upper left. |\n| **Lips**              | #FF6347 (tomato red)      | Muted red with a slight gradient (darker at the edges → lighter at the center). Parted slightly (a small gap between the upper and lower lips). |\n| **Cheeks**            | #FFB6C1 (light pink)      | Soft, circular blush on the apples of the cheeks (left cheek more pronounced due to light). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centered** but with a slight leftward tilt (the subject’s face is turned ~30° toward the viewer’s left). Key spatial hierarchy (from back to front):  \n1. **Background** (darkest layer).  \n2. **Dress** (covers the lower 50% of the image; the right side is in deep shadow).  \n3. **Collar** (sits on top of the dress; frames the neck, with the left edge overlapping the dress).  \n4. **Head** (sits above the collar; the left side is lit, the right side is in shadow).  \n5. **Blue Headscarf Band** (wraps around the head; covers the forehead, temples, and nape).  \n6. **Yellow Scarf** (draped over the blue band; the strips hang down the *right side* of the back, behind the dress).  \n7. **Facial Features** (eyes, nose, lips) (foreground layer; highest contrast).  \n8. **Pearl Earring** (attached to the right earlobe; sits in front of the blue headscarf).  \n\n#### Key Proportions:\n- **Head**: Occupies 60% of the image height (from top edge to collar).  \n- **Scarf Strips**: The longest strip hangs to the bottom 1/3 of the image; the shortest is 2/3 the length of the longest.  \n- **Collar**: Width = 80% of the neck circumference; height = 10% of the head height.  \n- **Pearl Earring**: Diameter = 5% of the earlobe size; positioned 1/2 inch (digital) below the earlobe.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe painting is a quintessential example of **Baroque realism** with two defining features:  \n- **Chiaroscuro**: Strong contrast between light (left side of the subject) and dark (background, right side of the subject). The light source is *left-frontal* (viewer’s left), creating dramatic shadows on the right side of the face, scarf, and dress.  \n- **Trompe-l’œil**: Hyper-realistic details (e.g., the pearl’s高光, the scarf’s texture) that mimic three-dimensionality.  \n\n#### Brushstroke Style:\n- **Face**: Fine, smooth brushstrokes (almost invisible) to emphasize skin texture.  \n- **Scarf/Dress**: Visible, directional brushstrokes (horizontal on the blue band, vertical on the yellow strips) to convey movement and fabric texture.  \n- **Background**: Flat, uniform brushstrokes (no texture) to draw focus to the subject.  \n\n#### Composition:\n- **Rule of Thirds**: The subject’s left eye (viewer’s left) aligns with the upper-left third intersection; the pearl earring aligns with the lower-left third intersection.  \n- **Negative Space**: The dark background creates a “frame” around the subject, enhancing her prominence.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThere is no text in the painting. Key symbolic and tactile details:  \n- **Pearl Earring**: A symbol of purity and wealth in Baroque art. The高光 (white circle) is critical for realism—positioned at the *upper right* of the pearl (consistent with the light source).  \n- **Scarf Edges**: The yellow strips have subtle blue “hem” details (1–2 pixel width) at the bottom, mimicking a sewn edge.  \n- **Craquelure**: Fine, intersecting lines (1–2 pixel width) on the skin, scarf, and dress to simulate the aging of the paint. These lines are more dense on the face (due to canvas tension) and less dense on the scarf.  \n- **Eye Highlights**: Small white circles (1 pixel diameter) in the upper left of each iris, creating a “sparkle” effect.  \n- **Lip Texture**: The upper lip has a slight “cupid’s bow” shape; the lower lip is fuller with a subtle shadow at the center (from the parted gap).  \n\n\n### **SVG-Specific Notes for Reproduction**\nTo recreate the painting as an SVG, use the following vector techniques:  \n- **Gradients**: Radial (pearl) and linear (face, scarf, dress) gradients to mimic light and shadow.  \n- **Patterns**: A *craquelure pattern* (SVG `<pattern>` element) for the skin, scarf, and dress. The pattern should consist of thin, intersecting lines (1 pixel width) with 10% opacity.  \n- **Layers**: Organize elements into layers (background → dress → collar → head → scarf → facial features → earring) for easy editing.  \n- **Clipping Paths**: Use a clipping path for the head to mask the scarf and collar (ensures the scarf wraps correctly around the head).  \n- **Filters**: A subtle *Gaussian blur* (0.5 pixel) on the skin to soften the craquelure pattern; a *drop shadow* (1 pixel, black, 10% opacity) on the pearl earring to enhance depth.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical Elements for SVG**\n| Element               | SVG Technique               | Key Details                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Background            | `<rect>`                     | Solid #000000; covers 100% of the canvas.                                   |\n| Dress                 | `<path>` (truncated cone)    | Linear gradient (#8B4513 → #5A3415); diagonal brushstroke pattern.          |\n| Collar                | `<path>` (semicircle)        | Linear gradient (#FFFFFF → #E0E0E0); 2–3 curved lines for ruffles.          |\n| Head                  | `<ellipse>`                  | Linear gradient (#F8D7C9 → #D2B48C); craquelure pattern.                    |\n| Blue Headscarf Band   | `<path>` (curved rectangle)  | Linear gradient (#003F87 → #00204A); horizontal brushstroke pattern.        |\n| Yellow Scarf          | `<path>` (3–4 rectangles)    | Linear gradient (#FFD700 → #B8860B); blue edges (#003F87) at the bottom.     |\n| Pearl Earring         | `<circle>`                   | Radial gradient (#C0C0C0 → #FFFFFF); positioned on the right earlobe.       |\n| Facial Features       | `<path>` (eyes, nose, lips)  | Fine lines; high contrast (e.g., black pupils, red lips).                   |\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the composition, color, and texture of Vermeer’s masterpiece while retaining the scalability and editability of vector graphics.",

Use multiple layers with varying opacities (#9370DB, 50–70%) to simulate depth.  \n4. **Highlights**: Small `ellipse` elements (e.g., shampoo: 50px × 20px, #FFFFFF, 25% opacity) positioned at the top right of each product.  \n5. **Shadows**: `filter` elements (e.g., `drop-shadow(10px 10px 5px #6A5ACD)`) applied to each product group.  \n6. **Logo**: Use `circle` (for the border) and `path` (for the \"W\") elements. Ensure the \"W\" is centered in the circle.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s luxury, cohesion, and brand identity.",
  "v1_180": "To accurately recreate Vincent van Gogh’s *The Starry Night* as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, colors, and style—with a focus on geometric precision, spatial relationships, and textural cues necessary for digital reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe painting is divided into three primary spatial layers: **foreground** (cypress tree), **middle ground** (village and hills), and **background** (sky with stars, moon, and swirling clouds). Key elements include:\n\n#### **Sky (70% of the composition, top 2/3)**\n- **Central Spiral**: The largest and most dynamic element—an organic, clockwise spiral centered above the village steeple. It has 3–4 irregular turns, with arms that widen and narrow dynamically.  \n- **Secondary Spirals**: A smaller clockwise spiral to the right of the central one, and a looser, open spiral above the moon (top-right).  \n- **Swirling Clouds**: Horizontal, wavy strokes in the lower sky (above the hills) that merge into the larger spirals.  \n- **Stars**: 9 distinct stars (plus the moon) with concentric ring structures. The largest star is centered in the central spiral; others vary in size (10–120px diameter).  \n- **Moon**: A crescent with the open side facing right, located in the top-right quadrant.  \n\n#### **Foreground (Left 1/3)**\n- **Cypress Tree**: A tall, narrow, flame-like tree dominating the left foreground. It has a wide base (200px at the bottom) tapering to a pointed top (50px at the top), with 5–6 sharp, upward-protruding “branches” (flame-like peaks) along its left and right edges.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground (Bottom 1/3)**\n- **Village**: A clustered settlement at the center-bottom, featuring:  \n  - A **church** with a tall, pointed steeple (the tallest structure in the village) and a rectangular nave with a gabled roof.  \n  - Small houses with varying roof shapes (gabled, hipped) and tiny windows.  \n- **Hills**: Undulating, low-lying hills behind the village, with wavy contours.  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Mountains**: Dark, solid mountain ranges behind the hills, with irregular, jagged edges.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nVan Gogh’s signature **thick impasto brushstrokes** and high-contrast color palette are critical to the painting’s mood. For SVG, texture will be simulated using layered paths, gradients, and partial transparency.\n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Base Colors**: Dominated by **cobalt blue** (#0B3D91), **cerulean blue** (#2A52BE), and **navy blue** (#001F3F). Lighter blues (#6495ED) and whites (#F0F8FF) are used for spiral highlights.  \n- **Swirls**: Dynamic, organic spirals with **directional brushstrokes** (following the spiral’s curve). Strokes vary in width (1–5px) and color (dark to light blue, with white accents) to mimic impasto.  \n- **Stars**: 9 stars with **3–4 concentric rings** (irregular, not perfectly circular). Core: bright yellow (#FFD700); middle: light yellow (#FFFFE0); outer: white (#FFFFFF) and pale blue (#B0E0E6).  \n- **Moon**: A crescent (open side to the right) with **4 concentric rings**. Core: yellow (#FFD700); middle: light yellow (#FFFFE0); outer: greenish-white (#E6F9F0) and pale blue (#B0E0E6). The left side of the crescent has wider outer rings.  \n\n#### **Foreground: Cypress Tree**\n- **Shape**: Tall (full height of the canvas), narrow (200px wide at the base, tapering to 50px at the top), with 5–6 sharp, upward-pointing protrusions (like flames) along its edges.  \n- **Texture**: Rough, textured surface with **diagonal brushstrokes** (45°) in dark green (#006400) and black (#000000). The base is wider and more bulbous, with branches fanning out slightly.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground: Village & Hills**\n- **Village**: Clustered at the bottom center, with:  \n  - **Church**: A tall, white steeple (150px tall, 20px wide) with a pointed top, centered above a rectangular nave (gray, #808080) with a red gabled roof (#8B0000).  \n  - **Houses**: Small, irregularly shaped structures (gray, #A9A9A9; brown, #8B4513) with varying roof types (gabled, hipped). Roofs have horizontal brushstrokes in darker shades.  \n  - **Windows**: Tiny yellow (#FFFF00) squares/circles (10–15px) with 50% transparency, scattered across houses.  \n- **Hills**: Undulating, wavy contours behind the village, with **horizontal brushstrokes** (parallel to the horizon). Colors: light blue (#6495ED), medium blue (#4682B4), and green (#2E8B57).  \n\n#### **Background: Mountains**\n- **Shape**: Dark, solid ranges behind the hills, with irregular, jagged edges.  \n- **Color**: Navy blue (#001F3F) with subtle lighter blue (#4682B4) highlights. Few brushstrokes (to create depth).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nVan Gogh’s post-Impressionist style relies on **thick impasto** (simulated in SVG with layered paths) and **dynamic color contrast**. Key textural and color details:\n\n| Element               | Primary Colors                          | Texture Cues (SVG Simulation)                |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Sky Spirals**       | #0B3D91, #2A52BE, #F0F8FF               | Layered curved paths (1–3px stroke) with 30–50% transparency. |\n| **Stars/Moon**        | #FFD700 (core), #FFFFFF (outer rings)    | Radial gradients (center to edge) with 50–70% transparency on outer rings. |\n| **Cypress Tree**      | #006400 (base), #000000 (strokes)       | Layered diagonal paths (2–4px stroke) covering the tree shape. |\n| **Village Houses**    | #808080 (walls), #8B0000 (roofs)        | Solid fills with horizontal stroke accents (1–2px) for roofs. |\n| **Hills**             | #6495ED, #2E8B57                        | Horizontal paths (1–2px stroke) spaced 5–10px apart. |\n| **Mountains**         | #001F3F                                 | Solid fills with subtle linear gradients (top: lighter blue, bottom: darker blue). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **triangular focal points** (central spiral, cypress, church steeple) to guide the eye. Here’s the layout in a 1200px × 900px canvas (typical ratio):\n\n| Element               | Position (X, Y)                          | Size/Proportions                              |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **Central Spiral**    | Centered at (600, 300)                   | 400px wide × 300px tall (3–4 clockwise turns). |\n| **Largest Star**      | (600, 300)                               | 120px diameter (4 concentric rings).          |\n| **Moon**              | (1000, 150)                              | 180px diameter (crescent shape).              |\n| **Cypress Tree**      | Left third (100–300px X)                 | 900px tall (full canvas height), 200px wide at base. |\n| **Church Steeple**    | (600, 500)                               | 150px tall (from y=500 to y=700), 20px wide.  |\n| **Village**           | Bottom center (400–800px X)             | 300px tall (y=600–900), clustered houses.     |\n| **Hills**             | (0–1200px X)                             | 200px tall (y=500–700), wavy top edge.        |\n| **Mountains**         | (0–1200px X)                             | 300px tall (y=300–600), dark blue.            |\n\n#### **Layering (Bottom to Top)**\n1. **Sky** (base layer: solid blue with spiral paths).  \n2. **Mountains** (over sky).  \n3. **Hills** (over mountains).  \n4. **Village** (over hills).  \n5. **Cypress Tree** (over village and hills—foreground).  \n6. **Stars/Moon** (top layer: over sky and cypress).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nVan Gogh’s post-Impressionist style is defined by:  \n- **Dynamic Movement**: Spirals and brushstrokes create a sense of swirling motion (simulated in SVG with curved paths following the spiral’s direction).  \n- **Impasto**: Thick, textured brushstrokes (simulated with layered paths, varying stroke widths, and partial transparency).  \n- **High Contrast**: Dark cypress tree (#006400) vs. bright sky (#F0F8FF); warm stars/moon (#FFD700) vs. cool blues (#0B3D91).  \n- **Organic Shapes**: Spirals, stars, and the cypress are not geometrically perfect—they have irregular edges and uneven brushstrokes (e.g., stars have “rough” outer rings; the moon’s crescent is slightly lopsided).  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**\nTo capture van Gogh’s texture and mood, include these critical nuances:  \n\n#### **Sky Spirals**\n- **Irregular Edges**: The central spiral has a “loose” shape with arms that widen/narrow dynamically (avoid perfect Archimedean spirals).  \n- **Stroke Direction**: All spiral paths follow the **clockwise rotation** of the central spiral. Secondary spirals (right of center) are smaller and tighter.  \n- **Transparency**: Spiral paths have 30–50% transparency to blend with the sky and create depth.  \n\n#### **Stars**\n- **Irregular Rings**: Outer rings of stars are not perfectly circular—add 1–2px “jagged” paths (simulating brushstrokes) to the edges.  \n- **Gradient Fades**: Radial gradients for stars/moon should fade from solid (core) to transparent (outer rings) to blend with the sky.  \n\n#### **Cypress Tree**\n- **Protrusions**: Add 5–6 sharp, upward-pointing paths (10–20px tall) along the left/right edges of the tree (like flames).  \n- **Texture**: Cover the entire tree shape with diagonal paths (45°) in dark green (#006400) and black (#000000)—stroke widths 2–4px, spaced 5–10px apart.  \n\n#### **Village**\n- **Roof Shapes**: The church has a **gabled roof** (triangle), while surrounding houses have **hipped roofs** (sloped on all sides) or flat roofs.  \n- **Window Placement**: Windows are small (10–15px) and scattered—avoid uniform spacing (e.g., 2 windows on the church, 1 on a nearby house).  \n\n#### **Moon**\n- **Crescent Shape**: The open side faces right—use a **boolean subtraction** (large circle minus smaller circle) to create the crescent, then add outer rings (wider on the left side).  \n- **Gradient Direction**: The moon’s radial gradient is centered on the crescent’s “core” (not the canvas center) to maintain perspective.  \n\n\n### **6. SVG Technical Notes**\n- **Paths**: Use `<path>` elements for spirals, the cypress tree, and the moon’s crescent. For spirals, use `d` attributes with curved commands (C, Q) to follow the organic shape.  \n- **Gradients**: Use `<radialGradient>` for stars/moon (center to edge) and `<linearGradient>` for mountains (top to bottom).  \n- **Transparency**: Set `opacity=\"0.5\"` on outer star/moon rings and spiral paths to mimic blending.  \n- **Stroke Widths**: Vary `stroke-width` (1–5px) for spirals and cypress texture—thicker strokes in the center of spirals, thinner on the edges.  \n- **Grouping**: Group elements by layer (e.g., `<g id=\"sky\">` for spiral paths, `<g id=\"cypress\">` for tree texture) to simplify editing.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Artists**\nTo recreate *The Starry Night* accurately:  \n- Prioritize **organic shapes** (not geometric perfection) for spirals, stars, and the cypress.  \n- Use **layered paths** with varying stroke widths/colors to simulate impasto.  \n- Follow the **spatial layering** (sky → mountains → hills → village → cypress → stars/moon) to maintain depth.  \n- Emphasize **color contrast** (dark cypress vs. bright sky, warm vs. cool tones) to capture van Gogh’s mood.  \n\nWith these details, the SVG will not only replicate the composition but also the emotional energy and textural richness of the original painting.",
  "v1_181": "To accurately recreate Gustav Klimt’s *The Kiss* (1907–1908) as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and stylistic choices with geometric precision, color values, and spatial relationships. The analysis prioritizes reproducible details (e.g., pattern placement, proportions, and texture) while honoring Klimt’s Art Nouveau aesthetic and use of gold leaf.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is a **tall vertical rectangle** (approx. 3:4 aspect ratio) centered on an embracing couple. Key elements include:  \n- **The Couple**: The focal point, occupying 85% of the vertical space. The man (left) and woman (right) are intertwined, with their heads tilted toward a kiss.  \n  - **Man**: Dark-haired (oval shape), wearing a geometric-patterned tunic. His hands cup the woman’s face/head.  \n  - **Woman**: Light-haired (oval shape), wearing an organic-patterned dress. Her hands rest on the man’s arms/shoulders.  \n- **Grass Foreground**: A horizontal band at the bottom (15% of the height) with dense, small flowers.  \n- **Golden Background**: A textured field extending from the top to the grass, with scattered specks (resembling stardust or gold leaf fragments).  \n\n\n#### **Key Shapes**\n- **Heads**:  \n  - Man: Dark oval (x: 38%, y: 4%, width: 28%, height: 16%) with a green wreath (x: 42%, y: 7%, width: 18%, height: 12%) of 5–7 leaves/flowers.  \n  - Woman: Pale oval (x: 52%, y: 10%, width: 22%, height: 14%) with a flower wreath (x: 55%, y: 12%, width: 14%, height: 10%) of blue/purple petals.  \n- **Faces**: Overlapping slightly (man’s face above woman’s). Closed eyes (thin black lines), subtle noses (curved lines), and a merged “kissing” mouth (thin red curves).  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - Man (left): Grid of vertical/horizontal rectangles (1–5% width/height) in black, white, and gray. Rectangles are irregularly spaced but follow a loose vertical alignment.  \n  - Woman (right): Organic pattern of circles (1–6% diameter) and flowers (4–6 petals). Circles include concentric rings (e.g., red center → white ring → yellow outer) and solid colors.  \n- **Tassels**: 6–8 long, thin lines (x: 65–75%, y: 70%, width: 0.3%, height: 25%) on the woman’s dress, with small gold triangles (0.2% width × 0.3% height) attached at 5% intervals.  \n- **Grass**: Horizontal band (y: 85–100%) with a green base and 1,000+ small flowers (0.5% diameter centers with 4–6 petal triangles).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nKlimt’s use of **gold leaf** dominates, with contrasting patterns and a vibrant foreground. Below are hex codes and texture notes for SVG reproduction:  \n\n| Element               | Color(s)                                  | Texture/Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Background**        | Gradient: #D4AF37 (pale gold) → #8B4513 (dark gold) | Granular texture (use SVG noise filter: `feTurbulence` with baseFrequency 0.05). |\n| **Man’s Clothing**    | Black (#000000), white (#FFFFFF), gray (#808080) | Flat colors; rectangles have sharp edges.                                      |\n| **Woman’s Dress**     | Yellow (#FFD700), red (#FF0000), blue (#0000FF), purple (#800080), white (#FFFFFF) | Flat colors; circles/flowers have soft edges (1px blur).                       |\n| **Skin Tones**        | Man: #D2B48C (light tan); Woman: #F0E68C (pale tan) | Subtle pink (#FFB6C1) blushing on cheeks.                                     |\n| **Grass**             | Gradient: #008000 (dark green) → #228B22 (light green) | Dense, overlapping flowers (no blur).                                         |\n| **Flowers (Grass)**   | Purple (#9370DB), pink (#FFC0CB), blue (#4169E1), white (#FFFFFF) | Centers: 0.2% diameter white/yellow; petals: triangular shapes.                |\n| **Specks (Background)** | White (#FFFFFF) or yellow (#FFFF00)       | 0.1% diameter circles; scattered randomly (higher density in center).         |\n| **Signature**         | Gold (#FFD700) or dark brown (#8B4513)    | Cursive font (e.g., \"Gustav Klimt\"); slightly tilted (10° right).             |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centered vertically and horizontally** with a strong vertical emphasis. Key layers (from foreground to background):  \n1. **Grass/Flowers**: Bottom 15% (closest to viewer).  \n2. **Couple**: Middle 80% (focal point). Man’s geometric patterns (left) balance woman’s organic patterns (right).  \n3. **Background**: Top 5% to grass edge (receding space). Specks decrease in size/density toward the edges to create depth.  \n\n#### **Relative Sizing**\n- **Heads**: 15–20% of the total height.  \n- **Clothing**: Man’s tunic extends from head to waist (50% height); woman’s dress extends from head to grass (85% height).  \n- **Tassels**: 25% of the total height (hang from woman’s dress to grass).  \n- **Flowers (Grass)**: 0.5–1% of the grass band height (dense, but not overlapping excessively).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n*The Kiss* exemplifies Klimt’s **Golden Phase** (1903–1909) and **Art Nouveau** principles:  \n- **Flat Decorative Patterns**: Geometric (man) vs. organic (woman) patterns create visual tension.  \n- **Gold Leaf Effect**: The background and clothing use gradients and texture to mimic metallic sheen.  \n- **Asymmetrical Balance**: Man’s structured left side balances woman’s flowing right side.  \n- **Symbolism**: Circles (eternity), flowers (love/nature), and gold (divinity/wealth) are recurring motifs.  \n\nFor SVG, prioritize **flat colors** (avoid shading) but use **gradients** for gold areas to add depth. The noise filter on the background is critical to replicate the granular gold leaf texture.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Signature**: \"Gustav Klimt\" in the **bottom right corner** (x: 82%, y: 92%). Use a cursive font (e.g., \"Edwardian Script ITC\") with a 2% font size. Color: #8B4513 (dark brown) to contrast with the golden background.  \n- **Specks**: 500–1,000 small circles (0.1% diameter) in white/yellow, scattered randomly. Use a `random()` function in SVG to avoid repetition.  \n- **Flower Details**: Each grass flower has a central circle (0.2% diameter) with 4–6 petal triangles. For example:  \n  - Purple flower: Center #FFFFFF (white), petals #9370DB (lavender).  \n  - Pink flower: Center #FFFF00 (yellow), petals #FFC0CB (pink).  \n- **Eye/Eyebrow Lines**: Thin black lines (0.1% width) for closed eyes; eyebrows are slightly arched (10° angle).  \n- **Mouth**: Merged red curves (x: 47–57%, y: 20–24%) to represent a kiss. Use #FF69B4 (hot pink) for subtle blushing.  \n\n\n### **SVG Technical Notes**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these guidelines:  \n- **Layers**: Organize elements into groups (e.g., `#background`, `#couple`, `#grass`, `#signature`).  \n- **Clipping Paths**: Use a clipping path for the couple’s oval top shape (x: 35%, y: 2%, width: 30%, height: 20%) to soften the head/shoulder transition.  \n- **Filters**: Apply a `feGaussianBlur` (stdDeviation 1) to the woman’s dress circles for a subtle glow. Use `feTurbulence` (baseFrequency 0.05) on the background for texture.  \n- **Responsiveness**: Use **relative units** (percentages) for all positions/sizes to ensure the SVG scales correctly.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical SVG Elements**\n| Element               | Key SVG Properties                                  |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Background**        | Gradient + noise filter; specks (random circles).  |\n| **Couple**            | Clipping path for oval top; geometric/organic patterns. |\n| **Grass**             | Dense flowers (use a loop for repetition).         |\n| **Signature**         | Cursive font; bottom right; dark brown color.      |\n| **Gold Leaf**         | Gradients (pale → dark gold); flat colors for patterns. |\n\nBy adhering to this description, an SVG artist can recreate *The Kiss* with fidelity to Klimt’s original while leveraging SVG’s capabilities for scalable, detailed reproduction.",
  "v1_182": "To accurately recreate Sandro Botticelli’s *The Birth of Venus* (c. 1485) as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition by **main elements**, **colors/textures**, **spatial relationships**, **style**, and **specific details**. The focus is on geometric precision, proportionality, and visual cues necessary for a faithful vector reproduction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is a balanced, symbolic narrative centered on the birth of Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Key elements include:  \n- **Central Figure (Venus)**: A nude, idealized woman standing on a large scallop shell. She has long, wavy golden hair, one hand covering her breast (right) and the other holding a lock of hair (left). Her pose is slightly twisted, with one foot forward.  \n- **Left Group (Zephyr and Chloris)**: Two intertwined figures flying from the left. The male (Zephyr, god of the west wind) has dark hair and muscular limbs; the female (Chloris, a nymph) has lighter hair and is held in his arms. Both wear flowing robes.  \n- **Right Figure (Horae/Nymph)**: A standing woman offering a large cloak to Venus. She has long red hair, a white floral dress, and a red cloak with black patterns. She leans slightly forward, holding the cloak with both hands.  \n- **Scallop Shell**: A massive, ridged shell beneath Venus, with a pinkish-orange center and cream-colored ridges. It floats in the sea, partially submerged.  \n- **Background**: A teal sea with subtle ripples, a horizon line separating the sea from a gradient blue sky, and distant landmasses (three tiers) on the right. Dense dark green trees frame the right edge.  \n- **Falling Elements**: Pink roses (5 petals each), green leaves, and small butterflies/moths scattered across the left and center.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nBotticelli’s palette is soft and harmonious, with flat color planes and subtle shading. Textures emphasize flow (drapery), smoothness (skin), and structure (shell/trees).  \n\n| Element | Color | Texture/Details |\n|---------|-------|-----------------|\n| **Venus** | Skin: Pale peach with subtle pink shading (cheeks, collarbone, hips). Hair: Golden blonde with honey highlights. | Smooth skin; hair rendered with wavy, layered lines. |\n| **Scallop Shell** | Ridges: Creamy white. Center: Salmon-pink with radial shading. | Ridges are 14–16 distinct, curved lines; center has a matte, slightly textured finish. |\n| **Left Group (Zephyr/Chloris)** | Robes: Light sky blue. Skin: Zephyr (tan), Chloris (pale). Flowers on robes: Pink. | Robes have dynamic, billowing folds (indicated by dark blue lines); flowers are small, 5-petaled shapes. |\n| **Right Figure** | Cloak: Crimson red with black floral/leaf patterns. Dress: White with tiny blue/green floral motifs. Hair: Auburn with copper highlights. | Cloak has heavy, voluminous folds; dress fabric is matte with repeated, delicate patterns. |\n| **Sea** | Teal (light cyan at horizon, darker teal in foreground). | Subtle horizontal ripples (fine, parallel lines) indicating movement. |\n| **Sky** | Gradient: Light azure (horizon) to deep cobalt (top). | Smooth, no clouds; gradient transitions evenly. |\n| **Landmasses (Right)** | Foreground: Dark green-brown. Middle: Olive green. Background: Pale green. | Triangular shapes with subtle shading to suggest depth. |\n| **Trees (Right)** | Trunks: Dark brown. Leaves: Forest green. | Trunks are straight, textured with vertical lines; leaves are dense, pointed, and clustered. |\n| **Falling Flowers/Butterflies** | Flowers: Pink petals, green stems. Butterflies: Tan wings with black veins. | Flowers have 5 petals; butterflies are small, symmetrical shapes. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **symmetrically balanced** around Venus, with movement directed toward her from the left (wind gods) and right (nymph). Key positional cues:  \n\n- **Venus**: Centered vertically and horizontally. She stands on the scallop shell, which rests in the lower third of the image (shell’s base touches the sea). Her head aligns with the horizon line (midpoint of the image).  \n- **Left Group (Zephyr/Chloris)**: Located in the **upper left quadrant**, flying toward Venus. Zephyr (male) is behind Chloris (female), their bodies overlapping. Their feet are angled downward, suggesting forward motion.  \n- **Right Figure**: Standing on the **upper right shoreline**, leaning slightly toward Venus. Her feet are planted on a dark, rocky foreground; her cloak extends diagonally across the right third of the image.  \n- **Background**:  \n  - **Sea**: Occupies the lower half, with ripples extending from the shell.  \n  - **Sky**: Occupies the upper half, with a gradient that lightens toward the horizon.  \n  - **Landmasses**: Three tiered, triangular shapes on the right, receding into the distance (foreground = dark, background = light).  \n  - **Trees**: Frame the right edge, with trunks rising from the shoreline to the top of the image.  \n\n#### **Proportions**  \n- Venus’s height: ~1.5x the shell’s height (shell is wider than she is, with ridges extending beyond her shoulders).  \n- Left group: Slightly smaller than Venus (due to “distance” in the flat perspective).  \n- Right figure: Same height as Venus, but positioned farther back (indicated by the shoreline).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nBotticelli’s Renaissance style is defined by **linear precision**, **idealized forms**, and **symbolic narrative**. Key traits for SVG reproduction:  \n\n- **Linearity**: Strong, clean outlines define figures, drapery, and objects (e.g., shell ridges, hair strands).  \n- **Flat Color Planes**: Minimal chiaroscuro (shading); color is applied in solid blocks with subtle gradients (e.g., sky, sea).  \n- **Flowing Drapery**: Robes and cloaks have dynamic, rhythmic folds (rendered with parallel lines) to suggest movement.  \n- **Idealized Anatomy**: Venus’s body is elongated and symmetrical, with a small waist and rounded hips (classic Renaissance “ideal”).  \n- **Symbolism**:  \n  - **Scallop Shell**: Birth (Venus emerged from sea foam).  \n  - **Falling Flowers**: Beauty and fertility (roses = love, myrtles = chastity).  \n  - **Wind Gods (Left)**: Zephyr (west wind) and Chloris (nymph) blowing Venus to shore.  \n  - **Right Figure**: Possibly a Horae (seasonal nymph) offering a cloak, symbolizing Venus’s transition to land.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Critical for SVG Accuracy)**\nThese nuances distinguish Botticelli’s work and must be replicated precisely:  \n\n#### **Venus**  \n- **Pose**: Standing with weight on her right foot (toes pointing down), left foot slightly forward. Arms are raised: right hand covers her left breast, left hand holds a loose lock of hair (hair falls past her knees).  \n- **Hair**: 6–8 large, wavy sections; strands are defined with fine lines. A small braid or twist is visible at the nape of her neck.  \n- **Skin Shading**: Subtle pink blush on cheeks, bridge of nose, and elbows. Darker lines define collarbone, ribcage, and hip bones.  \n\n#### **Scallop Shell**  \n- **Ridges**: 14–16 evenly spaced, curved lines radiating from the center. Each ridge has a light highlight on the top edge (to suggest volume).  \n- **Center**: Salmon-pink with radial shading (darker at the base, lighter toward the edges). The shell’s base is submerged in the sea, with small ripples extending outward.  \n\n#### **Left Group (Zephyr/Chloris)**  \n- **Embrace**: Zephyr’s arms wrap around Chloris’s waist; her arms loop around his neck. Their legs are bent (knees raised), with feet pointing downward.  \n- **Robes**: Zephyr’s robe (light blue) billows behind him, with 5–6 large folds. Chloris’s robe (same blue) is draped over her shoulders, with flowers stuck to the fabric (3–4 pink roses).  \n- **Movement**: Flowers and leaves fall from their robes, with trajectories angled toward Venus (suggesting wind direction).  \n\n#### **Right Figure**  \n- **Cloak**: Crimson red with black floral patterns (roses and leaves). The cloak is held open by both hands, with folds cascading down her back.  \n- **Dress**: White with tiny, repeated floral motifs (vines and daisies). The bodice is tight-fitting, with a ruffled neckline; the skirt is full, with 4–5 layers of folds.  \n- **Hair**: Auburn, with 3–4 long, wavy sections flowing to her waist. A garland of flowers (roses) adorns her head.  \n- **Feet**: Bare, with toes pointing forward (planted on the shoreline).  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Sea**: Subtle horizontal ripples (1–2 pixels thick) extending from the shell. The water lightens toward the horizon (teal → cyan).  \n- **Landmasses**: Three triangular shapes on the right, with the closest being dark green-brown and the farthest pale green (atmospheric perspective).  \n- **Trees**: 6–8 tall, straight trunks (dark brown) with dense, pointed leaves (forest green). Leaves are clustered in groups of 5–7, with veins defined by fine lines.  \n- **Butterflies**: 2–3 small, tan shapes with black veins, flying among the flowers (located in the center-left, near the sea).  \n\n#### **Light and Shadow**  \n- **Direction**: Light comes from the left (Venus’s left shoulder is highlighted, right side is slightly darker).  \n- **Shading**: Shell ridges have light highlights on the left edge; drapery folds have dark lines on the “inner” side (e.g., Zephyr’s robe).  \n\n\n### **SVG Technical Notes**\nFor accurate reproduction, use:  \n- **Layers**: Separate layers for figures, shell, sea, sky, trees, and flowers (to adjust visibility/positioning).  \n- **Paths**: Use Bézier curves for drapery folds, hair, and shell ridges (Botticelli’s lines are smooth and rhythmic).  \n- **Gradients**: Linear gradients for the sky (cobalt → azure) and sea (teal → cyan). Radial gradient for the shell’s center (salmon → cream).  \n- **Patterns**: Repeating floral motifs for the right figure’s dress (use a symbol for consistency) and red cloak (black flowers/leaves).  \n- **Opacity**: Subtle opacity (80–90%) for the sea ripples to suggest translucency.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will capture Botticelli’s iconic composition—its beauty, symbolism, and Renaissance harmony—with the precision required for a faithful reproduction.",
  "v1_183": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image (a detailed analysis of James Abbott McNeill Whistler’s *Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1*, commonly known as *Whistler’s Mother*), the following breakdown of **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and precise details** is critical. The description prioritizes geometric clarity, proportionality, and texture to guide vector reconstruction.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is a **portrait of a seated woman** in a sparse, tonal interior. Key objects include:  \n- **The Woman**: Central subject, seated in profile facing left. Her form is defined by:  \n  - A long, flowing **black dress** (dominant shape: a large, curved rectangle from shoulders to floor, tapering slightly at the wrists and expanding at the hem).  \n  - **White lace accents**: Cuffs (ruffled, semicircular edges), collar (high-neck ruffle), and a **bonnet** (semicircular top with a rectangular back panel tied under the chin).  \n  - **Clasped hands**: Small, oval shapes with lace cuffs overlapping.  \n- **Chair**: A high-backed wooden chair behind her, partially obscured by the dress. Visible elements:  \n  - A tall, narrow **backrest** (vertical rectangle, ~1/3 the width of the woman’s shoulders).  \n  - A **seat** (shallow rectangle) supporting her thighs.  \n- **Wall**: Flat, rectangular background occupying 75% of the image width (right of the curtain).  \n- **Curtain**: Leftmost element, a tall, narrow rectangle (25% of image width) with a floral pattern.  \n- **Floor**: Wooden planks (diagonal rectangles) extending from the bottom left to top right.  \n- **Stool**: Small, rectangular block under the woman’s feet (supports her heels).  \n- **Paintings**: Two framed artworks on the wall:  \n  - **Main Painting**: Centered above the woman, a rectangular frame with a landscape (building, water, bridge).  \n  - **Partial Painting**: Right edge of the image, a cropped rectangular frame (matches the main painting’s style).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **tonal and monochromatic**, dominated by grays, blacks, and whites, with subtle accents. Textures are flat but imply materiality via brushstroke模拟 (simulated in SVG via gradients or pattern fills).  \n\n| Object               | Color Palette                          | Texture/Visual Properties                                                                 |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Woman’s Dress**    | Deep black (#000000) with dark gray (#222222) gradients. | Smooth, satin-like finish—use **radial gradients** (darker at edges, lighter at center) to create volume. |\n| **Lace (Cuffs, Collar, Bonnet)** | Bright white (#FFFFFF) with faint gray (#E0E0E0) shadows. | Ruffled, textured edges—use **dashed lines** or **small semicircles** to mimic lace’s porous, frilly quality. |\n| **Bonnet**           | White (#FFFFFF) with a gray (#D3D3D3) inner lining. | Soft, folded fabric—add subtle **diagonal gradients** to suggest depth. |\n| **Wall**             | Light gray (#D0D0D0) fading to dark gray (#808080) at edges. | Matte, brushed texture—use **horizontal linear gradients** to replicate Whistler’s tonal “arrangement” (focus on the woman). |\n| **Curtain**          | Dark blue-black (#1A1A2E) with white (#FFFFFF) and silver (#C0C0C0) floral patterns. | Woven, textured surface—use **repeatable vector patterns** (small flowers + vines) to mimic embroidery. |\n| **Floor**            | Light brown (#B0A080) with dark brown (#806040) plank lines. | Weathered wood—use **diagonal linear gradients** (lighter in center, darker at edges) and **thin, parallel lines** to define planks. |\n| **Stool**            | Tan (#D4AF37) with dark brown (#8B4513) edges. | Solid, wooden block—flat fill with a **small gradient** (darker at the base) for weight. |\n| **Painting Frames**  | Black (#000000) with a thin white (#FFFFFF) mat. | Glossy, rectangular frames—use **stroke outlines** (10px width) with a **slight inner shadow** to simulate depth. |\n| **Main Painting Artwork** | Neutral grays (#A0A0A0 to #404040). | Blurred landscape—use **soft gradients** and **low-opacity shapes** to mimic distant buildings/water. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **symmetrical and centered** on the woman, with strict proportionality to guide focus. Use a **1:1.2 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1000px width × 1200px height) for the overall canvas.  \n\n| Object               | Position (Relative to Canvas)          | Proportions                                                                 |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Curtain**          | Left 25% of the canvas (0–250px wide).  | Height: Full canvas (0–1200px). Width: 25% of total (250px for 1000px canvas). |\n| **Wall**             | Right 75% of the canvas (250–1000px).   | Height: Full canvas. Horizontal center: Aligned with the woman’s torso.      |\n| **Main Painting**    | Centered horizontally (500px), top 5% (50px from top). | Size: 300px wide × 200px tall (1/3 canvas width, 1/6 canvas height).        |\n| **Woman**            | Vertically centered (600px from top).   | Width: 40% of canvas (400px). Height: 80% of canvas (960px)—from head (150px) to hem (1110px). |\n| **Chair**            | Behind the woman, 300–700px wide.       | Backrest: 100px wide × 400px tall (aligns with the top of her head to mid-back). |\n| **Stool**            | Under her feet (1000px from top).       | Size: 150px wide × 50px tall (supports heels, not toes).                    |\n| **Partial Painting** | Right edge (950–1000px), top 5% (50px). | Visible width: 50px (matches main frame’s 10px border).                     |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nWhistler’s style is **tonal realism** with a focus on **composition as “arrangement”** (balance of shapes and grays). Key stylistic elements to replicate:  \n- **Flatness with Depth**: Use **subtle gradients** (not heavy shading) to define form (e.g., the dress fades from black to dark gray at the center to suggest volume).  \n- **Brushstroke Texture**: Simulate the canvas’s brushed surface via:  \n  - **Horizontal linear gradients** on the wall (light gray center, dark gray edges).  \n  - **Diagonal “plank” lines** on the floor (thin, parallel strokes in dark brown).  \n- **Negative Space**: The sparse interior (empty walls, minimal furniture) draws focus to the woman. Use **white space** (e.g., the wall’s blankness) to emphasize her silhouette.  \n- **Symmetry**: The main painting is centered above the woman, and the curtain balances the right-hand wall. Align elements to a **vertical grid** (e.g., the woman’s spine, the painting’s left edge).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nPrecise, small-scale details are critical for accuracy. These include:  \n- **Lace Patterns**:  \n  - **Cuffs**: Each wrist has a **3-layer ruffle** (small semicircles, 5px radius) in white. The cuffs overlap at the hands (clasped, with the right hand on top).  \n  - **Collar**: A high-neck ruffle (10px tall) extending 20px down the front of the dress.  \n  - **Bonnet**: A 50px-wide lace edge along the front (semicircular, 150px diameter) and a 20px-wide ribbon tied under the chin (white, 5px thick).  \n- **Curtain Pattern**:  \n  - Repeatable **floral motif**: Small flowers (5px diameter, white) with 2px stems (silver) and 1px leaves (gray). Spacing: 20px vertical × 15px horizontal.  \n  - **Vertical “ribbon” lines**: 1px-wide silver strokes running the length of the curtain (every 20px), intersecting the floral pattern.  \n- **Floor Planks**:  \n  - 10 planks total, each 100px wide (for 1000px canvas). Use **diagonal lines** (45° from bottom left to top right) in dark brown to define edges.  \n  - **Wear Texture**: Add 1px-wide light brown “scratches” (random, short strokes) to the planks.  \n- **Shadows**:  \n  - **Wall Shadow**: Behind the woman, a dark gray (#444444) silhouette 10px larger than her profile (soft edges, 50% opacity).  \n  - **Floor Shadow**: Under the chair, a 200px-wide × 50px-tall dark gray shape (aligns with the seat).  \n- **Painting Artwork**:  \n  - **Main Frame**: 10px-wide black border with a 20px white mat.  \n  - **Landscape Inside**: A 260px × 160px rectangle with:  \n    - Left: A 50px-tall “building” (gray, rectangular).  \n    - Center: A 100px-wide “water” (light gray, horizontal gradient).  \n    - Right: A 30px-wide “bridge” (dark gray, diagonal line).  \n- **Signature**: A faint, circular mark (5px diameter) on the curtain’s top-left corner (20px from top, 20px from left)—simulate with a 1px gray stroke.  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric and Proportional Guidelines for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, use a **1000px × 1200px canvas** (standard for digital reproduction) and align elements to the following grid:  \n\n| Element              | X Position (px) | Y Position (px) | Width (px) | Height (px) |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|\n| **Curtain**          | 0               | 0               | 250        | 1200        |\n| **Wall**             | 250             | 0               | 750        | 1200        |\n| **Main Painting**    | 350             | 50              | 300        | 200         |\n| **Woman’s Head**     | 650             | 150             | 100        | 100         |\n| **Woman’s Torso**    | 500             | 250             | 300        | 300         |\n| **Woman’s Dress Hem**| 400             | 1110            | 600        | 90          |\n| **Chair Backrest**   | 600             | 150             | 100        | 400         |\n| **Stool**            | 300             | 1000            | 150        | 50          |\n| **Partial Painting** | 950             | 50              | 50         | 200         |\n\n\n### **7. Texture and Gradient Specifications**\n- **Dress**: Radial gradient from #000000 (edges) to #222222 (center) (50% opacity at the center).  \n- **Wall**: Horizontal linear gradient from #D0D0D0 (center) to #808080 (left/right edges) (70% opacity at edges).  \n- **Floor**: Diagonal linear gradient from #B0A080 (center) to #806040 (edges) (80% opacity at edges).  \n- **Curtain**: Pattern fill (floral + ribbon) on a #1A1A2E base, with a 10% white overlay (simulates light catching the fabric).  \n\n\n### **Final Notes for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into groups (e.g., *Woman*, *Wall*, *Curtain*) for easy editing.  \n- **Edges**: Use **soft masks** (5px blur) for shadows and the curtain’s floral pattern to mimic paint’s diffusion.  \n- **Scalability**: Ensure all shapes are **vector-based** (no raster images) to maintain clarity at any size.  \n- **Color Accuracy**: Match the tonal scale (grays, blacks, whites) closely—Whistler’s “arrangement” depends on subtle contrast, not bold color.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will replicate the painting’s mood, composition, and detail while retaining the precision required for digital use.",
  "v1_184": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description covers **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details**—with a focus on geometric precision, texture, and period-accurate elements (consistent with Northern Renaissance portraiture, e.g., Jan van Eyck’s 1434 *Arnolfini Portrait*, though adapted for this specific composition).\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image depicts a **domestic interior** with two standing figures (a man and woman), a small dog, and period-specific furniture/decor. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Human Figures (Foreground)**\n- **Man (Left)**: Tall, wearing a **tall, broad-brimmed black hat** (conical crown, 120px height; brim extends 80px from the head, curved slightly upward). His **floor-length cloak** is dark purple (indigo) with vertical pleats (running from shoulders to hem) and **brown fur trim** (20px wide at the collar, 15px at cuffs, 10px at the hem). Under the cloak, he wears a **black undergarment** (visible at wrists/neck). His **right hand** is raised to chest height (palm forward, fingers slightly curved); his **left hand** grasps the woman’s right hand.  \n- **Woman (Right)**: Slightly shorter (due to the man’s hat), wearing a **full-length emerald-green dress** (loose bodice, full skirt with a 50px-wide ruffled hem). A **dark red belt** (1–2px wide) cinches her waist. Under the dress, a **royal blue underdress** is visible at the cuffs/neck. She wears a **white lace-trimmed head covering** (wrapped around the head, falling to the shoulders) and a **green cape** (matching the dress) with **white fur trim** (15px wide at the collar/cuffs/hem). Her **left hand** rests on a slightly protruding abdomen (suggesting pregnancy); her **right hand** is held by the man’s left hand.\n\n#### **Small Dog (Foreground)**\n- Standing between the figures’ feet (1–2ft in front of the woman’s dress). Shaggy brown fur, short legs, pointed ears, and a curled tail. **Dimensions**: 80px height (floor to top of head), 120px length (nose to tail).\n\n#### **Chandelier (Ceiling, Center-Back)**\n- Gold-colored, with a central stem (150px height) and **six curved arms** (each ending in a candle socket). Intricate scrollwork on the stem (three decorative bands) and arms. **Position**: Centered horizontally above the back wall, 2–3ft above the figures’ heads.\n\n#### **Mirror (Back Wall, Left of Chandelier)**\n- Round, with a **decorative frame** (16 pointed, leaf-like projections extending from the center; dark brown/bronze). **Diameter**: 100px (frame included). The surface reflects a **left window** (leaded glass), a portion of the back wall, and the chandelier’s lower stem.\n\n#### **Window (Left Wall, Above Table)**\n- Rectangular, with **leaded glass panes** (12 rows × 8 columns of small squares, divided by brown metal bars). **Frame**: Wooden (dark brown), 300px height (table to ceiling), 150px width. The **left shutter** is open at a 30° angle (revealing a brick wall outside); the right shutter is closed.\n\n#### **Table (Left Wall, Below Window)**\n- Small, rectangular wooden table (medium brown). **Dimensions**: 60px height (floor to top), 120px width, 60px depth. Holds **three oranges** (round, orange-colored) in a triangular formation (one left, two right).\n\n#### **Chair (Back Wall, Between Mirror/Chandelier)**\n- Red upholstered seat/backrest (smooth matte texture) with a dark brown wooden frame. A **red cloth** is draped over the seat. **Position**: 3–4ft behind the man.\n\n#### **Curtains (Right Wall, Behind Woman)**\n- Floor-length crimson red (bright matte), hanging from a wooden rod. **Dimensions**: 600px height (ceiling to floor), 200px width. Loose folds fall to the floor, covering the right wall.\n\n#### **Shoes (Floor, Left of Man)**\n- Two pairs: **tan leather shoes** (pointed toes, laces) and **brown leather shoes** (similar style). Scattered loosely, with tan shoes overlapping brown ones. **Position**: 1–2ft in front of the table, toes pointing toward the man/window.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Man’s Clothing**:  \n  - Hat: Solid black (matte).  \n  - Cloak: Dark purple (indigo) with vertical pleats (textured, linear); fur trim: Brown (shaggy, overlapping lines).  \n  - Undergarment: Black (smooth).  \n- **Woman’s Clothing**:  \n  - Dress: Emerald green (bright matte) with a ruffled hem (multiple layers of small, overlapping folds). Belt: Dark red (1–2px wide).  \n  - Underdress: Royal blue (smooth, visible at cuffs/neck).  \n  - Head Covering: White (lace-like, intricate patterns at edges).  \n  - Cape: Green (matching dress) with white fur trim (thick, shaggy).  \n- **Dog**: Shaggy brown (medium brown with lighter highlights, textured with small lines).  \n- **Chandelier**: Gold (metallic sheen, intricate scrollwork).  \n- **Mirror**: Frame: Dark brown/bronze (matte); surface: Light gray (faint reflection, 50% opacity).  \n- **Window**: Leaded glass: Clear (slight gray tint); frame: Dark brown (wooden grain).  \n- **Furniture**: Table/chair frame: Medium/dark brown (wooden grain); chair upholstery: Crimson red (matte).  \n- **Curtains**: Crimson red (bright matte, loose folds).  \n- **Floor**: Wooden planks (medium brown, diagonal grain, textured with parallel lines).  \n- **Walls**: Left/right walls: Light brown (wooden, textured); back wall: Light beige (smooth matte).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Figures**: The man stands on the **left third** of the image, the woman on the **right third**, facing each other at a 45° angle. Their hands meet in the center (man’s left hand + woman’s right hand).  \n- **Dog**: Between the figures’ feet, closer to the woman (body angled toward her).  \n- **Chandelier**: Centered above the back wall, 2–3ft above the figures’ heads.  \n- **Mirror**: 1–2ft to the left of the chandelier, at eye level with the man (5–6ft from the floor).  \n- **Window**: Upper left quadrant, above the table (1–2ft from the man’s left side).  \n- **Curtains**: Right wall, behind the woman (1–2ft from her back).  \n- **Shoes**: Left of the man, 1–2ft in front of the table.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Period/Style**: Northern Renaissance (15th century, Flemish).  \n- **Realism**: Highly detailed textures (fur, fabric, wood, metal) and lighting (subtle shadows under the chandelier, floor, and figures).  \n- **Linear Perspective**: Floor planks recede toward a vanishing point on the back wall (planks are narrower at the back, wider at the front).  \n- **Symbolism**:  \n  - **Dog**: Fidelity (loyalty in marriage).  \n  - **Mirror**: Vanity/reflection of reality (faint reflection of the room).  \n  - **Oranges**: Prosperity (rare in 15th-century Flanders).  \n  - **Fur Trim**: Wealth (expensive, indicating high social status).  \n  - **Woman’s Abdomen**: Fertility/domestic bliss (slightly protruding, suggesting pregnancy).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Inscription (Above Mirror)**: A small, gold Gothic script: *“JAN VAN EYCK FUIT HIC 1434”* (Jan van Eyck was here 1434). Curved along the top of the mirror frame (use `<textPath>` in SVG to follow the curve).  \n- **Mirror Reflection**: Faint (50% opacity) reflection of the left window (leaded glass), back wall, and chandelier stem. No additional figures are visible.  \n- **Woman’s Dress Hem**: 50px wide, with multiple layers of small, overlapping folds (textured with small lines).  \n- **Chandelier Arms**: Each arm curves downward from the stem, ending in a cup-like socket (for candles).  \n- **Window Shutters**: Left shutter open at 30° (revealing a brick wall outside); right shutter closed.  \n- **Oranges**: Three in total, irregularly shaped with subtle shadows (indicating roundness).  \n- **Shoes**: Tan shoes (pointing toward the man) overlap brown shoes (pointing toward the window).  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric Details and Proportions (for SVG)**\n- **Image Dimensions**: Vertical rectangle (3:2 ratio, e.g., 900px height × 600px width).  \n- **Man’s Cloak**: 600px length (shoulders to floor), 300px width (hem). Fur trim: 20px (collar), 15px (cuffs), 10px (hem).  \n- **Woman’s Dress**: 650px length (shoulders to floor, including ruffled hem), 400px width (hem).  \n- **Floor Planks**: Diagonal perspective (narrower at the back, wider at the front). Use `transform=\"scale(0.8, 1)\"` for back planks to create depth.  \n- **Curtains**: Loose folds created with `d` attributes in `<path>` (e.g., `M0 0 Q100 50 200 0` for a single fold).  \n\n\n### **7. SVG-Specific Notes for Realism**\n- **Textures**:  \n  - **Fur**: Use a `<pattern>` element with small, overlapping lines (e.g., `<line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"10\" stroke=\"brown\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>` repeated).  \n  - **Wood**: Use a `<pattern>` with diagonal grain lines (e.g., `<line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"10\" stroke=\"dark brown\" stroke-width=\"0.5\"/>`).  \n  - **Mirror Reflection**: Use a `<mask>` or `<filter>` to reduce opacity (50%) and add a slight blur (e.g., `<filter id=\"blur\"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"1\"/></filter>`).  \n- **Lighting/Shadows**:  \n  - **Light Source**: Soft, diffused light from the left window.  \n  - **Shadows**: Add subtle shadows (10–20px wide) to the **right side of the man’s cloak**, **left side of the woman’s dress**, and **under the chandelier** (use `<rect>` with `fill=\"black\"` and 20% opacity).  \n- **Perspective**: Use `transform=\"rotate(-10deg) scale(0.9)\"` for the table to align with the floor’s diagonal perspective.  \n\n\n### **8.

  "v1_185": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this traditional Chinese painting (likely a section of a *Qingming Shanghe Tu*-style work), the following detailed description breaks down geometric shapes, color palettes, spatial relationships, and artistic conventions. Every element is documented for precision in vector-based recreation.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is a **horizontal scroll** (wide, narrow format) centered on a **large stone arch bridge** spanning a river, with dense human activity (markets, crowds) and pastoral/urban landscapes extending to the horizon. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Central Bridge**\n- **Structure**: A high, semicircular stone arch (slightly flattened at the apex for visual balance) with a **curved roof** (thatched or tiled) spanning its length. The arch’s base is supported by thick stone piers on both riverbanks.\n- **Railings**: Low, continuous stone or wooden railings along both sides of the bridge, with vertical posts spaced evenly (≈15–20 posts per side).\n- **Roof**: Parallel, diagonal thatch/tiles running along the curve of the arch, with vertical support beams (≈10–12 per side) connecting the roof to the bridge deck.\n- **Activity**:密集 (dense) crowds on the deck—small human figures (≈1–2px tall at 100% scale) walking, standing, or gathered around stalls. Stalls with awnings line the **left entrance** of the bridge (near the left bank).\n\n#### **River**\n- **Shape**: A wide, meandering channel flowing from the background (top-center) to the foreground (bottom-center). The width narrows slightly as it recedes.\n- **Key Feature**: A **large wooden boat** (≈1/4 the bridge’s width) floating under the arch on the **right side** of the river. The boat has a long, rectangular hull, 3–4 vertical masts (with rolled-up sails), and tiny figures on deck.\n- **Minor Boats**: 2–3 smaller boats in the distant background (top-right), barely distinguishable.\n\n#### **Riverbanks & Foreground**\n- **Left Bank**: A busy market district with:\n  - **Stalls**: 5–6 open-air stalls with triangular awnings (light brown) and goods (e.g., baskets, bundles) displayed.\n  - **Buildings**: 4–5 low-slung structures with **thatched roofs** (dark brown) and **adobe walls** (light tan). One building has a extended awning supported by wooden posts.\n  - **Crowds**: Clusters of people (10–15 per cluster) walking, bargaining, or carrying goods (e.g., poles with baskets).\n- **Right Bank**: Sparser development with:\n  - **Trees**: 3–4 large deciduous trees (oval canopies, dark green) with thin trunks (brown).\n  - **Buildings**: 2–3 small huts (thatched roofs) and a long, low wall (stone, gray) running parallel to the river.\n- **Foreground**: A border of **dense trees** (6–8) with rounded canopies (sage green) at the bottom of the image, framing the scene. Below them, a low stone wall (gray) and a few small buildings (tiled roofs) are partially visible.\n\n#### **Background (Horizon & Distant Landscape)**\n- **Plains**: A vast, flat expanse filling the top 1/3 of the image, covered in:\n  - **Trees**: Hundreds of tiny, clustered trees (moss green) with minimal detail (atmospheric perspective).\n  - **Buildings**: Distant villages—small rectangular structures (tiled roofs, dark brown) and walled compounds (gray) scattered across the plain.\n  - **Crowds**: Thousands of tiny figures (≈0.5px tall) moving in groups—some on horseback, some walking—creating a sense of scale.\n- **Distant Hills**: A faint, low ridge (light tan) at the very top of the image, barely distinguishable from the sky.\n- **Sky**: No distinct sky—merged with the plain using the same warm base color (aged paper), with subtle fading to indicate depth.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **muted and earthy**, consistent with aged traditional Chinese paintings. All colors are desaturated to mimic the yellowed paper of an old scroll.\n\n| Element                | Color Palette                                  | Texture Notes                                                                 |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Base Paper**         | #E8D4A8 (warm yellow-brown)                    | Subtle grain/noise texture (≈5% opacity) to simulate aged paper.              |\n| **Bridge**             | Arch: #B59A73 (light stone brown); Roof: #8C6E46 (dark thatch); Railings: #7A5E3D (wooden) | Roof has parallel diagonal strokes (1px wide) for thatch texture.              |\n| **River**              | #A2A89A (dull gray-green)                      | Horizontal, wavy strokes (0.5px wide, 10% opacity) to indicate water flow.     |\n| **Trees**              | Canopies: #6B7A5C (sage green) to #4F5A3E (olive); Trunks: #8C6E46 (brown) | Canopies have textured brushstrokes (varying opacity) for depth.               |\n| **Buildings**          | Roofs: #7A5E3D (dark brown); Walls: #D1B98E (tan); Awnings: #B59A73 (light brown) | Roofs have parallel lines (1px wide) for tile/thatched texture.                |\n| **People**             | Clothes: #3E5A7A (navy), #8A3E3E (burgundy), #A2A89A (gray); Skin: #D1B98E (tan) | Small, solid-color shapes (circles for heads, rectangles for bodies).          |\n| **Ground/Vegetation**  | Grass: #8C9A73 (moss green); Dirt: #B59A73 (light brown) | Grass has short, vertical strokes (0.5px wide) for texture.                    |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **flat perspective** (no linear perspective) but creates depth through:\n- **Overlapping**: Foreground trees obscure the tops of distant buildings; the bridge overlaps the river and background plains.\n- **Size Variation**: Distant elements (e.g., background trees, people) are 1/2–1/4 the size of foreground elements.\n- **Color Fading**: Background elements (plains, distant trees) are lighter and less saturated than foreground elements (trees, buildings).\n\n#### **Key Layout Rules**\n- **Bridge**: Centered horizontally, spanning from the left bank (1/4 of the image width from the left) to the right bank (1/4 from the right). The arch’s apex is at 1/3 of the image height (from the top).\n- **River**: Flows beneath the bridge, with the left bank occupying the left 1/3 of the image and the right bank the right 1/3. The boat is positioned under the arch’s right half.\n- **Foreground**: Trees and buildings at the bottom 1/5 of the image frame the scene, leading the eye to the bridge.\n- **Background**: Plains extend from the top of the bridge to the image’s top edge, with distant hills at the very top.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe painting follows **gongbi** (fine brushwork) tradition, with:\n- **Precision**: Fine, detailed lines (1px wide or less) for architectural details (bridge railings, building edges) and human figures.\n- **Atmospheric Perspective**: Distant elements (plains, trees) are rendered with softer edges and lighter colors to simulate depth.\n- **Balanced Composition**: The bridge acts as a focal point, with symmetrically placed crowds and vegetation on both sides of the river.\n- **Minimal Negative Space**: The “sky” is merged with the background plains, using the base paper color to avoid empty space.\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**\n#### **Geometric Shapes**\n- **Bridge Arch**: A perfect semicircle (radius = 1/3 image height) with a flattened apex (10% of radius removed) for a more natural look.\n- **Bridge Roof**: A curved rectangle (width = bridge span, height = 1/10 bridge height) following the arch’s curve, with 10–12 vertical support beams (1px wide) spaced evenly.\n- **Boat**: A rectangle (width = 1/4 bridge span, height = 1/20 image height) with a curved top edge; masts are vertical lines (1px wide) at 1/3 intervals.\n- **Tree Canopies**: Oval shapes (width = 1/10 image width, height = 1/12 image height) for foreground trees; smaller ovals (1/20 width/height) for background trees.\n\n#### **Brushstroke Textures**\n- **Trees**: Use **radial gradients** (light green center to dark green edges) for canopies, with 10–15 short, curved lines (0.5px wide) to simulate leaf clusters.\n- **Roofs**: Parallel diagonal lines (1px wide, 50% opacity) for thatch; parallel horizontal lines for tiles.\n- **Water**: Horizontal, wavy paths (0.5px wide, 10% opacity) repeated across the river, spaced 2–3px apart.\n\n#### **Crowd Details**\n- **People**: Small, simplified shapes:\n  - Heads: Circles (0.5px diameter, #D1B98E).\n  - Bodies: Rectangles (1px tall, 0.5px wide) in solid colors (navy, burgundy, gray).\n  - Groups: Clusters of 5–10 figures, spaced 1–2px apart, to simulate crowds. Avoid individual detail—use color variation to indicate diversity.\n\n#### **Atmospheric Perspective**\n- **Background Trees**: Reduce opacity to 50% and use lighter green (#8B9A7C) to make them appear distant.\n- **Distant People**: Solid-color dots (0.5px diameter) in gray (#A2A89A) to avoid drawing attention from the foreground.\n\n\n### **SVG Layer Structure**\nTo organize elements for easy editing, use the following layer hierarchy (top to bottom):\n1. **Foreground Trees** (topmost layer, obscures distant elements).\n2. **Bridge** (focal point, above river and banks).\n3. **River & Boat** (below bridge, above banks).\n4. **Left Bank (Market)** (below river, above background).\n5. **Right Bank (Trees/Buildings)** (below river, above background).\n6. **Background Plains** (below all, includes distant trees, people, buildings).\n7. **Base Paper** (bottom layer, solid color with noise texture).\n\n\n### **Final Notes for Accuracy**\n- **Scale**: Maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio (e.g., 1920px wide × 1080px tall) for the scroll format.\n- **Opacity**: Use 80–90% opacity for all elements except the base paper (100%) to simulate the translucency of old paint.\n- **Consistency**: Ensure all parallel lines (roof tiles, bridge railings) are perfectly aligned using SVG’s `transform` or `pattern` elements.\n- **Test Render**: Zoom to 100% to check that small elements (people, masts) are visible but not overly detailed—SVG should replicate the painting’s *overall effect* rather than microscopic details.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately recreate the composition, color palette, and artistic style of the original painting, while maintaining the precision required for vector graphics.",

It has a conical shape with a jagged, uneven top (10–15 small peaks) and steep slopes. The base transitions to **rocky outcrops**—irregular, angular polygons (20–30px in size) with sharp edges. To the right of the main mountain, a smaller, rounded hill (1/3 the height of the main mountain) supports a cluster of tall trees.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground: River & Village**  \nA **river/lake** spans the lower 1/4 of the image, flowing from the left (base of the main mountain) to the right. It is bordered by:  \n- **Village**: A cluster of 8–10 rectangular houses on the right bank, surrounded by dense trees. Houses have slightly curved roofs (extending beyond walls) and are grouped in a loose grid.  \n- **Trees**: Scattered tall, thin trees (on the main mountain) and denser, shorter trees (in the village). A few prominent tall trees (3–4) grow on the right slope of the main mountain, near the middle of the image.  \n- **Bridge**: A small, curved structure over a narrow section of the river, connecting the village to the mainland.  \n\n#### **Background: Distant Mountains**  \nThree soft, rounded mountain peaks dominate the left background, with smaller, merged hills extending to the right. These mountains have gentle curves (no sharp edges) and fade into the horizon.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \nThe palette is **grayscale with a warm, aged paper base** (#F0E6D6, a pale beige). Ink tones range from **dark gray** (#333333) for foreground details to **light gray** (#E8E0D2) for distant elements, creating atmospheric depth.  \n\n#### **Textures**  \n- **Mountains**: Defined by **cun strokes** (traditional ink brush marks) for rock texture. The main mountain uses **diagonal/curved parallel lines** (1px thick, 10–50px long) with varying density—denser on steeper slopes (left side) and sparser on gentler slopes (right side). Foreground hills have shorter, more irregular cun strokes (5–20px long).  \n- **Trees**: Tall, thin trunks (1–2px thick, 10–40px tall) with small, dark gray foliage (2–10px diameter circles/dots). Denser village trees have thicker trunks (2–3px) and larger foliage clusters.  \n- **Water**: Subtle **horizontal ripples** (1px thick, 10–50px long) with varying spacing—more concentrated near the right shore (village) and sparser in the middle.  \n- **Paper**: A subtle aged texture (optional in SVG, e.g., a noise filter on the background rectangle).  \n\n#### **Visual Properties**  \n- **Atmospheric Perspective**: Distant mountains are lighter, less detailed, and have softer edges. Foreground elements (main mountain, village) are darker and more textured.  \n- **Ink Wash**: Varying brush pressure creates gradations—darker lines for foreground contours, lighter washes for background mountains.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe composition follows **atmospheric perspective** and uses the **rule of thirds** for balance:  \n- **Foreground (0–1/3 of image height)**: Main mountain (left 1/3) and rocky hills (center). The mountain extends from the bottom left to the top center (2/3 of the image height).  \n- **Middle Ground (1/3–2/3 of image height)**: River (bottom 1/4) and village (right 1/3). The river connects the foreground (left) to the village (right), acting as a visual bridge.  \n- **Background (2/3–full height)**: Distant mountains (left 1/3 to right 1/3). These merge into the horizon, framing the upper half of the image.  \n\n#### **Key Proportions (Assumed 1000px × 500px Canvas)**  \n- **Main Mountain**: 350px tall (bottom to top), 200px wide at the base. Jagged top with 10–15 peaks.  \n- **Foreground Hills**: 150px tall, 300px wide (center).  \n- **River**: 125px tall (bottom 1/4), spanning full width.  \n- **Village**: 100px tall (125–225px from bottom), 400px wide (600–1000px from left).  \n- **Distant Mountains**: Left peaks (50–70px tall, 100–150px wide); right hills (30–50px tall, 80–120px wide).  \n\n#### **Positioning**  \n- **Main Mountain**: Left third of the canvas, anchored at the bottom left.  \n- **Village**: Right third, between the river (below) and distant mountains (above).  \n- **Distant Mountains**: Span the entire width of the background, with left peaks more prominent than right hills.  \n- **Trees**: Tall trees cluster on the right slope of the main mountain (middle ground); dense trees surround the village (middle ground).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \nThe image is a classic example of **shanshui (mountain-water) painting**, a traditional Chinese genre focused on nature. Key stylistic elements:  \n- **Ink Medium**: Monochrome ink on paper, with a focus on line (cun strokes) and wash (tonal gradation).  \n- **Dry Brush Technique**: Used for cun strokes, creating a rough, textured appearance that mimics rock surfaces.  \n- **Non-Linear Perspective**: Unlike Western linear perspective, depth is conveyed through tone, detail, and overlapping (e.g., foreground hills overlap the main mountain’s base).  \n- **Balance**: The composition balances empty space (sky, water) with filled space (mountains, village). The main mountain (left) and village (right) are visually balanced by the river (center).  \n- **Human-Nature Harmony**: The village is small and integrated with nature (surrounded by trees), reflecting Taoist ideals.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Rendering**  \nTo ensure accuracy in SVG, below are geometric and stylistic specifications for key elements:  \n\n#### **Main Mountain**  \n- **Shape**: A jagged polygon (10–15 vertices) with a narrow, pointed top and a wide base.  \n- **Contour**: A dark gray (#333333) line (1.5px thick) for the outer edge.  \n- **Texture**: Diagonal/curved cun strokes (1px thick, #666666) with varying density:  \n  - Left slope: Parallel diagonal lines (45° from top-left to bottom-right), spaced 2–5px apart.  \n  - Right slope: Curved lines following the mountain’s contour, spaced 5–10px apart.  \n- **Rocky Outcrops**: Irregular polygons (20–30px) at the base, filled with medium gray (#999999) and outlined in dark gray (#333333).  \n\n#### **Village**  \n- **Houses**: 8–10 rectangles (10–15px wide × 5–10px tall) with:  \n  - Walls: Light gray (#CCCCCC) fill, dark gray (#333333) outline (1px).  \n  - Roofs: Curved dark gray (#333333) lines (1px thick) extending 1–2px beyond the walls.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image is a **horizontal scroll** (typical of Chinese painting) with a **2:1 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1000px wide × 500px tall). Use the following coordinates (relative to image width `W` and height `H`) for precise layout:\n\n#### **Left Group (3 Men)**\nArranged in a diagonal line (left-to-right, bottom-to-top) to create depth.  \n- **Man 1**: `(0.10W, 0.60H)` to `(0.20W, 0.95H)` (width: 0.10W, height: 0.35H).  \n- **Man 2**: `(0.18W, 0.55H)` to `(0.28W, 0.95H)` (overlaps Man 1 by 0.02W).  \n- **Man 3**: `(0.25W, 0.50H)` to `(0.35W, 0.95H)` (tallest in the left group; overlaps Man 2 by 0.03W).  \n\n#### **Right Group (11 Figures)**\nCentered on the **Emperor** (0.65W, 0.70H), with attendants forming a **semi-circle** (back row: tallest, front row: shortest).  \n- **Emperor**: `(0.60W, 0.50H)` to `(0.70W, 0.95H)` (tallest figure; focal point).  \n- **Fan Bearers (Back Row)**:  \n  - Left: `(0.50W, 0.55H)` to `(0.60W, 0.95H)` (holds left fan).  \n  - Right: `(0.70W, 0.55H)` to `(0.80W, 0.95H)` (holds right fan).  \n- **Front Row (3 Women)**:  \n  - Left: `(0.58W, 0.70H)` to `(0.66W, 0.95H)`.  \n  - Center: `(0.63W, 0.70H)` to `(0.71W, 0.95H)` (overlaps Emperor by 0.02W).  \n  - Right: `(0.68W, 0.70H)` to `(0.76W, 0.95H)`.  \n- **Middle Row (4 Women)**:  \n  - Left: `(0.52W, 0.60H)` to `(0.60W, 0.95H)` (flanks Fan Bearer Left).  \n  - Right: `(0.72W, 0.60H)` to `(0.80W, 0.95H)` (flanks Fan Bearer Right).  \n  - Center Left: `(0.55W, 0.65H)` to `(0.63W, 0.95H)` (overlaps Front Row Left).  \n  - Center Right: `(0.67W, 0.65H)` to `(0.75W, 0.95H)` (overlaps Front Row Right).  \n- **Flag Bearer (Far Right)**: `(0.85W, 0.50H)` to `(0.93W, 0.95H)` (tallest attendant; holds flag at `(0.85W, 0.10H)` to `(0.98W, 0.30H)`).  \n\n#### **Ceremonial Objects**\n- **Large Fans**: Positioned above the Emperor to create a \"canopy\" effect.  \n  - Left Fan: `(0.50W, 0.20H)` to `(0.65W, 0.50H)` (width: 0.15W, height: 0.30H). Pole extends from the fan’s bottom center to the Fan Bearer’s hands (`(0.55W, 0.55H)`).  \n  - Right Fan: `(0.65W, 0.15H)` to `(0.80W, 0.45H)` (tilts slightly right; overlaps Left Fan by 0.05W). Pole extends to the Right Fan Bearer’s hands (`(0.75W, 0.55H)`).  \n- **Red Flag**: `(0.85W, 0.10H)` to `(0.98W, 0.30H)` (width: 0.13W, height: 0.20H). Pole extends from the flag’s bottom center to the Flag Bearer’s hands (`(0.89W, 0.50H)`).  \n\n#### **Text/Seals**\n- **Vertical Label**: `(0.45W, 0.10H)` to `(0.55W, 0.25H)` (centered at top; width: 0.10W, height: 0.15H).  \n- **Seals**:  \n  - Top Left: `(0.05W, 0.05H)` to `(0.15W, 0.15H)` (smallest seal).  \n  - Middle Left: `(0.10W, 0.35H)` to `(0.20W, 0.45H)` (largest seal).  \n  - Top Center (Above Label): `(0.40W, 0.02H)` to `(0.45W, 0.07H)` (tiny seal).  \n  - Bottom Right: `(0.80W, 0.85H)` to `(0.90W, 0.95H)` (medium seal).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe painting follows the **Tang dynasty *gongbi* (meticulous) style**, characterized by:  \n- **Fine Line Work**: Use thin, precise strokes (`1–2px` width) for robes, hair, and accessories. For example, the Emperor’s robe has subtle fold lines (`#604020`), and the women’s hair has delicate strands (`#000000`).  \n- **Subtle Shading**: Gradients on robes (light at the cuffs/shoulders, dark at the waist/hem) to simulate volume. Avoid harsh shadows—*gongbi* uses \"boneless\" (wú gǔ) shading (soft transitions).  \n- **Balanced Composition**: The left group (small, compact) balances the right group (large, spread out). The Emperor (central figure) is the focal point, with the large fans and red flag directing the viewer’s eye to him.  \n- **Aged Aesthetic**: The background has a yellowed, worn look (simulate with a `#E0C080` base + 5% noise filter). Seals and the vertical label are placed asymmetrically (typical of Chinese painting) to add \"life\" to the composition.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Vertical Label**: The text is **vertical** (traditional Chinese reading order) and uses a **Songti** (宋体) font (e.g., \"步辇图\" for *Bu Nian Tu*). The label is a red rectangle with black text, positioned at the top center.  \n- **Seals**: The seals use **seal script** (zhuàn shū), a decorative font for official marks. The text is white (`#FFFFFF`) on a red background (`#FF0000`). Common seals include the artist’s signature (e.g., \"阎立本\") or collector marks (e.g., \"乾隆御览之宝\" for Emperor Qianlong’s collection).  \n- **Robe Details**:  \n  - The left man 3’s red robe has a **high collar** (typical of Tang officials) and wide sleeves.  \n  - The women’s robes are **floor-length** (cover their feet) and have a **loose fit** (typical of Tang court attire).  \n- **Hair Details**:  \n  - Men’s *futou* hats have a **round top** and a **small brim** (folded forward).  \n  - Women’s hair is styled in **high buns** (jiu jian bun) with a **hairpin** (`#D0B080`) at the base.  \n- **Sword Details**: The left man 2’s sword has a **curved sheath** (typical of Tang military swords) and a **round hilt** (sienna color). The sword is attached to a black belt (`#000000`) at his left hip.  \n\n\n### **Key SVG Notes for Reproduction**\n- **Groups**: Organize elements into groups (e.g., `#left-group`, `#right-group`, `#fans`, `#seals`) for easy editing.  \n- **Paths**: Use `path` elements for robes, hats, and accessories (avoid `rect`/`circle` for organic shapes). For example, the women’s buns are `path` elements with a `Q` (quadratic) curve to simulate roundness.  \n- **Gradients**: Use `linearGradient` for robes (e.g., `from #FF0000 to #800000` for the left man 3’s red robe) and `radialGradient` for the Emperor’s hat (subtle shine).  \n- **Text**: Use `text` elements for the vertical label and seals. For the label, set `writing-mode: vertical-rl` (CSS) to align text vertically. For seals, use a **seal script** font (e.g., \"Adobe Heiti Std\" or \"STXingkai\").  \n- **Texture**: Add a `filter` to the background (e.g., `url(#noise-filter)`) to simulate aged silk. The filter can be a `feTurbulence` element with `baseFrequency=\"0.02\"` and `type=\"fractalNoise\"`.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical SVG Components**\n| Component | SVG Elements | Key Properties |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Background** | `<rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#E0C080\"/>` | `filter=\"url(#noise-filter)\"` |\n| **Left Group** | `<g id=\"left-group\">` | Contains 3 `<g>` elements (men), each with `<path>` (robe), `<rect>` (hat/boots), `<path>` (sword). |\n| **Right Group** | `<g id=\"right-group\">` | Contains 11 `<g>` elements (Emperor + attendants), `<path>` (fans), `<path>` (flag). |\n| **Text/Seals** | `<g id=\"text-seals\">` | Contains `<rect>` (label), `<text>` (label text), `<rect>` (seals), `<text>` (seal text). |\n| **Filters** | `<filter id=\"noise-filter\">` | `<feTurbulence baseFrequency=\"0.02\" type=\"fractalNoise\" result=\"noise\"/>` + `<feBlend mode=\"multiply\" in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\"/>` |\n\n\nBy following this detailed description, you can recreate the image as an accurate, vector-based SVG that preserves the artistic integrity of the original Tang dynasty masterpiece. The key is to prioritize **precision in layout**, **subtlety in shading**, and **authenticity in cultural details** (e.g., robe styles, seal placement).",
  "v1_188": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this close-up image of a branch with leaves and a fruit, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into measurable, vector-friendly elements. The focus is on **geometric precision**, **color specificity**, **spatial hierarchy**, and **textural details** necessary for realistic vectorization.\n\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image is a **close-up of a plant branch** with foreground foliage, a young fruit, and blurred background vegetation. Key elements include:\n\n#### Foreground (Sharp, In-Focus)\n- **Two Primary Leaves**:  \n  - **Bottom Leaf**: Largest element (≈6cm long, 2.5cm wide), oval with a slightly wavy, serrated edge (30–35 small, pointed teeth evenly spaced). A small, triangular缺口 (5mm wide, 3mm deep) is present on the left edge.  \n  - **Top Leaf**: Smaller (≈4cm long, 1.8cm wide), overlapping the bottom leaf’s upper third. Similar oval shape with serrated edges but no visible damage.  \n  - **Veins**: Both leaves have a thick, straight central vein (2mm wide at the base, thinning to 1mm at the tip) and 8–10 lateral veins branching at 45–60° angles (thinning from 1mm to 0.5mm). Veins are raised, creating a textured appearance.  \n\n- **Fruit**: Small (≈1.5cm diameter), round-oval drupe (likely a young apple/pear) attached to a thin, green stem (1cm long, 1mm diameter) at the top. A tiny, brown calyx (3mm wide) surrounds the stem base. The fruit has a fuzzy, matte surface.  \n\n- **Main Branch**: Diagonal (from top-left to center), cylindrical (5mm diameter at the top, tapering to 3mm at the bottom). Rough, bark-like texture with small bumps/cracks.  \n\n#### Background (Blurred, Out-of-Focus)\n- **Secondary Branches**: Thin (1–2mm diameter), green, branching from the main stem.  \n- **Leaves**: 4–6 oval shapes (2–3cm long), varying in size. Blurred to create depth, with soft edges and less defined details.  \n\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nAll colors are specified as **hex codes** for precision. Textures are described in terms of vector-replicable techniques (gradients, patterns, blur).\n\n#### Foreground Leaves\n- **Base Color**: Medium green (#6BA051) with a matte finish.  \n- **Veins**: Darker green (#5A803F) to simulate raised texture.  \n- **Spots**:  \n  - **Large**: Irregular red-orange (#D96B3D) with subtle yellow halos (#F0D040) (1–2cm wide).  \n  - **Small**: Scattered brown dots (#3D502F) (1–2mm diameter).  \n- **Lighting**: Upper surface (facing light) is lighter (#7BA051); lower surface is darker (#6B9041) to mimic natural shading.  \n\n#### Fruit\n- **Base Color**: Purple-red (#A05252) with a radial gradient fading to light red (#C08080) at the edges (simulates fuzz).  \n- **Highlight**: Pale pink (#E0C0C0) on the upper-right quadrant (soft natural light source).  \n- **Calyx**: Brown (#8B5A2B) with a rough texture.  \n\n#### Branch\n- **Mature Wood**: Dark brown (#8B5A2B) with a subtle gradient to light brown (#A07040) on the upper surface (catch light).  \n- **Texture**: Rough bark simulated with a 1px dashed stroke (#654321) or a low-opacity noise pattern.  \n\n#### Background\n- **Leaves**: Bright green (#8BC34A) with 70% opacity and a **Gaussian blur (σ=2px)** to mimic out-of-focus blur.  \n- **Branches**: Light green (#8BC34A) with 50% opacity.  \n\n#### Lighting\n- **Source**: Soft natural light from the **upper-right**, creating:  \n  - **Highlights**: Pale pink (#E0C0C0) on the fruit; lighter green (#7BA051) on leaf upper surfaces.  \n  - **Shadows**: Darker green (#6B9041) on leaf lower surfaces; deep brown (#654321) in branch crevices.  \n\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nSpatial hierarchy is critical for recreating depth. All measurements are **relative to the image’s total width** (assumed to be 10cm for scaling).\n\n#### Foreground\n- **Bottom Leaf**: Occupies the lower 1/3 of the image, centered horizontally. The缺口 is on the left edge, 1cm from the base.  \n- **Top Leaf**: Overlaps the bottom leaf’s upper 1/3, positioned 1cm to the right of the center.  \n- **Fruit**: Above the top leaf, 2cm from the top edge, centered horizontally. The stem attaches to the main branch 1cm below the fruit.  \n- **Main Branch**: Runs diagonally from the top-left corner (1cm from the edge) to the center (5cm from the left).  \n\n#### Background\n- **Secondary Branches**: Branch from the main stem at 30–60° angles, extending to the right/left.  \n- **Leaves**: Positioned behind the foreground elements, 3–5cm from the top/bottom edges. Blurred to avoid competing with the focal point.  \n\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe image is a **realistic close-up photo**, so the SVG must prioritize:  \n- **Depth of Field**: Sharp foreground (leaves, fruit, branch) vs. blurred background (use Gaussian blur on background elements).  \n- **Textural Realism**:  \n  - **Leaves**: Veins (darker green) and spots (irregular shapes) to mimic natural damage.  \n  - **Fruit**: Fuzzy texture (radial gradient + subtle noise pattern).  \n  - **Branch**: Rough bark (stroke patterns/gradients).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, directional light (upper-right) to create highlights/shadows, enhancing three-dimensionality.  \n\n\n### 5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction\nThese details are critical for accuracy and must be included in the vector file:  \n- **Leaf Serrations**: Each tooth is a small triangle (1mm wide, 0.5mm tall), evenly spaced along the edge. Use the `stroke-linecap: round` property for soft edges.  \n- **Leaf缺口**: Triangular shape (5mm wide, 3mm deep) on the left edge of the bottom leaf.  \n- **Fruit Calyx**: 3–4 small, scale-like shapes (#8B5A2B) surrounding the stem base.  \n- **Branch Texture**: Add a 1px dashed stroke (#654321) along the main branch to simulate cracks/bumps.  \n- **Blur**: Apply Gaussian blur (σ=2px) to all background elements (leaves, branches) to replicate depth of field.  \n- **Veins**: Draw lateral veins as thin (0.5–1mm) lines branching from the central vein, thinning as they reach the leaf edges.  \n\n\n### Summary for SVG Workflow\n1. **Draw Shapes**: Use `path` elements for leaves (serrated edges), `circle` for the fruit, `line`/`path` for branches.  \n2. **Apply Colors/Gradients**: Use `fill` with hex codes; add radial gradients for the fruit’s fuzz and linear gradients for leaf veins.  \n3. **Add Textures**: Use `stroke` patterns for the branch, `mask` with noise for the fruit’s fuzz.  \n4. **Depth of Field**: Apply `filter: blur(2px)` to background elements; keep foreground elements sharp.  \n5. **Lighting**: Use `linear-gradient` for leaf shading (upper/lower surfaces) and `radial-gradient` for fruit highlights.  \n\nBy following these specifications, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s realism, depth, and detail while maintaining the scalability of vector graphics.",
  "v1_189": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, below is a detailed breakdown of its components, focusing on **geometric precision**, **textural details**, **color values**, and **spatial relationships**. The image is a close-up of a damaged leaf surrounded by healthier foliage, with a documentary-style focus on natural decay.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects & Shapes**\nThe composition is dominated by a **central, highly damaged leaf** (≈70% of the image area) surrounded by four partially visible, healthier leaves. All leaves are broad, ovate (egg-shaped) with rounded tips and slightly serrated edges (subtle, not sharp).\n\n#### **Central Leaf**\n- **Shape**: Ovate, with a width-to-height ratio of ~1.2:1 (wider than tall). The base tapers to a thin petiole (stem) that merges with the midrib.\n- **Veins**: A prominent **midrib** (central vein) runs vertically through the center, tapering from 3mm wide at the base to 1mm at the tip. **Lateral veins** branch from the midrib at **irregular 30–60° angles**, spacing 5–10mm apart. Veins are raised (visible as raised paths in SVG) and get thinner as they extend toward the leaf edges.\n- **Damage**: \n  - **Holes**: 50–70 irregular cutouts, varying in size (1mm pinpricks to 15mm irregular polygons). Holes are concentrated in the **central/lower third** of the leaf, with larger holes near the midrib and smaller holes toward the edges.\n  - **Edges of Holes**: Ragged, with \"fringed\" margins (use **irregular path points** to avoid smooth edges).\n  - **Necrosis**: A 20mm × 30mm irregular patch of dead tissue in the **bottom center**, merging with yellowish chlorosis (see *Colors* below).\n  - **Small Spots**: ~20 tiny (1–2mm) black/brown specks (insect frass or fungal spores) scattered near holes and along the midrib.\n\n#### **Surrounding Leaves**\nFour partially visible leaves frame the central leaf, each ovate and less damaged:\n- **Top-left leaf**: Overlaps the central leaf’s top-left edge (≈25% visible). Smooth edges, no significant holes.\n- **Top-right leaf**: Overlaps the central leaf’s top-right edge (≈20% visible). Similar to the top-left leaf.\n- **Bottom-left leaf**: Overlaps the central leaf’s bottom-left edge (≈30% visible). Slight yellowish tint (older tissue).\n- **Bottom-right leaf**: Most visible surrounding leaf (≈40% visible). Bright green, smooth texture, no damage.\n\n#### **Surrounding Foliage**\n- **Background**: Blurred, out-of-focus leaves (soft edges, desaturated green) fill the margins, creating depth.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, & Visual Properties**\nColors are muted but vibrant, with a focus on **natural leaf tones** and **decay-related discoloration**. Textures mimic the rough, veined surface of plant tissue and the dry, matte appearance of damaged areas.\n\n#### **Central Leaf**\n| Area                | Color (Hex/RGB)       | Texture/Notes                                                                 |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Healthy Green Base** | #6B8E23 (107,142,35)  | Slightly glossy; use a **linear gradient** from darker green (#2E8B57) at the bottom-right to lighter green (#6B8E23) at the top-left (mimics top-left lighting). |\n| **Midrib & Veins**    | #90EE90 (144,238,144) | Raised; use a **thicker stroke** (2–3mm at the base, tapering to 1mm at the tip) for the midrib. Lateral veins are 0.5–1mm wide, branching at irregular angles. |\n| **Chlorosis (Yellow Halos)** | #FFFF99 (255,255,153) | Matte; applied as a **1–2mm border** around holes and along leaf margins. Use a gradient from yellow to transparent to blend with the green base. |\n| **Necrosis (Dead Tissue)** | #8B4513 (139,69,19)   | Dry, crumbly; irregular patch in the bottom-center. Use a **texture fill** (e.g., noise filter) or a gradient from dark brown to light brown (#A0522D) for depth. |\n| **Gray Fungal Spots** | #808080 (128,128,128) | Small (1–2mm) irregular shapes/scratches; scattered near holes.               |\n| **Hole Edges**       | #000000 (black)       | Subtle, thin (0.1mm) border to emphasize raggedness (optional, for realism).  |\n\n#### **Surrounding Leaves**\n| Leaf Position       | Color (Hex/RGB)       | Texture/Notes                                                                 |\n|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Top-left/Top-right   | #2E8B57 (46,139,87)   | Bright, glossy; linear gradient from #1E90FF (light blue-green) at the top to #2E8B57 at the bottom (mimics backlighting). |\n| Bottom-left          | #F0E68C (240,230,140) | Pale yellow-green (older leaf); matte texture with subtle vein details.       |\n| Bottom-right         | #32CD32 (50,205,50)   | Vibrant green; smooth, glossy surface with prominent lateral veins (1mm wide). |\n\n#### **Background Leaves**\n- **Color**: #556B2F (85,107,47) (desaturated green).  \n- **Texture**: Blurred (use a **Gaussian blur filter** with σ=2–3) to create depth. Edges are soft and overlapping.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships & Positioning**\nThe central leaf is the focal point, with surrounding leaves framing it in a **loose radial pattern**. All elements are positioned to emphasize the decay of the central leaf.\n\n#### **Central Leaf**\n- **Alignment**: Centered in the image, with the midrib tilted **10° to the right** (not perfectly vertical).  \n- **Hole Distribution**:  \n  - **Large holes** (10–15mm): Concentrated along the midrib (central third of the leaf).  \n  - **Small holes** (1–5mm): Scattered toward the leaf edges and top third.  \n  - **Ragged edges**: Holes near the midrib have more irregular outlines; edges toward the leaf margin are slightly smoother.  \n- **Overlap**: The central leaf is overlapped by surrounding leaves at:  \n  - Top-left edge (10% coverage).  \n  - Top-right edge (15% coverage).  \n  - Bottom-left edge (5% coverage).  \n  - Bottom-right edge (20% coverage).  \n\n#### **Surrounding Leaves**\n| Leaf Position       | Placement Relative to Central Leaf | Visibility |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|\n| Top-left             | Overlaps top-left corner; midrib parallel to central leaf’s midrib. | 30%        |\n| Top-right            | Overlaps top-right edge; midrib angled 30° to the right. | 25%        |\n| Bottom-left          | Overlaps bottom-left edge; midrib angled 20° to the left. | 20%        |\n| Bottom-right         | Overlaps bottom-right edge; midrib vertical (perpendicular to central leaf’s midrib). | 40%        |\n\n#### **Depth Hierarchy**\n1. **Central leaf** (foreground): Most detailed, highest contrast.  \n2. **Bottom-right leaf** (foreground): Second most detailed, overlaps the central leaf’s bottom edge.  \n3. **Top-left/Top-right leaves** (midground): Less detailed, softer edges.  \n4. **Background leaves** (background): Blurred, desaturated, least detailed.\n\n\n### **4. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **documentary/referential style** with a focus on **natural realism**. Key artistic choices for SVG:\n- **Irregularity**: All leaves, veins, and holes have imperfect, organic shapes (avoid perfect symmetry or straight lines).  \n- **Texture Variation**: Use **gradient fills** for healthy foliage (glossy) and **solid/matte fills** for damaged areas (dry).  \n- **Lighting**: A subtle top-left light source creates highlights on the central leaf’s top edge and shadows on the bottom-right. Mimic this with linear gradients (lighter on the top-left, darker on the bottom-right).  \n- **Depth**: Use **blur filters** for background leaves and **layer stacking** (central leaf on top, surrounding leaves below) to create a 3D effect.  \n- **Focus**: The central leaf has the highest detail (sharp veins, ragged holes); surrounding leaves are slightly softer (reduce stroke width for veins, use fewer details).\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these critical elements:\n- **Holes**: Use **`<path>` elements** with 8–12 irregular points per hole (avoid circles/squares). For example, a large hole near the midrib might have a path like:  \n  `<path d=\"M300 200 Q320 180 340 210 Q360 230 330 250 Q310 240 290 220 Z\" fill=\"none\" />`  \n  Add a **yellow halo** (1–2mm) around each hole using a nested path with a yellow fill.  \n- **Veins**: For the central leaf, draw the midrib as a **thick path** (2–3mm) with a linear gradient (pale green to lighter green). Lateral veins are **thinner paths** (0.5–1mm) branching from the midrib at 30–60° angles; use a **dashed stroke** (optional) for subtlety.  \n- **Necrosis Patch**: Create an irregular **`<polygon>`** or **`<path>`** in the bottom-center of the central leaf. Apply a **brown gradient** (dark brown to light brown) and a **noise filter** (SVG `<filter>`) to mimic texture.  \n- **Small Spots**: Use **`<circle>`** or **`<rect>`** elements (1–2mm) with a gray fill; scatter them near holes and along the midrib.  \n- **Blurring Background Leaves**: Apply a **Gaussian blur filter** to background leaves (e.g., `<filter id=\"blur\"><feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"2\" /></filter>`).  \n\n\n### **6. Key SVG Structure & Proportions**\nFor a 1000px × 1000px SVG canvas:\n- **Central Leaf**:  \n  - Width: 700px (70% of canvas).  \n  - Height: 600px (60% of canvas).  \n  - Midrib: 3mm wide at the base (bottom-center), tapering to 1mm at the tip (top-center).  \n- **Surrounding Leaves**:  \n  - Bottom-right leaf: 400px wide × 300px tall (40% of canvas).  \n  - Top-left leaf: 300px wide × 250px tall (30% of canvas).  \n- **Holes**:  \n  - Largest hole: 15mm × 10mm (irregular).  \n  - Smallest hole: 1mm × 1mm (pinprick).  \n\n\n### **7. Example SVG Snippets**\nBelow are simplified code snippets to illustrate critical elements:\n\n#### **Central Leaf with Midrib & Hole**\n```svg\n<g id=\"central-leaf\">\n  <!-- Base leaf shape (ovate) -->\n  <path d=\"M200 800 Q400 700 500 100 Q600 700 800 800 Z\" fill=\"url(#central-leaf-gradient)\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"0.5\" />\n  \n  <!-- Midrib (pale green, tapered) -->\n  <path d=\"M500 800 Q500 600 500 100\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#90EE90\" stroke-width=\"3\" stroke-linecap=\"round\">\n    <animate attributeName=\"stroke-width\" from=\"3\" to=\"1\" dur=\"0s\" fill=\"freeze\" /> <!-- Taper effect -->\n  </path>\n  \n  <!-- Large hole with yellow halo -->\n  <g id=\"large-hole\">\n    <!-- Yellow halo (1mm border) -->\n    <path d=\"M450 500 Q470 480 490 500 Q470 520 450 500 Z\" fill=\"#FFFF99\" />\n    <!-- Hole cutout -->\n    <path d=\"M455 500 Q475 485 485 500 Q475 515 455 500 Z\" fill=\"none\" />\n  </g>\n</g>\n```\n\n#### **Gradient for Healthy Leaf**\n```svg\n<defs>\n  <linearGradient id=\"central-leaf-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"1\">\n    <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#6B8E23\" /> <!-- Top-left (light) -->\n    <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#2E8B57\" /> <!-- Bottom-right (dark) -->\n  </linearGradient>\n</defs>\n```\n\n#### **Necrosis Patch with Texture**\n```svg\n<g id=\"necrosis\">\n  <path d=\"M350 700 Q400 750 450 700 Q400 650 350 700 Z\" fill=\"#8B4513\">\n    <filter id=\"noise\">\n      <feTurbulence type=\"fractalNoise\" baseFrequency=\"0.05\" numOctaves=\"3\" result=\"noise\" />\n      <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\" mode=\"multiply\" />\n    </filter>\n  </path>\n</g>\n```\n\n\n### **8. Final Notes for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Layer Order**: Stack elements from **background** (blurred leaves) to **foreground** (central leaf, bottom-right leaf).  \n- **Clipping Masks**: Use clipping paths to ensure surrounding leaves overlap the central leaf correctly (e.g., `<clipPath>` for the bottom-right leaf to hide areas behind the central leaf).  \n- **Performance**: Avoid excessive detail (e.g., limit small holes to 50–70) to keep the SVG lightweight. Use **symbol** elements for repeated shapes (e.g., small holes, spots).  \n\nBy following this breakdown, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s natural texture, damage, and spatial hierarchy while maintaining scalability and editability.",
  "v1_190": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this close-up image of tree resin oozing from bark, the following detailed breakdown of **main elements, colors, spatial relationships, style, and technical specifications** is provided. The description prioritizes geometric precision, texture, and visual hierarchy to ensure fidelity to the original.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **macro close-up** of **tree resin (amber)** oozing from a rough, cracked bark substrate. The composition is centered on the resin, with the bark serving as a textured background. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground: Resin Droplets**  \nThree prominent, glossy resin blobs dominate the scene, with a fourth tiny droplet and subtle secondary formations. All have **organic, irregular shapes** (not perfect spheres) due to gravity and surface tension:  \n- **Central Droplet**: The largest and most forward element. It has an elongated, teardrop-like shape with a rounded top and a slightly flattened base where it adheres to the bark. Dimensions (relative to a 100x100 viewBox): ~20 units wide × 30 units tall.  \n- **Left Upper Droplet**: A smaller, teardrop-shaped blob positioned above and to the left of the central droplet. It tapers at the base and curves slightly toward the center. Dimensions: ~10 units wide × 15 units tall.  \n- **Right Upper Droplet**: Similar to the left upper droplet but more rounded at the top. It sits above and to the right of the central droplet, overlapping the bark. Dimensions: ~12 units wide × 14 units tall.  \n- **Tiny Bottom Droplet**: A minuscule, oval blob at the bottom-left of the central droplet. Dimensions: ~5 units wide × 3 units tall.  \n- **Secondary Resin Strands**: Thin, wispy extensions of resin connecting the central droplet to the upper blobs (e.g., a narrow \"neck\" between the central and right upper droplets).  \n\n#### **Background: Bark Substrate**  \nThe bark is a rough, uneven surface with deep cracks, fibrous strands, and patches of moss. Key features:  \n- **Cracks**: Multiple intersecting, wavy cracks running vertically and diagonally. The most prominent crack starts at the bottom center and branches upward to the right of the central droplet.  \n- **Fibrous Strands**: A thin, curved strand (resembling a small root or bark fiber) running diagonally from the center-right to the bottom-right of the image.  \n- **Moss**: A cluster of small, irregular patches in the lower-left corner, beneath the central droplet.  \n- **Bark Texture**: Raised bumps, indentations, and a \"pebbly\" surface with varying roughness.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is dominated by **warm amber tones** (resin) and **dark, earthy browns** (bark), with subtle green (moss) and neutral accents. Texture is critical to distinguishing the smooth resin from the rough bark.\n\n#### **Resin (Foreground)**  \n- **Base Color**: Translucent amber with a **radial gradient** to simulate thickness:  \n  - **Center**: Deep orange-brown (#CC6600) (thicker, more opaque).  \n  - **Edges**: Light golden yellow (#FFEB99) (thinner, more translucent).  \n- **Gloss/Highlights**: Sharp white (#FFFFFF) highlights on the **top-left curves** of each droplet (simulating light from the top-left). Highlights are small, curved shapes with 50–70% opacity, fading toward the center.  \n- **Air Bubbles**: Tiny, faint white circles (#FFFFFF, 20% opacity) scattered in the central droplet (adds realism to the resin’s viscosity).\n\n#### **Bark (Background)**  \n- **Base Color**: Dark brown (#331A00) with darker cracks (#1A0D00).  \n- **Texture**:  \n  - **Roughness**: Small, irregular \"bump\" shapes (#4D2600, 10% opacity) scattered across the surface.  \n  - **Cracks**: Thin lines (#1A0D00) with subtle width variation (1–2 units) to mimic natural fissures.  \n- **Moss**: Light green (#669966) with a hint of yellow (#99CC66) for depth, shaped as irregular polygons.  \n- **Fibrous Strands**: Tan (#996633) with gray (#666666) accents, curved lines (1–2 units wide) with slight texture (e.g., dashed strokes for roughness).\n\n#### **Depth of Field**  \nThe original image has a **shallow depth of field**, with the resin in sharp focus and the bark edges slightly blurred. For SVG:  \n- **Foreground Resin**: No blur (sharp edges).  \n- **Background Bark**: Apply a **feGaussianBlur** filter to bark elements outside the central 60% of the image, with a standard deviation of 1–2 units (subtle softening).\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **overlapping and z-index** to create depth. All measurements assume a **100x100 viewBox** for scalability.\n\n| Element                | Position (x, y)       | Size (width × height) | Z-Index (Layer) |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n| **Central Resin Droplet** | (40, 50)              | 20 × 30               | 5 (Top)         |\n| **Left Upper Resin Droplet** | (25, 15)           | 10 × 15               | 4               |\n| **Right Upper Resin Droplet** | (65, 10)         | 12 × 14               | 4               |\n| **Tiny Bottom Resin Droplet** | (35, 70)         | 5 × 3                 | 4               |\n| **Bark Cracks**         | (50, 90) → (70, 30)  | 1–2 units wide        | 3               |\n| **Fibrous Strand**      | (60, 50) → (85, 85)  | 1–2 units wide        | 3               |\n| **Moss**                | (15, 75) → (35, 95)  | Irregular             | 3               |\n| **Bark Base**           | (0, 0) → (100, 100)  | 100 × 100             | 1 (Bottom)      |\n\n#### **Key Overlaps**  \n- The central resin droplet overlaps the bark cracks and moss.  \n- The left/right upper resin droplets overlap the central droplet (slightly behind it).  \n- The fibrous strand runs **under** the central droplet but **over** the bark base.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic macro photograph**, so the SVG must prioritize:  \n- **Texture Contrast**: Smooth, glossy resin vs. rough, cracked bark.  \n- **Translucency**: The resin’s transparency allows faint visibility of the bark underneath (use 80–90% opacity for resin).  \n- **Depth**: Overlapping elements and subtle blur on the bark edges (shallow depth of field).  \n- **Organic Shapes**: Avoid perfect circles/squares—resin droplets and bark cracks should have irregular, hand-drawn curves.  \n\n#### **SVG Technical Style Notes**  \n- **Gradients**: Use `<radialGradient>` for resin (center to edge) and `<linearGradient>` for bark (light to dark).  \n- **Filters**: Apply `feGaussianBlur` to background bark and `feSpecularLighting` to resin for added gloss (optional, but enhances realism).  \n- **Groups**: Organize elements into layers (e.g., `<g id=\"resin\">`, `<g id=\"bark\">`, `<g id=\"moss\">`) for easy editing.\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for Accuracy**\nTo capture the image’s nuance, include these small but critical elements:  \n- **Resin Surface Imperfections**: Tiny \"ripples\" on the resin edges (use `<path>` with subtle curve variations).  \n- **Bark Fiber Direction**: The fibrous strand curves slightly to the right (mimic natural growth).  \n- **Moss Clumping**: The moss is not uniform—cluster 3–5 small polygons in the lower-left, with varying sizes.  \n- **Light Direction**: All highlights (resin, bark) should be on the **top-left** to maintain consistent lighting.  \n- **Bark Crack Branching**: The main crack splits into two smaller cracks at (70, 40) (use `<path>` with `d` attribute to create branches).\n\n\n### **SVG Construction Checklist**\nTo ensure fidelity, the final SVG should include:  \n1. **Bark Base**: A `<rect>` with dark brown fill, plus `<path>` elements for cracks and bumps.  \n2. **Resin Droplets**: `<path>` elements with organic shapes, radial gradients, and white highlights.  \n3. **Moss**: `<polygon>` elements with green fill, clustered in the lower-left.  \n4. **Fibrous Strand**: A `<path>` with tan fill, curved from (60, 50) to (85, 85).  \n5. **Filters**: `feGaussianBlur` on background bark, `feSpecularLighting` on resin (optional).  \n6. **Details**: Air bubbles (tiny `<circle>` elements) in the central resin, bark bumps (small `<ellipse>` elements).  \n\n### **Example SVG Snippet (Central Resin Droplet)**\n```xml\n<defs>\n  <radialGradient id=\"resinGradient\" cx=\"0.3\" cy=\"0.2\" r=\"0.7\">\n    <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#CC6600\" stop-opacity=\"1\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#FFEB99\" stop-opacity=\"0.8\"/>\n  </radialGradient>\n  <filter id=\"resinGloss\">\n    <feSpecularLighting result=\"specular\" in=\"SourceGraphic\" specularExponent=\"20\" lighting-color=\"#FFFFFF\">\n      <fePointLight x=\"-50\" y=\"-50\" z=\"200\"/>\n    </feSpecularLighting>\n    <feComposite in=\"specular\" in2=\"SourceGraphic\" operator=\"add\"/>\n  </filter>\n</defs>\n\n<g id=\"resin\">\n  <path d=\"M45 50 Q50 30 60 40 Q55 60 40 70 Q30 60 35 55 Q40 52 45 50\" fill=\"url(#resinGradient)\" filter=\"url(#resinGloss)\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"48\" cy=\"55\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" opacity=\"0.2\"/> <!-- Air bubble -->\n  <path d=\"M42 52 Q45 45 50 48\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" opacity=\"0.5\"/> <!-- Highlight -->\n</g>\n```\n\n\n### **Final Notes**\n- **Scalability**: Use a `viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"` to make the SVG responsive.  \n- **Browser Compatibility**: Test filters (e.g., `feGaussianBlur`) in major browsers—fallback to solid fills if needed.  \n- **Realism**: Adjust gradient stops and opacity values to match the original image’s lighting (e.g., darker resin centers for thickness).  \n\nBy following this description, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s texture, color, and depth, while maintaining the organic, natural feel of the original macro photograph.",
  "v1_191": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed breakdown of **main objects**, **colors/textures**, **spatial relationships**, **style**, and **critical details**—including geometric proportions, gradients, and filter applications. The description prioritizes precision for vector reproduction, with a focus on replicable shapes and visual hierarchy.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image is a close-up of a **foreground focal point** (a green tomato with rot) held by a human hand, surrounded by tomato plant foliage, with a blurred green background. Key elements include:\n\n### Foreground (In Focus)\n#### A. Green Tomato\n- **Shape**: Rounded oblate (slightly flattened top/bottom), with a subtle right-side bulge (imperfect symmetry). Dimensions (approximate for a 1000px × 750px canvas): **400px wide (left-to-right) × 300px tall (top-to-bottom)**.\n- **Rot Spot**: Irregular, jagged \"hole\" on the **upper half** (closer to the stem end). The hole is roughly star-shaped but asymmetric—left edge more jagged, right edge smoother. Dimensions: **150px wide × 120px tall**.\n  - **Layers of Rot**: \n    - Outer edge: Thin, raised brown rim (simulates dried, cracked tissue).\n    - Middle layer: Dark brown/gray decay (irregular texture).\n    - Core: Deep black center with a tiny, light brown \"nub\" (remnant of the blossom end).\n- **Stem**: Small, short stem (10px wide × 20px tall) at the tomato’s top, connecting to:\n  - **Buds**: Two tiny, oval calyx buds (15px wide × 10px tall) with fine, hair-like trichomes (see §4 for details).\n\n#### B. Human Hand (Supporting the Tomato)\n- **Shape**: Adult hand (pale skin) holding the tomato from below.

The palm is roughly 300px wide (from thumb to pinky) and 250px tall (from wrist to fingers).\n\n#### C. Tomato Leaf (Left of Tomato)\n- **Shape**: Compound leaf with a serrated edge (typical of Solanum lycopersicum). Dimensions: **350px wide × 250px tall**, positioned to the **left of the tomato** (overlapping the hand’s thumb).\n  - **Serrations**: Irregular, triangular teeth (10–15px tall) along the leaf margin, with rounded tips.\n  - **Veins**: Prominent, branched veins (midrib + 5–6 lateral veins) raised above the leaf surface.\n- **Condition**: Dark green with **brownish discoloration** on the upper-left edge (simulates sunscorch or disease).\n\n#### D. Plant Buds & Stems\n- **Buds**: Two small, oval buds (15px wide × 10px tall) attached to the tomato’s stem. Covered in fine trichomes (hairs).\n- **Stems**: Thin, green stems (10–15px wide) connecting the leaf and buds to the main plant (blurred in the background).\n\n### Background (Out of Focus)\n- **Blurred Foliage**: Indistinct green shapes (leaves, stems) in varying shades of green. No sharp edges—designed to create depth of field.\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nAll colors are specified as **hex codes** for consistency. Textures are simulated using gradients, opacity, and subtle strokes to avoid raster effects.\n\n### Tomato\n- **Base Color**: Light yellow-green radial gradient (simulates glossy skin):\n  - **Center**: `#F0E68C` (pale lemon-green) – brightest point (highlight).\n  - **Edges**: `#B8D66E` (muted olive-green) – darker to emphasize roundness.\n- **Rot Spot**:\n  - **Outer Rim**: `#8B4513` (saddle brown) – thin, raised edge (use a 1px stroke with `opacity=\"0.8\"`).\n  - **Middle Layer**: `#654321` (dark brown) – irregular fill with `opacity=\"0.9\"`.\n  - **Core**: `#1A1A1A` (black) –凹陷 center (use a radial gradient darker at the center).\n  - **Central Nub**: `#D2B48C` (tan) – 5px diameter circle at the rot’s center.\n- **Gloss**: Small, elliptical highlight on the **upper-right quadrant** (`#FFFFFF`, `opacity=\"0.3\"`) to simulate light reflection.\n\n### Hand\n- **Skin Tone**: Pinkish-beige linear gradient (simulates volume):\n  - **Highlights (Knuckles/Tips)**: `#F5DEB3` (pale peach).\n  - **Shadows (Palm/Finger Creases)**: `#D8B0A0` (muted rose).\n- **Lines**: Palm creases and knuckle lines in `#C0A090` (warm gray), 1px stroke with `opacity=\"0.7\"`.\n  - **Key Lines**: Central palm line (curved from thumb base to middle finger), two lateral lines (index to ring finger, pinky to palm center).\n- **Nails**: Short, rounded nails on the thumb (`#F0D0C0`, `opacity=\"0.8\"`) with a tiny cuticle (`#C0A090`, 1px stroke).\n\n### Leaf\n- **Base Color**: Dark green linear gradient (simulates matte, fuzzy texture):\n  - **Top (Light Side)**: `#2F4F2F` (forest green).\n  - **Bottom (Shadow Side)**: `#6B8E23` (olive-green).\n- **Veins**: Lighter green (`#32CD32`, lime-green) – 2px stroke along the midrib and lateral veins, with `opacity=\"0.8\"` to simulate raised texture.\n- **Brown Discoloration**: `#8B4513` (saddle brown) – irregular fill on the upper-left edge, `opacity=\"0.7\"`.\n- **Trichomes (Hairs)**: Tiny, 1–2px lines along the leaf margin and veins – `#2F4F2F` (forest green), `opacity=\"0.5\"`, 1px stroke.\n\n### Buds & Stems\n- **Buds**: `#6B8E23` (olive-green) – oval fill with `opacity=\"0.9\"`.\n- **Trichomes (Buds)**: 3–5px lines extending from the bud edges – `#2F4F2F` (forest green), `opacity=\"0.7\"`, 1px stroke.\n- **Stems**: `#6B8E23` (olive-green) – 10–15px wide, rectangular fill with `opacity=\"0.8\"`.\n\n### Background\n- **Blurred Foliage**: Muted green gradients to create depth:\n  - **Light Areas (Sunlight)**: `#8FBC8F` (sea green), `opacity=\"0.6\"`.\n  - **Dark Areas (Shadows)**: `#2E8B57` (dark sea green), `opacity=\"0.7\"`.\n- **Blur Filter**: Apply `feGaussianBlur` with `stdDeviation=\"5\"` to all background elements to simulate out-of-focus bokeh.\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe composition uses **depth of field** (sharp foreground, blurred background) to emphasize the tomato and hand. Below is the **z-order** (from front to back) and precise positioning:\n\n### Foreground (Sharpest)\n1. **Hand**: Occupies the **lower third** of the image, supporting the tomato.\n   - **Thumb**: Left side of the tomato (x: 100px, y: 400px) – overlaps the leaf’s right edge.\n   - **Index Finger**: Under the tomato’s left half (x: 200px, y: 500px).\n   - **Middle Finger**: Under the tomato’s right half (x: 350px, y: 550px).\n   - **Pinky**: Peeks from the bottom (x: 500px, y: 650px) – partially obscured by the middle finger.\n2. **Tomato**: Centered slightly to the **right of the image** (x: 600px, y: 300px) – rests on the hand’s index and middle fingers.\n   - **Rot Spot**: Upper half of the tomato (x: 650px, y: 250px) – aligned with the stem.\n3. **Leaf**: Left of the tomato (x: 150px, y: 200px) – overlaps the hand’s thumb.\n4. **Buds**: Above the tomato (x: 500px, y: 100px) – attached to the tomato’s stem.\n\n### Background (Blurred)\n- **Foliage**: Fill the entire background (x: 0px–1000px, y: 0px–750px) – no distinct shapes, just muted green gradients with blur.\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe image has a **realistic, documentary style** with a focus on natural detail and depth. Key artistic choices include:\n\n### Depth of Field\n- **Foreground**: Sharp edges and high contrast (tomato, hand, leaf).\n- **Background**: Blurred, low-contrast greenery – uses `feGaussianBlur` to separate layers.\n\n### Lighting\n- **Light Source**: Upper-left (simulated sunlight).\n  - **Tomato**: Highlight on the upper-right (brightest part of the gradient).\n  - **Hand**: Highlights on knuckles and finger tips; shadows between fingers and under the tomato.\n  - **Leaf**: Highlights on the veins (light side) and shadows on the bottom edge.\n\n### Texture Simulation\n- **Tomato**: Glossy skin via a radial gradient and small white highlight.\n- **Leaf**: Fuzzy texture via trichomes (tiny hairs) and a matte gradient.\n- **Rot Spot**: Rough, decaying texture via irregular edges, varying opacity, and a凹陷 core.\n- **Hand**: Skin texture via palm lines and subtle gradients for volume.\n\n\n## 5. Critical Details for SVG Reproduction\nTo ensure accuracy, include these **non-negotiable details** in the SVG:\n\n### Tomato\n- **Asymmetry**: Slightly flattened top/bottom, right-side bulge.\n- **Rot Spot Edges**: Irregular, jagged path (use 10–15 control points for naturalness).\n- **Stem Attachment**: Small stem (10px × 20px) at the top, connected to two buds.\n\n### Hand\n- **Finger Proportions**: Index finger > middle finger > pinky (natural adult hand proportions).\n- **Palm Lines**: Three main curved lines (central, lateral, pinky) – follow the shape of the palm.\n- **Shadow Under Tomato**: Dark green (`#2F4F2F`, `opacity=\"0.2\"`) – irregular fill under the tomato to simulate contact shadow.\n\n### Leaf\n- **Serrations**: Irregular triangular teeth (10–15 per leaf) – no two serrations should be identical.\n- **Curl**: Slight curl on the right edge – use a curved path for the leaf margin.\n\n### Buds & Stems\n- **Trichomes**: Randomly placed 1–5px lines – avoid uniformity to look natural.\n- **Stem Connection**: Buds attached to the tomato’s stem; leaf attached to a separate stem (blurred in the background).\n\n### SVG Technical Requirements\n- **Gradients**: Define all gradients (radial/linear) in the `<defs>` section.\n- **Filters**: Use `<filter id=\"blur\">` with `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"5\">` for the background.\n- **Paths**: Use `<path>` for all complex shapes (tomato, hand, leaf) – avoid `<rect>` or `<circle>` for organic forms.\n- **Opacity**: Apply `opacity` to trichomes, shadows, and background elements to simulate transparency.\n- **Z-Order**: Use `<g>` (groups) to layer elements: `<g id=\"background\">`, `<g id=\"leaf\">`, `<g id=\"hand\">`, `<g id=\"tomato\">`.\n\n\n## Summary of SVG Layers (Top-to-Bottom)\n| Layer ID         | Elements                                  | Key Properties                                  |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| `tomato`          | Tomato, rot spot, stem, buds              | Radial gradients, sharp edges, gloss highlight  |\n| `hand`            | Hand, fingers, palm lines                 | Linear gradients, shadow under tomato           |\n| `leaf`            | Leaf, veins, trichomes, brown discoloration | Linear gradients, serrated edges, 1px hair strokes |\n| `background`      | Blurred foliage                           | Gaussian blur, muted green gradients            |\n\n\nBy following this description, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s **visual hierarchy**, **textures**, and **natural details**—critical for a realistic and faithful reproduction.",
  "v1_192": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here’s a detailed breakdown of its components, focusing on geometry, texture, color, and composition:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **macro close-up** of a tree branch and a dried fruit, with a blurred natural background. Key elements include:  \n- **Primary Branch**: A thick, diagonal tree branch dominating the right half of the image. It has an irregular cylindrical shape with subtle width variations (wider in the middle, narrower at the top/bottom) and surface imperfections (buds, lichen, cracks).  \n- **Smaller Branches/Buds**: Thin, angular secondary branches (1–2 mm diameter) extending left from the primary branch, with tiny conical buds (1–2 mm tall) at their tips.  \n- **Dried Fruit**: A shriveled, lumpy oval (≈2.5 cm tall × 1.8 cm wide) hanging from a thin stem (1 mm diameter × 1 cm long) attached to the primary branch. The fruit has a **central hole** (≈5 mm diameter) at its top (where the stem was once attached) and a rough, textured surface.  \n- **Background**: A soft, gradient blur with no distinct objects, transitioning from light blue (top) to muted gray-brown (bottom).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Primary Branch**  \n- **Base Color**: Warm brown (#8B5A2B) with a grayish tint (#A08060) for weathering.  \n- **Lichen**: Irregular yellow patches (#FFD700) with white edges (#F0E68C), varying in size (3–5 mm) and shape (organic, jagged).  \n- **Texture**: Rough bark with subtle cracks, small bumps (1–2 mm), and scattered white dust spots (#E0E0E0).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft highlights (#C0A080) on the top edge (from left-top light), with gentle shadows (#654321) on the bottom.  \n\n#### **Smaller Branches/Buds**  \n- **Branches**: Dark brown (#654321), smoother than the primary branch.  \n- **Buds**: Conical, dark brown (#503015) with a matte finish.  \n\n#### **Dried Fruit**  \n- **Base Color**: Rusty red-brown (#8B3A3A) with tan (#D2B48C) and gray (#808080) undertones for dryness.  \n- **Hole**: Deep black (#000000) inside, with a slightly ragged edge.  \n- **Texture**: Highly wrinkled (use a **noise pattern** or **displacement map** for fuzziness) and dusty, with a matte finish. The surface has uneven lumps (1–3 mm) and crevices.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Gradient**: Linear gradient from light sky blue (#B0E0E6) at the top to muted gray-brown (#A09080) at the bottom.  \n- **Blur**: Gaussian blur (≈5–10 pixels) to mimic bokeh, with no texture—smooth and diffused.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Primary Branch**: Diagonally spans 80% of the image height (from top edge to bottom edge) and 60% of the width (from right edge to mid-left). It curves slightly toward the center, creating a natural flow.  \n- **Dried Fruit**: Hangs from the primary branch via a 1 cm stem, positioned **1/3 of the way from the bottom of the primary branch** (center-left of the image). The fruit’s center aligns with the primary branch’s left edge, making it the focal point.  \n- **Smaller Branches**: Extend left from the primary branch at 45°–60° angles, spaced 2–3 cm apart. The longest branch is ≈2 cm long.  \n- **Background**: Occupies the entire image, with the primary branch and fruit in the **foreground** (sharp focus) and the background in **midground/background** (blurred).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Genre**: Macro photography (realistic, natural).  \n- **Focus**: Shallow depth of field—foreground (branch, fruit) is sharp; background is blurred (bokeh).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, cool-white light from the **left-top**, creating gentle highlights on the primary branch’s top edge and the fruit’s upper half. Shadows are subtle and warm (#402010).  \n- **Mood**: Quiet, autumnal, with a focus on decay (dried fruit) and natural texture.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**  \n#### **Primary Branch**  \n- **Shape**: A closed path with a curved, irregular outline (wider in the middle, narrower at the top/bottom). Use a **cylinder** primitive with a **noise filter** for bark texture.  \n- **Lichen**: Overlay 3–5 irregular polygons (jagged edges) filled with #FFD700, with a 1 mm white (#F0E68C) border. Position them randomly on the branch (more concentrated on the right half).  \n- **Bumps/Dust**: Scatter 10–15 small circles (1–2 mm) filled with #E0E0E0 across the branch.  \n\n#### **Dried Fruit**  \n- **Shape**: A closed, irregular oval with a wavy outline (use the **pen tool** to draw 8–10 convex/concave curves for lumpiness).  \n- **Hole**: A 5 mm circle cut out of the top center, filled with #000000 (add a subtle gradient for depth).  \n- **Texture**: Apply a **simplex noise filter** (scale: 0.5) to the fruit’s fill for a dusty, wrinkled appearance. Add 3–4 dark brown (#503015) lines (1 mm wide) for deep crevices.  \n- **Stem**: A 1 cm line (1 mm width) from the fruit’s top to the primary branch, colored #654321.  \n\n#### **Smaller Branches/Buds**  \n- **Branches**: Draw 2–3 straight lines (1 mm width) from the primary branch, angled left at 45°–60°.  \n- **Buds**: Attach a 1–2 mm conical shape (triangle with rounded tip) to each branch tip, filled with #503015.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Gradient**: Linear gradient from #B0E0E6 (top) to #A09080 (bottom), spanning the entire image.  \n- **Blur**: Apply a **Gaussian blur filter** (stdDeviation: 5) to the background layer to mimic bokeh.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout**  \n- **Primary Branch**: Width = 15–20% of image width (varies along its length); Height = 80% of image height.  \n- **Dried Fruit**: Size = 1/5 of primary branch height; Position = 30% from the bottom of the primary branch, 10% from the left edge of the image.  \n- **Smaller Branches**: Length = 1–2 cm; Spacing = 2–3 cm apart along the primary branch.  \n\n\n### **7. Key SVG Considerations**  \n- **Layers**: Organize into 3 layers: **Foreground** (branch, fruit, buds), **Midground** (smaller branches), **Background** (gradient blur).  \n- **Filters**: Use `feNoise` for bark/fruit texture, `feGaussianBlur` for the background, and `feSpecularLighting` for subtle highlights on the branch.  \n- **Clipping**: Clip the primary branch to the image bounds to avoid overflow.  \n- **Accessibility**: Add `alt` text describing the scene (e.g., \"Close-up of a dried fruit hanging from a tree branch with lichen, soft background blur\").  \n\nThis detailed breakdown ensures accurate replication of the image’s natural texture, lighting, and composition in SVG. Adjust filter parameters (e.g., noise scale, blur strength) to match the original’s subtlety.",
  "v1_193": "To create an accurate SVG recreation of this image, we’ll break down the composition into **geometric shapes**, **color palettes**, **spatial hierarchy**, and **textural details**—focusing on the natural organic structure of cabbages, soil, and wilted foliage. Below is a comprehensive, technical description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image centers on a **mature cabbage plant** in the foreground, surrounded by smaller, less detailed cabbages in the background. The ground plane (soil) and wilted leaves dominate the lower third. Key elements include:\n\n### Foreground Cabbage (Focal Point)\nThe primary subject is a tight, spiral-shaped cabbage head with **layered, ruffled leaves**. It consists of two main parts:  \n- **Central Spiral**: 5–6 small, pointed leaves tightly coiled in a clockwise direction. Each leaf tapers to a tip and overlaps the one beneath it.  \n- **Outer Leaves**: 8–10 larger, fan-shaped leaves radiating from the central spiral. These leaves have **deeply wavy/ruffled edges** (1–2 cm amplitude) and extend 2–3 cm beyond the spiral’s diameter. Each outer leaf has a distinct central vein and lateral branching veins.  \n\n### Background Cabbages\n3–4 less detailed cabbage clumps in the upper left, upper right, and center background. Each clump is a loose cluster of 4–6 simple, oval leaves with muted green tones (to create depth).  \n\n### Wilted Leaves\n6–8 flat, discolored leaves on the ground, scattered around the foreground cabbage’s base. These leaves have:  \n- Irregular, torn edges.  \n- 2–3 small holes (1–3 mm diameter) along the margins or center.  \n- A curled or folded appearance (some leaves are partially rolled).  \n\n### Soil\nAn irregular, textured ground plane covering the lower 30% of the image. The soil has a rough, granular surface with small clumps and faint cracks.\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n### Color Palette\n| Element               | Base Color           | Accent/Shadow Color   | Highlight Color       |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Foreground Cabbage** |                      |                       |                       |\n| Central Spiral Leaves  | #3CB371 (Medium Sea Green) | #2E8B57 (Sea Green)   | #66CDAA (Medium Aquamarine) |\n| Outer Leaves (Surface) | #3CB371              | #2E8B57 (veins)       | #66CDAA (gloss)       |\n| Outer Leaves (Veins)   | #1E5939 (Dark Sea Green) | —                     | —                     |\n| **Background Cabbages** | #6B8E23 (Olive Drab) | #556B2F (Dark Olive)  | #8FBC8F (Dark Sea Green) |\n| **Wilted Leaves**      |                      |                       |                       |\n| Healthy Portions       | #F0E68C (Khaki)      | #DAA520 (Goldenrod)   | #FFF8DC (Cornsilk)    |\n| Dry/Dead Portions      | #DAA520              | #8B4513 (Saddle Brown) | —                     |\n| Holes (Edges)          | #8B4513              | —                     | —                     |\n| **Soil**               | #8B4513 (Saddle Brown) | #A0522D (Sienna)      | #D2691E (Chocolate)   |\n\n### Textures\n- **Healthy Cabbage Leaves**: Slight gloss (simulated with a linear gradient from light green at the top to dark green at the bottom). Veins are **raised** (represented by darker, 1–2 px wide paths).  \n- **Wilted Leaves**: Matte, dry texture (solid fill with a subtle gradient from yellow to brown at the edges). Holes have a rough, brown border.  \n- **Soil**: Granular texture (created with a pattern of 1–2 mm diameter circles/rectangles in varying brown shades, 20–30% opacity).  \n- **Background Cabbages**: Flat, muted colors (no gloss) to emphasize depth.\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n### Layout Hierarchy (Bottom to Top)\n1. **Soil** (bottom layer)  \n2. **Wilted Leaves** (on top of soil)  \n3. **Background Cabbages** (behind wilted leaves)  \n4. **Foreground Cabbage** (top layer, overlapping all other elements)  \n\n### Proportions (Relative to Image Dimensions)\nAssume the image is 1000px wide × 800px tall (adjustable for SVG scalability):  \n- **Foreground Cabbage**:  \n  - Total diameter: 800px (80% of image width).  \n  - Central spiral diameter: 250px (31% of total diameter).  \n  - Outer leaf length: 400px (50% of image height).  \n- **Background Cabbages**:  \n  - Each clump is 200–300px wide (20–30% of image width).  \n  - Positioned 100–200px from the top edge.  \n- **Wilted Leaves**:  \n  - Length: 100–200px (12–25% of image height).  \n  - Width: 50–100px (5–10% of image width).  \n  - Scattered 50–150px from the bottom edge.  \n- **Soil**:  \n  - Height: 240px (30% of image height).  \n  - Width: 1000px (full image width).  \n\n### Positioning\n- **Foreground Cabbage**: Centered horizontally (x=500px) and vertically aligned to the lower third (y=500px). Its base touches the top of the soil layer.  \n- **Background Cabbages**:  \n  - Upper left: (x=150px, y=100px).  \n  - Upper right: (x=850px, y=150px).  \n  - Center background: (x=500px, y=200px).  \n- **Wilted Leaves**:  \n  - Lower left: (x=100px, y=600px).  \n  - Lower right: (x=900px, y=650px).  \n  - Between foreground and background: (x=400px, y=550px); (x=600px, y=500px).  \n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe image has a **realistic yet simplified style** optimized for SVG:  \n- **Organic Shapes**: All leaves (foreground/background/wilted) use irregular, hand-drawn paths to mimic natural growth. No perfect circles or straight lines.  \n- **Depth via Layering**: Foreground elements (cabbage, wilted leaves) are in front of background cabbages, which are in front of soil.  \n- **Gradient Fills**: Used to simulate light and shadow:  \n  - **Healthy Leaves**: Linear gradient from light green (#66CDAA) at the top (light source) to dark green (#2E8B57) at the bottom.  \n  - **Wilted Leaves**: Linear gradient from yellow (#F0E68C) at the center to brown (#DAA520) at the edges (drying effect).  \n- **Vein Details**: Foreground leaves have 1–2 px wide central veins (dark green) with lateral veins branching at 45–60° angles. Background cabbages omit lateral veins for simplicity.  \n- **Texture Simplification**: Soil uses a subtle pattern (small brown circles) instead of photorealistic texture to keep the SVG lightweight.\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **No text or symbols** are present.  \n- **Holes in Wilted Leaves**: 2–3 per leaf, created by subtracting small (1–3 mm) irregular shapes (circles/ovals) from the leaf path. The hole edges are filled with #8B4513 (Saddle Brown) to simulate dry, ragged edges.  \n- **Leaf Damage**: Some outer cabbage leaves have tiny (1–2 mm) brown spots (#8B4513) with 30–50% opacity, scattered along the margins.  \n- **Soil Clumps**: 5–10 small (5–10 mm) irregular shapes (#A0522D) scattered across the soil to add texture.  \n\n\n## SVG Technical Notes for Recreation\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these guidelines:  \n- **Layers**: Group elements by type (e.g., `foreground-cabbage`, `background-cabbages`, `wilted-leaves`, `soil`).  \n- **Paths**: Use the Pen Tool to draw irregular leaf edges and veins. Avoid using auto-trace (it can over-simplify natural shapes).  \n- **Gradients**: Apply linear gradients to leaves with the light source at the top (e.g., `gradientTransform=\"rotate(90)\"` for vertical gradients).  \n- **Patterns**: Create a soil texture pattern (small brown circles) and apply it to the soil path using `fill=\"url(#soil-pattern)\"`.  \n- **Opacity**: Use 80–90% opacity for background cabbages to make them recede. Wilted leaves can have 90% opacity to blend with the soil.  \n- **Overlap**: For the foreground cabbage’s outer leaves, arrange them in a **stack** where each leaf is behind the one in front (e.g., `leaf-1` → `leaf-2` → `leaf-3` from bottom to top).  \n\nExample SVG structure:\n```xml\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 1000 800\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Soil Layer (Bottom) -->\n  <defs>\n    <pattern id=\"soil-pattern\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n      <circle cx=\"5\" cy=\"5\" r=\"2\" fill=\"#A0522D\"/>\n      <circle cx=\"15\" cy=\"15\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#D2691E\"/>\n    </pattern>\n  </defs>\n  <path id=\"soil\" d=\"M0 600 Q100 650 200 620 Q400 600 500 650 Q700 620 800 650 Q900 600 1000 600 V800 H0 Z\" fill=\"url(#soil-pattern)\"/>\n\n  <!-- Wilted Leaves (Middle Layer) -->\n  <g id=\"wilted-leaves\">\n    <path id=\"wilted-leaf-1\" d=\"M100 600 Q150 650 200 620 Q250 600 300 650 Q350 620 400 600\" fill=\"#F0E68C\" stroke=\"#DAA520\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n      <set attributeName=\"opacity\" to=\"0.9\"/>\n    </path>\n    <!-- Add holes using <use> or <path> with fill=\"none\" and stroke=\"#8B4513\" -->\n    <circle cx=\"180\" cy=\"630\" r=\"2\" fill=\"#8B4513\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"250\" cy=\"610\" r=\"1.5\" fill=\"#8B4513\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Background Cabbages (Middle Layer) -->\n  <g id=\"background-cabbages\" opacity=\"0.8\">\n    <path id=\"bg-cabbage-1\" d=\"M100 100 Q150 150 200 100 Q250 50 300 100\" fill=\"#6B8E23\"/>\n    <!-- Add simple veins with <line> or <path> -->\n    <line x1=\"150\" y1=\"100\" x2=\"200\" y2=\"150\" stroke=\"#556B2F\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Foreground Cabbage (Top Layer) -->\n  <g id=\"foreground-cabbage\">\n    <!-- Central Spiral (Top of Stack) -->\n    <path id=\"spiral-leaf-1\" d=\"M500 300 Q520 320 540 300 Q560 280 580 300\" fill=\"#3CB371\" stroke=\"#2E8B57\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n    <!-- Outer Leaves (Below Spiral) -->\n    <path id=\"outer-leaf-1\" d=\"M400 400 Q450 500 500 450 Q550 400 600 450\" fill=\"url(#leaf-gradient)\" stroke=\"#2E8B57\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n      <defs>\n        <linearGradient id=\"leaf-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n          <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#66CDAA\"/>\n          <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#2E8B57\"/>\n        </linearGradient>\n      </defs>\n    </path>\n    <!-- Add veins with <path> -->\n    <path id=\"vein-1\" d=\"M500 450 Q520 480 540 460 Q560 440 580 450\" stroke=\"#1E5939\" stroke-width=\"1.5\"/>\n  </g>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\nThis description provides all the necessary details to recreate the image as a realistic, scalable SVG—focusing on natural shapes, color accuracy, and spatial hierarchy. Adjust proportions or colors as needed for your specific use case.",
  "v1_194": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, a detailed breakdown of **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, textures, and style** is essential. Below is a structured, comprehensive description tailored for precision in vector design:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **close-up of an infected corn (maize) ear** attached to a vertical stalk, with a shallow depth of field (DOF) that blurs background foliage. The focal point is the **corn smut (Ustilago maydis) galls**—irregular, swollen masses replacing normal corn kernels. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Primary Subject: Infected Corn Ear**\n- **Galls**: 8–10 irregular, lobed, rounded masses clustered at the center. Shapes vary from oval (small, pea-sized) to oblong/lobed (large, walnut-sized). Some galls are **cracked open** (e.g., center-right), revealing a softer, creamy interior.  \n- **Husk Leaves**: 5–6 elongated, lance-shaped leaves wrapping around the base of the galls. They extend outward and upward, with pointed tips and irregular, frayed edges.  \n- **Stalk**: A vertical, slightly tapered cylinder supporting the ear. It runs through the center of the image, with subtle ridges and leaf scars.\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Frame Leaves**: 2–3 large, broad lanceolate leaves (left, right, and behind the stalk) with prominent parallel veins. These are out of focus (shallow DOF) and serve to frame the main subject.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are muted and natural, with high contrast between the pale galls and dark green foliage. Textures emphasize the **dried, fungal-infected state** of the ear and the waxy, veined quality of healthy leaves.\n\n| Element               | Colors (Hex Codes)                                                                 | Textures & Visual Properties                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Galls**             | - Primary: Pale grayish-white (`#E8E4E0`) with subtle yellow undertones. <br>- Secondary: Dark gray (`#808080`) for cracked/scaly patches. <br>- Interior (cracked galls): Creamy off-white (`#F5F0E6`). | Rough, powdery surface (simulate with small dot patterns). Cracked areas have jagged edges and matte interiors. Small dark spots (spores) scattered on surfaces. |\n| **Husk Leaves**       | - Blade: Medium forest green (`#2E8B57`) with lighter green veins (`#3CB371`). <br>- Edges: Dried tan/brown (`#A0522D`) with frayed texture. | Waxy, slightly glossy surface. Veins are raised (use stroke lines). Edges are irregular and curled. |\n| **Stalk**             | - Base: Lime green (`#32CD32`) with subtle brown streaks (`#8B4513`) at leaf attachments. <br>- Top: Paler lime green (`#90EE90`) tapering upward. | Smooth but ridged (use subtle linear gradients). Small, oval leaf scars (brown) spaced evenly. |\n| **Background Leaves** | - Blade: Dark green (`#006400`) with lighter green veins (`#228B22`). <br>- Shadows: Muted dark green (`#004000`). | Blurred (simulate with low opacity or Gaussian blur filter). Veins are less defined than husk leaves. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships & Positioning**\nThe image uses a **central composition** with the stalk as the vertical axis. Shallow DOF isolates the galls, while background leaves frame the subject. Below is a **coordinate system** (assuming a 1000px × 1000px canvas) to guide layout:\n\n| Element               | Position (x, y) & Dimensions                                 | Layering (Front → Back)                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Stalk**             | - Runs vertically through center: `x=500px` (center), `y=0px` (top) to `y=1000px` (bottom). <br>- Width: 80px (bottom) → 60px (top) (taper). | Behind galls and husks; in front of background leaves.                                  |\n| **Infected Ear**      | - Centered on stalk: `x=350–650px`, `y=350–650px` (occupies 30% of canvas width). <br>- Galls: Clustered tightly; largest gall (`100px × 80px`) at center. | Galls are the **foreground focal point**; husks wrap around their base (some husks in front of galls, others behind). |\n| **Husk Leaves**       | - Left husk: `x=300px` (base) → `x=150px` (tip), `y=500px` (base) → `y=300px` (tip). <br>- Right husk: `x=700px` (base) → `x=850px` (tip), `y=500px` (base) → `y=300px` (tip). <br>- Top husk: `x=500px` (base) → `x=550px` (tip), `y=400px` (base) → `y=250px` (tip). | Some husks overlap galls (front); others are behind galls. Edges fray outward.          |\n| **Background Leaves** | - Left leaf: `x=0px` → `x=200px`, `y=100px` → `y=900px` (curves inward). <br>- Right leaf: `x=800px` → `x=1000px`, `y=100px` → `y=900px` (curves inward). | Blurred and placed **behind the stalk and ear**; frame the left/right edges.              |\n\n\n### **4. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic close-up photograph** with two key artistic traits:  \n- **Shallow Depth of Field**: The galls and husks are in sharp focus, while background leaves are blurred (use SVG filters like `feGaussianBlur` with a `stdDeviation` of 2–3 for background elements).  \n- **Natural Lighting**: Soft, diffused daylight from the **top-left** creates subtle highlights on the left edges of galls/husks and soft shadows on the right. Highlights emphasize texture (e.g., gall surfaces, husk veins).  \n\n**Key Style Notes for SVG**:  \n- Use **gradients** to simulate lighting (e.g., lighter left edges on galls/husks, darker right edges).  \n- Use **stroke lines** for veins (husk leaves: 1px, background leaves: 0.5px).  \n- Use **pattern fills** for gall texture (e.g., small `#808080` dots spaced 2px apart).\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for Accuracy**\nThese details are critical for capturing the image’s realism:  \n- **Galls**:  \n  - 1–2 galls are cracked open (center-right gall reveals a creamy interior with a 20px × 15px opening).  \n  - Small dark spots (`#000000`, 1–2px diameter) are scattered on gall surfaces (simulate spores).  \n- **Husk Leaves**:  \n  - Edges are frayed (use irregular stroke paths or `feTurbulence` filter for a \"fuzzy\" look).  \n  - 2–3 leaves have dried brown tips (`#A0522D`) extending 10–15px from the tip.  \n- **Stalk**:  \n  - 3–4 oval leaf scars (`#8B4513`, 10px × 5px) spaced evenly along the stalk.  \n- **Background**:  \n  - Leaves are blurred (reduce opacity to 70% and apply a mild Gaussian blur).  \n  - Veins are less defined than husk leaves (use lighter green `#228B22` with 0.5px stroke).\n\n\n### **6. Proportions & Layout Guidelines**\nFor a 1000px × 1000px SVG canvas:  \n- **Stalk**: Occupies 80% of the canvas height (from `y=100px` to `y=900px`). Width tapers from 80px (bottom) to 60px (top).  \n- **Infected Ear**: Centered on the stalk, occupying 30% of the canvas width (`x=350–650px`) and 20% of the height (`y=400–600px`).  \n- **Galls**: The largest gall (center) is 100px wide × 80px tall; smaller galls are 30–60px in diameter.  \n- **Husk Leaves**: Extend 150–200px from the stalk (e.g., left husk reaches `x=150px`).  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Workflow**\n1. **Build the Stalk**: Draw a vertical rectangle with a taper, add leaf scars, and apply a lime green gradient.  \n2. **Add Husk Leaves**: Draw lance-shaped paths with frayed edges, add veins, and apply forest green with brown edges.  \n3. **Create Galls**: Draw irregular rounded shapes, add cracks (using clipping paths), apply pale gray with dark spots, and highlight cracked interiors.  \n4. **Background Leaves**: Draw broad lance shapes, apply dark green with light veins, and blur using `feGaussianBlur`.  \n5. **Lighting**: Add gradients to galls/husks (lighter left, darker right) to simulate top-left lighting.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s realism, texture, and composition.",
  "v1_195": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this close-up macro image, the following detailed breakdown of **main objects, colors, textures, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** is essential. The image focuses on a textured gall (abnormal plant growth) on a branch, with a shallow depth of field that blurs background elements (leaves, berries, flowers).\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is anchored by a **focal gall** on a wooden branch, surrounded by smaller, blurred background elements. Key objects include:\n\n| Object               | Shape/Description                                                                 |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Gall**             | Irregular, convex mass with multiple rounded protrusions and indentations (like a lumpy tumor). Asymmetric, with a base attached to the branch. Contains 10–15 small, circular/oval exit holes (1–3mm diameter) distributed randomly across its surface. |\n| **Branch**           | Cylindrical stem tapering from a thicker base (bottom-right) to a thinner tip (upper-left). Has 2–3 small, sharp thorns (1–2cm long) on the left/right sides. |\n| **Leaves**           | Compound, serrated leaves with 3–5 lobes. One prominent leaf (bottom-left) is flipped to show its lighter underside; others are in the background (top, left, right). |\n| **Red Berry Clusters** | 4–5 clusters of 3–5 small, spherical berries (unripe blackberries). Scattered in the left, right, and bottom thirds of the image. |\n| **White Flowers**    | Tiny, 5-petaled flowers (1–2cm diameter) with pale petals. Clustered near red berries. |\n| **Black Berries**    | 1 small cluster of 4–5 ripe blackberries (bottom-center). Smaller than red berries. |\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is earthy and vibrant, with high contrast between the dark gall/branch and bright background elements. Textures range from rough (gall/branch) to glossy (berries) to veined (leaves).\n\n#### **Focal Gall (Foreground)**\n- **Base Color**: Dominated by **dark browns** (#4E3A31) with undertones of gray (#8B7A72) and purple (#5A3E45).  \n- **Texture**: Matte with a \"dusty\" appearance, achieved via:  \n  - **Gradient**: Radial gradients (dark center → lighter edges) on each protrusion to mimic depth.  \n  - **Pattern**: Subtle noise (10–15% opacity) in light gray (#A99F9A) to replicate surface dust.  \n  - **Holes**: Small black (#2D2D2D) circles/ovals (1–3mm) with slightly ragged edges (to simulate insect exit holes).  \n- **Shape**: Complex, asymmetric path with 8–10 rounded protrusions and 5–7 indentations. The base is fused to the branch.\n\n#### **Branch (Foreground)**\n- **Color**: Reddish-brown (#8B572A) with a greenish tinge (#A67C52) on younger growth.  \n- **Texture**: Woody, with:  \n  - **Gradient**: Linear gradient along the stem (darker center → lighter edges) to mimic cylindrical volume.  \n  - **Pattern**: Subtle horizontal lines (#704214) for grain texture (1–2px thick, 10–15px spacing).  \n- **Shape**: Tapering path (50px thick at the base, 30px thick at the gall attachment point) with a slight curve (from bottom-right to upper-left).  \n- **Thorns**: Small, pointed paths (1–2cm long) with a brown (#8B572A) fill, attached to the branch’s left/right sides.\n\n#### **Leaves (Background)**\n- **Shape**: Compound with 3–5 lobes and serrated edges. One leaf (bottom-left) is flipped to show its lighter underside.  \n- **Color**: Bright green (#2E8B57) for upper surfaces, pale green (#66CDAA) for undersides. Veins are darker green (#1E5936).  \n- **Texture**: Veined (prominent midrib and secondary veins) with a slightly fuzzy appearance (simulated via subtle noise).  \n- **Depth**: Background leaves are **blurred** (Gaussian blur: 2–3px) to reduce detail.\n\n#### **Red Berries (Background)**\n- **Shape**: Clusters of 3–5 spherical berries (15px diameter each), tightly grouped.  \n- **Color**: Vivid red (#FF0000) with a glossy white (#FFFFFF) highlight (upper-right quadrant of each berry).  \n- **Texture**: Smooth, reflective surface (simulated via radial gradient: dark red center → light red edge + white highlight).  \n- **Depth**: Most clusters are blurred (1–2px Gaussian blur); one cluster (left-middle) is slightly sharper.\n\n#### **White Flowers (Background)**\n- **Shape**: 5-petaled, with curved, teardrop-shaped petals. Clustered near red berries.  \n- **Color**: Pale white (#F0F8FF) with a tiny yellow (#FFFFE0) center (optional, as it’s faint in the image).  \n- **Texture**: Delicate, papery petals (simulated via soft gradients).  \n- **Depth**: Blurred (1–2px Gaussian blur) to match background foliage.\n\n#### **Black Berries (Background)**\n- **Shape**: Cluster of 4–5 spherical berries (10px diameter each), smaller than red berries.  \n- **Color**: Deep black (#000000) with a gray (#333333) highlight (upper-right).  \n- **Texture**: Shiny, like ripe blackberries (radial gradient: black center → dark gray edge + gray highlight).  \n- **Position**: Bottom-center, between two red berry clusters.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout follows a **diagonal flow** (branch from bottom-right to upper-left) with the gall as the visual anchor. Use **layers** (foreground → background) to replicate depth:\n\n| Layer       | Elements                                  | Position/Alignment                                                                 |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Foreground** | Gall, Branch                              | - Gall: Upper center-left (covers ~30% of the image width).<br>- Branch: Runs from bottom-right (thick base) to upper-left (thin tip), with the gall attached at its upper third.<br>- Thorns: Left side (near gall) and right side (mid-branch). |\n| **Midground**  | Red Berries (1 cluster), Black Berries    | - Red berries: Left-middle (slightly overlapping the branch).<br>- Black berries: Bottom-center (between two red clusters). |\n| **Background** | Leaves, Red Berries (3 clusters), Flowers | - Leaves: Top, left, and right (overlapping the branch and gall).<br>- Red berries: Left (2 clusters), right (1 cluster), bottom (1 cluster).<br>- Flowers: Near red berries (left, right, bottom). |\n\n#### **Key Proportions**\n- Gall: ~2–3x wider than the branch (300px wide × 250px tall in a 1000px × 800px canvas).  \n- Branch: 50px thick at the base, tapering to 30px at the gall attachment.  \n- Red Berries: Clusters are ~1/4 the size of the gall (50px diameter); individual berries are 15px.  \n- Black Berries: Clusters are ~1/5 the size of the gall (40px diameter); individual berries are 10px.  \n- Leaves: 150–200px long × 100–150px wide (foreground leaf is larger than background leaves).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **macro close-up** with a **shallow depth of field**, so:  \n- **Foreground (gall, branch)**: Sharp, high-detail (e.g., gall texture, branch grain).  \n- **Background (leaves, berries, flowers)**: Blurred (Gaussian blur: 1–3px) and desaturated (lighter colors) to push them back.  \n- **Organic Texture**: The gall and branch have irregular, natural shapes—avoid perfect symmetry.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused natural light (no harsh shadows). Highlights on berries and the gall’s protrusions add dimensionality.\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details (Critical for SVG Accuracy)**\n#### **Gall**\n- **Holes**: 10–15 small circles/ovals (1–3mm) with a black (#2D2D2D) fill. Distribute randomly but avoid clustering.  \n- **Surface Texture**: Use a **radial gradient** for each protrusion (dark brown center → light gray edge) and a **noise pattern** (10% opacity, #A99F9A) for the \"dusty\" look.  \n- **Edges**: Slightly ragged (not perfectly smooth) to mimic natural growth.\n\n#### **Branch**\n- **Wood Grain**: Subtle horizontal lines (#704214) along the stem (1–2px thick, 10–15px spacing).  \n- **Taper**: Gradually reduce the stroke width from 50px (base) to 30px (gall attachment) using a **stroke-width gradient** or path editing.  \n- **Thorns**: Pointed paths (1–2cm long) with a brown (#8B572A) fill, attached to the branch’s left/right sides.\n\n#### **Leaves**\n- **Vein Details**: Draw 3–5 primary veins (darker green, #1E5936) from the midrib to the leaf edges. Use a **dashed line** or thin stroke for secondary veins.  \n- **Serrations**: Add 10–15 small \"teeth\" along the leaf edges (1–2px deep).  \n- **Underside Leaf**: The bottom-left leaf is flipped—use a pale green (#66CDAA) fill with lighter veins.\n\n#### **Berries**\n- **Highlights**: For red berries, add a small white (#FFFFFF) ellipse (5px × 3px) in the upper-right quadrant. For black berries, use a gray (#333333) ellipse.  \n- **Clustering**: Group berries tightly (1–2px spacing between them) to mimic natural clusters.\n\n#### **Flowers**\n- **Petals**: 5 curved paths (10px × 5px) with a pale white (#F0F8FF) fill. Arrange them in a star shape around a tiny yellow (#FFFFE0) circle (center).  \n- **Stems**: Thin green (#2E8B57) lines (1px) connecting flowers to the branch/leaves (optional, as they’re faint in the image).\n\n\n### **6. Color Palette (Hex Codes)**\nUse these exact hex codes to match the image’s tones:  \n| Element         | Hex Code(s)                                  |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Gall (base)     | #4E3A31 (dark brown), #8B7A72 (gray-brown)   |\n| Gall (patches)  | #A99F9A (pale gray)                          |\n| Gall holes      | #2D2D2D (black)                              |\n| Branch          | #8B572A (reddish-brown), #A67C52 (light brown) |\n| Leaves (upper)  | #2E8B57 (dark green)                         |\n| Leaves (underside) | #66CDAA (pale green)                     |\n| Leaf veins      | #1E5936 (dark green)                         |\n| Red berries     | #FF0000 (red), #FFFFFF (highlight)           |\n| Black berries   | #000000 (black), #333333 (highlight)         |\n| White flowers   | #F0F8FF (pale white), #FFFFE0 (center)       |\n\n\n### **6. SVG Technical Notes**\nTo replicate the image’s **depth of field** and **textures**, use these SVG features:  \n- **Blur**: Apply `filter: url(#gaussian-blur)` to background elements (leaves, berries, flowers). Adjust the blur radius (1–3px) based on distance from the foreground.  \n- **Gradients**: Use `<linearGradient>` for branch/leaf veins and `<radialGradient>` for gall protrusions, berries, and leaves.  \n- **Patterns**: Create a `<pattern>` with small gray dots (#A99F9A) for the gall’s \"dusty\" texture.  \n- **Clipping Paths**: Use a clipping path on the gall to fuse it seamlessly with the branch (avoid a \"floating\" appearance).  \n- **Groups**: Organize elements into groups (e.g., `<g id=\"gall\">`, `<g id=\"branch\">`) for easier editing.\n\n\n### **Summary of Critical SVG Requirements**\n| Feature               | SVG Implementation                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Gall**              | Complex path with protrusions/indentations, radial gradients, noise pattern, black holes. |\n| **Branch**            | Tapering path with wood grain lines, thorns, linear gradient.                     |\n| **Leaves**            | Serrated paths with veins, green gradients, Gaussian blur (background).          |\n| **Berries**           | Clustered circles with highlights, solid colors, Gaussian blur (background).     |\n| **Flowers**           | 5-petaled paths with pale white fill, Gaussian blur.                              |\n| **Depth of Field**    | Foreground (sharp) vs. background (blurred) layers.                               |\n| **Textures**          | Gradients (gall, branch, leaves), patterns (gall dust), highlights (berries).     |\n\nBy following this breakdown, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s organic textures, color palette, and spatial dynamics—capturing the macro detail of the gall while maintaining the soft, blurred background that defines the original photo.",
  "v1_196": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, below is a detailed, structured description of **main objects, colors, textures, spatial relationships, style, and geometric details**. The description prioritizes vector-friendly elements (shapes, gradients, patterns) and precise proportions to ensure fidelity to the original.\n\n\n## **1. Canvas & Background**\nThe image is set on a **rectangular canvas** (approx. 1000px wide × 800px tall) with a **rough wooden surface** as the base. The wood has:  \n- **Color**: A base of deep brown (#8B4513) with lighter, irregular streaks (#A0522D) and grayish cracks (#696969) to simulate grain and wear.  \n- **Texture**: Horizontal, curved \"grain\" lines (1–2px thick) spaced 5–10px apart, plus small, irregular lighter patches (ellipses/rectangles) to mimic weathering.  \n- **Layout**: Fills the entire canvas; all foreground elements (strawberries, leaves) are positioned in front of the wood.\n\n\n## **2. Main Objects: Strawberries**\nThere are **four strawberries** hanging from thin green stems, varying in ripeness. Below is a breakdown of each:\n\n### **a. Ripe Strawberry 1 (Top Left)**\n- **Shape**: Large, rounded oval (approx. 200px wide × 250px tall) with a slightly flattened base.  \n- **Color**: Bright red gradient (#FF2400 to #CC0000) for depth, with a glossy highlight (white, 50px × 20px) on the top-left to simulate shine.  \n- **Texture**:  \n  - **Seeds**: ~50 small yellow circles (#FFD700), 3–4px in diameter, evenly distributed but slightly irregular.

Ripe Strawberry 2 (Bottom Center)**\n- **Shape**: Smaller, more elongated oval (150px wide × 200px tall) with a pointed base.  \n- **Color**: Same red gradient as Strawberry 1 (#FF2400 to #CC0000) but with a darker base to suggest depth.  \n- **Texture**: Identical to Strawberry 1 (yellow seeds, glossy highlight).  \n- **Calyx**: Fresh green (#228B22) with 4–5 petals, smaller than Strawberry 1’s.  \n- **Stem**: Thin (2px) green line (#228B22) extending from the calyx to the top-center of the canvas (merges with Strawberry 1’s stem).  \n- **Position**: Bottom-center (center at `550px, 650px`), below the overripe strawberry.\n\n\n### **c. Overripe/Moldy Strawberry (Top Right)**\n- **Shape**: Similar in size to Strawberry 1 (180px wide × 220px tall) but slightly flattened at the top.  \n- **Color**: Dominant gray (#808080) with brown (#8B4513) and black (#000000) spots to mimic mold and decay.  \n- **Texture**:  \n  - **Mold**: Fuzzy, irregular pattern of small (2–5px) overlapping circles in shades of gray (#A9A9A9 to #696969) to create depth.  \n  - **Surface**: Wrinkled, with a matte finish (no highlight).  \n- **Calyx**: Dried, brown (#8B4513) petals curled inward (5–6 petals, 10–15px long).  \n- **Stem**: Thin (2px) brownish-green line (#6B8E23) extending from the calyx to the top-right of the canvas.  \n- **Position**: Top-right (center at `650px, 500px`), overlapping Strawberry 1 (left) and Strawberry 2 (below).\n\n\n### **d. Unripe Strawberry (Center)**\n- **Shape**: Tiny, rounded oval (50px wide × 70px tall) with a bumpy surface.  \n- **Color**: Bright lime green (#32CD32) with lighter green (#90EE90) highlights for texture.  \n- **Texture**: Small (1–2px) irregular bumps (ellipses) on the surface to mimic immaturity.  \n- **Calyx**: Small, fresh green (#228B22) with 3–4 petals (5–10px long).  \n- **Stem**: Very short (5px) green line (#228B22) connecting to Strawberry 1’s stem.  \n- **Position**: Center (center at `480px, 500px`), between Strawberry 1 and the overripe strawberry.\n\n\n## **3. Leaves**\nMultiple green leaves with serrated edges frame the strawberries. Key leaves include:\n\n### **a. Background Leaves (Top & Right)**\n- **Shape**: Large (200–300px wide) irregular polygons with serrated edges (10–15 \"teeth\" per edge).  \n- **Color**: Dark green (#006400) base with lighter green (#228B22) veins and a glossy gradient (light green highlight on the top-left).  \n- **Texture**:  \n  - **Veins**: Branching lines (2px thick) from the center to the edges, lighter than the base color.  \n  - **Water Droplets**: Small (5–10px) ellipses on veins, with a white (#FFFFFF) highlight and light blue (#ADD8E6) gradient to simulate shine.  \n- **Position**:  \n  - Top-left: Behind Strawberry 1 (center at `150px, 100px`).  \n  - Top-right: Behind the overripe strawberry (center at `850px, 400px`).\n\n\n### **b. Foreground Leaf (Bottom Left)**\n- **Shape**: Smaller (100px wide) irregular polygon with serrated edges.  \n- **Color**: Dark green (#006400) base with yellow (#FFFF00) spots (5–10px circles) to mimic disease or aging.  \n- **Texture**: Glossy gradient (light green highlight) and visible veins (lighter green).  \n- **Position**: Bottom-left (center at `100px, 750px`), in front of the wooden background.\n\n\n## **4. Spatial Relationships & Layering**\nElements are layered from **background to foreground** to create depth:  \n1. **Wooden background** (z=0)  \n2. **Background leaves** (z=1)  \n3. **Strawberries** (z=2: overripe > ripe 1 > ripe 2 > unripe)  \n4. **Stems** (z=3)  \n5. **Water droplets** (z=4)  \n6. **Highlights (strawberries, leaves, droplets)** (z=5)  \n\n### **Key Overlaps**:\n- Strawberry 1 (top-left) overlaps the overripe strawberry (right) and unripe strawberry (below).  \n- The overripe strawberry overlaps Strawberry 2 (bottom-center).  \n- Background leaves frame the strawberries but do not overlap the foreground leaf.\n\n\n## **5. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: Detailed textures (strawberry seeds, leaf veins, wood grain) and lighting (highlights, shadows) create a lifelike appearance.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft top-left light source, resulting in:  \n  - **Highlights**: White/light color accents on strawberries, leaves, and water droplets.  \n  - **Shadows**: Subtle darker tones (e.g., #CC0000 on ripe strawberries, #404040 on overripe) on the bottom-right of objects.  \n- **Color Palette**: Vibrant reds (strawberries), deep greens (leaves), and warm browns (wood) create a natural, inviting tone.\n\n\n## **6. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**\n### **Strawberries**:\n- **Seeds**: 50–70 small (#FFD700) circles per ripe strawberry, placed in a random but even pattern (avoid perfect grids).  \n- **Overripe Mold**: Use a **pattern fill** (SVG `<pattern>`) of small gray circles to simulate fuzziness.  \n- **Ripe Gloss**: Apply a **linear gradient** (from #CC0000 to #FF2400) with a white highlight (10px × 20px) on the top-left.  \n\n### **Leaves**:\n- **Serrated Edges**: Use the SVG `<polygon>` element with vertices at each \"tooth\" (e.g., `0,0 10,5 20,0 30,5 ...`).  \n- **Veins**: Draw branching `<line>` elements from the leaf’s base to the edges, with a lighter green stroke (#228B22).  \n\n### **Wooden Background**:\n- **Grain**: Use a **pattern fill** of horizontal, curved lines (#A0522D) spaced 5–10px apart.  \n- **Wear**: Add `<rect>` or `<ellipse>` elements in lighter brown (#A0522D) to mimic worn spots, and `<path>` elements for cracks.  \n\n### **Water Droplets**:\n- **Shine**: Draw an ellipse with a **radial gradient** (from #FFFFFF to #ADD8E6) and a small white `<circle>` for the highlight.  \n\n\n## **7. Proportions & Coordinates (Reference)**\nUse the following approximate coordinates (based on a 1000px × 800px canvas) to position elements:  \n| Element               | Center Coordinates (x, y) | Width (px) | Height (px) |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Ripe Strawberry 1     | (350, 300)                | 200        | 250         |\n| Ripe Strawberry 2     | (550, 650)                | 150        | 200         |\n| Overripe Strawberry   | (650, 500)                | 180        | 220         |\n| Unripe Strawberry     | (480, 500)                | 50         | 70          |\n| Large Background Leaf (Top-left) | (150, 100)          | 300        | 200         |\n| Foreground Leaf       | (100, 750)                | 100        | 80          |\n\n\n## **8. Final Notes for SVG**\n- **Gradients**: Use SVG `<linearGradient>` and `<radialGradient>` for glossy surfaces (strawberries, leaves) and shadows.  \n- **Patterns**: Use `<pattern>` for repeating textures (mold, wood grain) to keep the file size manageable.  \n- **Responsiveness**: Set the canvas to `width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"` for scalability.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s natural textures, lighting, and composition while maintaining vector flexibility.",
  "v1_197": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties with a focus on geometric precision, texture, and spatial relationships:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **close-up of a single, damaged leaf** in the foreground, with blurred green foliage in the background. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Main Leaf (Foreground)**\n- **Shape**: Ovate (egg-shaped) with a slightly elongated tip and a rounded base. The edges are **serrated** (tiny, irregular teeth), though the serrations are soft and not sharply defined. The leaf is tilted diagonally, with the base at the **bottom-left corner** and the tip extending toward the **top-right**.\n- **Size**: Dominates ~80% of the frame. Relative to the background, it is 3–4x larger than the nearest blurred leaf.\n- **Veins**: A thick, prominent **central vein** runs from the base to the tip, tapering slightly toward the top. **Lateral veins** branch off the central vein at ~45–60° angles, spaced evenly (~1–2 cm apart in real-world scale) and extending to the leaf edges. These lateral veins are thinner than the central vein and have minor sub-branches.\n\n#### **Lesions (Leaf Damage)**\n- **Quantity**: 12–15 distinct lesions scattered across the leaf, concentrated in the **upper half** but with a few in the lower half (e.g., bottom-left and center).\n- **Shape**: Irregular, roughly polygonal (4–6 sides) with jagged edges. Some lesions merge partially (e.g., two lesions in the upper-left corner).\n- **Internal Structure**: Each lesion has **3–5 concentric rings** (lighter toward the edges, darker at the center), creating a \"target\" or \"bullseye\" pattern. The rings are wavy and slightly distorted, not perfectly circular.\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Secondary Leaves**: 2–3 blurred green leaves in the background:\n  - A large, out-of-focus leaf on the **right side** (occupies ~30% of the frame, edge-to-edge vertically).\n  - Smaller, partially visible leaves on the **top-left** (behind the main leaf’s upper edge) and **bottom-left** (behind the main leaf’s base).\n- **Soil/Debris**: A dark, indistinct area in the **top-right** (between the main leaf and background leaf), suggesting soil or mulch.\n\n#### **Micro-Details**\n- **Trichomes**: Tiny, hair-like structures covering the leaf surface, most dense along **veins** and **leaf edges**. They appear as fine, white/translucent lines.\n- **Dew/Specks**: Minute white dots (1–2 pixels in size) scattered across the leaf, concentrated on the upper half.\n- **Spore Clusters**: Tiny black specks (≤1 pixel) on a few lesions (e.g., bottom-right lesion), likely fungal spores.\n- **Dried Edge**: The **bottom-left corner** of the main leaf has a 5–10 mm brown, crispy edge (damage from dehydration or pests).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is dominated by greens and browns, with subtle variations to mimic natural texture and damage.\n\n#### **Main Leaf**\n- **Base Color**: Bright, yellow-tinged green (#8BC34A) with a matte finish. Areas adjacent to lesions fade to a paler green (#C5E1A5).\n- **Veins**: Darker green (#689F38) with a slightly glossy texture (more reflective than the leaf blade).\n- **Trichomes**: Translucent white (#E0E0E0) with a fuzzy, non-reflective texture.\n- **Dried Edge**: Medium brown (#8D6E63) with a rough, papery texture.\n\n#### **Lesions**\n- **Gradient**: From a dark brown center (#6D4C41) to a light tan edge (#BCA79E). The concentric rings are created by subtle shifts in hue (10–15% lighter per ring) and slight opacity variations (80–100% opacity).\n- **Texture**: Raised and wrinkled, with the central ring being the most elevated. The edges of lesions are slightly curled upward.\n\n#### **Background**\n- **Leaves**: Deep, muted green (#388E3C) with a soft blur (Gaussian blur, radius ~5–10 pixels) to simulate depth of field.\n- **Soil**: Dark brown (#4E342E) with a grainy texture (subtle noise filter).\n\n#### **Micro-Details**\n- **Dew**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with a glossy, reflective texture (small highlight dots).\n- **Spore Clusters**: Jet black (#000000) with a matte finish.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **shallow depth of field** to focus on the main leaf, with the background intentionally blurred. Key spatial cues:\n\n- **Main Leaf**: Foreground, z-index 1 (top layer). It overlaps the background leaves on the left and right.\n- **Central Vein**: Runs diagonally from (0.1, 0.9) to (0.8, 0.1) in normalized coordinates (0 = left/bottom, 1 = right/top).\n- **Lesions**: Positioned relative to the veins:\n  - Upper-left lesions (3 total) are between the central vein and the leaf edge.\n  - Center lesions (4 total) are along the central vein.\n  - Lower-right lesions (3 total) are on the lateral veins.\n- **Background Leaves**: Z-index 0 (bottom layer). The right background leaf is partially obscured by the main leaf’s upper edge.\n- **Trichomes**: Concentrated along the central vein (density: 50–100 per cm²) and leaf edges (density: 30–50 per cm²).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: The image is a close-up macro photograph with high detail (trichomes, lesion texture) and natural lighting.\n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused daylight (no harsh shadows) with subtle highlights on the leaf surface (e.g., dew specks, lesion edges).\n- **Depth of Field**: Shallow (f/2.8–f/4), keeping the main leaf in focus while blurring the background to draw attention to the damage.\n- **Texture Focus**: The artist (photographer) emphasizes the leaf’s tactile qualities—fuzziness of trichomes, roughness of lesions, and crispness of veins.\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these technical details:\n\n#### **Main Leaf Path**\n- **Shape**: Draw using a **Bezier curve** with 6–8 control points to capture the ovate form and slightly wavy edges. The base (bottom-left) is more rounded than the tip (top-right).\n- **Serrations**: Add 15–20 small, irregular \"teeth\" along the edge using short line segments or curved paths. Serrations are ~1–2 mm deep (real-world scale).\n- **Veins**:\n  - **Central Vein**: A thick path (#689F38) with a 2–3 mm stroke width (real-world), tapering from the base (3 mm) to the tip (1 mm).\n  - **Lateral Veins**: Thin paths (#689F38) with a 0.5–1 mm stroke width, branching off the central vein at 45–60° angles. Sub-branches are 0.2–0.5 mm wide.\n\n#### **Lesions**\n- **Shape**: Each lesion is an irregular polygon (4–6 sides) with jagged edges. Use the **pen tool** to draw freehand or import a traced path from the original image.\n- **Concentric Rings**: For each lesion, create 3–5 nested paths (each 1–2 mm smaller than the previous) with gradient fills. The innermost ring is the darkest (#6D4C41), and each subsequent ring is 10–15% lighter (#8D6E63 → #BCA79E).\n- **Texture**: Add a **noise filter** (5–10% intensity) to the lesion fills to mimic the wrinkled, raised surface.\n\n#### **Trichomes**\n- **Method**: Draw 500–1000 tiny lines (#E0E0E0) with a 0.1 mm stroke width. Concentrate them along veins (central > lateral) and leaf edges. Use a **random distribution** (avoid uniform spacing) for a natural look.\n- **Alternative**: Use a **pattern fill** (small dots or lines) applied to the vein paths, with opacity reduced to 50% to avoid cluttering the design.\n\n#### **Dew Specks**\n- **Shape**: 20–30 tiny circles (#FFFFFF) with a 0.5–1 mm diameter. Add a **radial gradient** (white center to transparent edge) to simulate reflection.\n- **Position**: Scatter randomly on the upper half of the leaf, avoiding lesions.\n\n#### **Background**\n- **Leaves**: Draw 2–3 simple ovate paths (#388E3C) with no serrations (blur obscures detail). Apply a **Gaussian blur filter** (radius 5–10 pixels) to the right background leaf; the left background leaves can be slightly less blurred (radius 3–5 pixels).\n- **Soil**: Draw a dark brown (#4E342E) rectangle in the top-right corner, then apply a **noise filter** (15–20% intensity) to mimic texture.\n\n#### **Dried Edge**\n- **Shape**: A triangular path (#8D6E63) at the bottom-left corner, overlapping the main leaf. The edge is rough—use a jagged path to simulate crispy, damaged tissue.\n\n\n### **SVG Layer Structure**\nOrganize elements into layers for easy editing:\n1. **Background**: Soil, background leaves (blurred).\n2. **Main Leaf**: Base shape (fill: #8BC34A), veins (paths), dried edge (path).\n3. **Lesions**: Individual lesion groups (each with concentric rings).\n4. **Trichomes**: Paths or pattern fills.\n5. **Micro-Details**: Dew specks, spore clusters.\n\n\n### **Summary of Key Measurements (Real-World Scale)**\n- **Main Leaf**: 8–10 cm long, 5–6 cm wide.\n- **Central Vein**: 8–10 cm long, 2–3 mm wide at base.\n- **Lesions**: 5–20 mm in diameter (largest at center, smallest at edges).\n- **Trichomes**: 0.5–1 mm long, 0.1 mm wide.\n- **Dew Specks**: 0.5–1 mm in diameter.\n\nBy following this description, an SVG artist can recreate the image with high fidelity, capturing both the natural beauty of the leaf and the detailed damage of the lesions.",
  "v1_198": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this classic 18th-century portrait engraving, the following detailed description breaks down the image into geometric, textural, and compositional elements, with a focus on reproducible details for vector art.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **bust portrait** of a person, centered in a rectangular frame. The primary elements are:  \n- **Head & Hair**: The most prominent feature—long, voluminous curly hair that frames the face and extends to the mid-torso. The hair is divided into two symmetrical sections (left/right of the center) with dozens of individual spiral curls.  \n- **Face**: An oval shape with subtle facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows) and soft shading.  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - **Shirt**: A white linen shirt with a loose, folded collar that opens at the neck, revealing a small button at the collarbone.  \n  - **Coat**: A dark, tailored coat with a lapel (visible on the viewer’s left) that folds over the shirt. The coat covers the torso and upper arms.  \n- **Background**: A **vignette** (softly blurred oval) behind the figure, created with cross-hatching to draw focus to the subject.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is **grayscale** (black, white, and 50+ shades of gray) with a realistic, engraving-style texture. Key textural details:  \n- **Hair**: Each curl has a **gradient fill** (light gray highlight → dark gray shadow) to simulate volume. The curls are dense and overlapping, with a \"shiny\" appearance from sharp highlights.  \n- **Face**: Smooth skin with subtle shading (lighter on the forehead, cheeks, and chin; darker around the eyes, nose, and jawline).  \n- **Shirt**: Bright white with soft gray shading to define folds. The collar has a slightly rough texture from linen.  \n- **Coat**: Dark gray with cross-hatching (diagonal lines) to mimic heavy fabric. Folds are shaded with darker gray to show depth.  \n- **Background**: A radial gradient of gray (dark center → light edges) with **cross-hatching** (diagonal lines, 45° angle) that decreases in density toward the edges. The lines are hand-drawn, with slight irregularities for a organic feel.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe figure is **centered horizontally and vertically** in the image, with the following proportional guidelines (relative to a 1000px × 1200px canvas for reference):  \n- **Head**: Occupies the **upper 1/3** of the canvas (top of hair at 100px, chin at 400px). The face is 200px tall (hairline to chin) and 150px wide, centered at (500px, 250px).  \n- **Hair**: Extends from the top of the head (100px) down to the mid-torso (600px). The left/right sections are symmetrical, each 200px wide at the shoulders.  \n- **Eyes**: Almond-shaped, centered at (420px, 280px) (left) and (580px, 280px) (right). The irises are 15px in diameter, with a 5px white **catchlight** (upper-right quadrant) for depth.  \n- **Nose**: Straight, 50px tall, centered at (500px, 320px). The tip has a 10px light highlight.  \n- **Mouth**: A 30px curved line (slightly downturned) at (500px, 380px). The upper lip is darker than the lower.  \n- **Shirt**: Visible from the collarbone (400px) to the mid-chest (550px). The collar folds over the coat, with a 5px button at (500px, 420px).  \n- **Coat**: Covers the torso (400px → 1200px). The lapel (viewer’s left) is a 100px × 50px folded shape at (350px, 450px).  \n- **Background**: A 1000px × 1200px rectangle with a radial gradient (dark center → light edges) and cross-hatching. The vignette (soft edge) extends 50px beyond the figure’s hair.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **classic portrait engraving**, typical of 18th-century European art (e.g., Hogarth or Reynolds). Key style elements:  \n- **Realism**: Detailed shading (cross-hatching) to create volume and texture.  \n- **Vignette Background**: A soft, blurred edge (radial gradient) to focus on the subject—common in 18th-century portraiture.  \n- **Hair Style**: \"Peruke\" (powdered wig) with tight, symmetrical curls—iconic of the period.  \n- **Facial Expression**: Neutral, with slightly raised eyebrows, a straight nose, and a closed mouth (subtle downturn at the corners).  \n- **Clothing**: Historical accuracy—loose linen shirt with a buttoned collar, over a tailored coat with a lapel.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**\nTo recreate the engraving’s texture and depth, use **vector paths** (for hard edges) and **gradients/patterns** (for shading). Below are critical elements:  \n\n#### **Hair**  \n- **Curls**: Each curl is a **closed bezier path** (spiral shape) with a **linear gradient** (light gray highlight → dark gray shadow). Group curls into left/right sections (5–7 curls per side, overlapping slightly).  \n- **Highlight/Shadow**: For each curl, the highlight is a 10px-wide strip along the inner curve; the shadow is a 15px-wide strip along the outer curve.  \n- **Parting**: Implied center part (no visible line)—curls are evenly distributed on both sides.  \n\n#### **Face**  \n- **Base Shape**: Oval path (200px tall × 150px wide) with a **radial gradient** (light gray center → dark gray edges) to simulate roundness.  \n- **Eyes**:  \n  - Iris: 15px circle (dark gray fill).  \n  - Pupil: 5px circle (black fill), centered in the iris.  \n  - Catchlight: 5px circle (white fill), positioned at 10 o’clock (left eye) and 2 o’clock (right eye).  \n  - Eyebrows: Thin bezier paths (5px wide) with a **linear gradient** (dark gray → light gray) to show depth. Curved slightly upward at the inner corners.  \n- **Nose**: Triangular path (50px tall × 20px wide) with a **linear gradient** (light gray tip → dark gray sides). A 10px highlight at the tip.  \n- **Mouth**: Curved path (30px wide × 5px tall) with a **linear gradient** (dark gray upper lip → light gray lower lip). A 5px shadow below the lower lip.  \n\n#### **Clothing**  \n- **Shirt**:  \n  - **Collar**: Two curved paths (left/right) that fold over the coat. Each collar is 30px tall × 50px wide, with a **linear gradient** (white → light gray) to show folds.  \n  - **Button**: 5px circle (dark gray fill) at the top of the shirt (500px, 420px).  \n  - **Folds**: 3–4 curved paths (vertical) on the chest, shaded with dark gray to simulate loose linen.  \n- **Coat**:  \n  - **Base Shape**: Large rectangle (1000px wide × 800px tall) with a **radial gradient** (dark gray center → light gray edges) to show volume.  \n  - **Lapel**: Folded path (100px × 50px) on the viewer’s left (350px, 450px). Shaded with dark gray to define the fold.  \n  - **Folds**: 2–3 horizontal paths on the torso, shaded with dark gray to mimic fabric creases.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Gradient**: Radial gradient (dark gray #333 at center → light gray #eee at edges) applied to a 1000px × 1200px rectangle.  \n- **Cross-Hatching**:  \n  - **Pattern**: Create a <pattern> element with 1px-wide diagonal lines (45° angle), spaced 5px apart.  \n  - **Mask**: Apply a radial gradient mask (white center → transparent edges) to the pattern rectangle. This makes the cross-hatching denser in the center (behind the head) and sparser toward the edges.  \n  - **Irregularity**: Add slight variations to the line spacing (±1px) to mimic hand-drawn engraving.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout**\nUse the following relative proportions to maintain realism:  \n- **Head-to-Body Ratio**: The head (including hair) is 1/2 the total height of the figure (hair extends from top of head to mid-torso).  \n- **Eye Placement**: Eyes are at the **horizontal center** of the face, 1/3 of the way down from the hairline.  \n- **Hair Width**: The hair is 2x wider than the face at the shoulders (300px wide vs. 150px face).  \n- **Background Vignette**: The dark center of the radial gradient is 2x the width of the face (300px diameter), centered behind the head.  \n\n\n### **7. Final Notes for SVG**\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into groups (e.g., `#hair-left`, `#hair-right`, `#face`, `#clothing`, `#background`) for easy editing.  \n- **Fills**: Use **linear/radial gradients** for 3D shapes (hair, face, clothing) and **pattern fills** for cross-hatching.  \n- **Stroke**: Avoid strokes—engravings use fill shading exclusively.  \n- **Catchlights**: Keep these small (5px) and crisp to maintain the \"lifelike\" look of the eyes.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the engraving’s historical style, texture, and composition—critical for a faithful recreation.",
  "v1_199": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into geometric, textural, spatial, and stylistic elements—with a focus on precision for scalable vector graphics.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is dominated by a **foreground bronze statue** of an elderly figure, set against a **blurred background** of a traditional Chinese building. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Statue (Focal Point)**\n- **Head**: Oval-shaped, with a raised **topknot** (a cylindrical \"cap\" on the crown, ~1/5 the head’s height). The face features deep, carved wrinkles (forehead, between eyebrows, around eyes/mouth), a straight nose, rounded cheeks, and a slight smile.\n- **Beard**: Long, flowing, and split into three main sections (chin, upper chest, lower torso). The beard extends from the jawline to the mid-torso, with individual strands carved to suggest movement.\n- **Neck/Collar**: A **semicircular decorative band** runs from the base of the skull, around the neck, and down the front of the torso. The band features a **repeating spiral/scroll pattern** (12–15 evenly spaced motifs per side).\n- **Torso/Robes**: The figure wears a loose, long-sleeved robe. The torso is a broad, rectangular shape with rounded edges. The sleeves are cylindrical, flaring slightly at the wrists, with deep folds carved along the shoulders and forearms.\n- **Hands**: Clasped at the mid-torso in a gesture of respect (right hand over left, fingers interlaced). The palms are slightly cupped, with visible knuckles and fingernails.\n- **Scroll (Right Side)**: A rectangular \"book\" or scroll is attached to the right hip. It has a flat top, vertical \"binding\" lines (5–7) on the front, and a slightly curved bottom. The scroll is ~1/3 the height of the torso.\n\n#### **Background Building**\n- **Roof**: Horizontal rows of **rectangular clay tiles** (reddish-brown, with dark gray edges) cover the top 1/4 of the image. Tiles are uniform in size, stacked with a slight overlap.\n- **Eaves**: A dark brown horizontal band below the roof, with **blurred decorative carvings** (likely birds or floral motifs) in blue-green. Carvings are symmetrically placed on both left/right sides.\n- **Lower Wall**: A light gray/white horizontal band at the bottom of the image, featuring **vertical rectangular \"railing\" slats** (evenly spaced, ~10–12 per side).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Statue (Bronze Patina)**\n- **Base Color**: Dark gray-green (#4A5A52) with a matte finish.\n- **Highlights**: Lighter gray (#7B827E) on raised surfaces (nose, cheeks, sleeve edges, topknot) to simulate wear/polish.\n- **Textures**: Rough, sculpted surface with fine tool marks (visible in wrinkles, beard strands, and robe folds). The collar’s spiral pattern has a slightly raised, glossy finish compared to the matte robe.\n\n#### **Background**\n- **Roof Tiles**: Reddish-brown (#8B4513) with dark gray (#333333) edges. Tiles have a smooth, slightly worn texture, with subtle green moss (#2F4F2F) in gaps between rows.\n- **Eaves**: Dark brown (#5C3317) base with blue-green (#2E8B57) decorative carvings. Carvings are blurred (low contrast) to mimic depth of field.\n- **Lower Wall**: Light gray (#D3D3D3) with vertical slats in a slightly darker gray (#A9A9A9). Slats have a smooth, uniform texture.\n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Direction**: Soft, diffused light from the front-left, creating gentle highlights on the statue’s face, hands, and sleeve edges.\n- **Shadows**: Subtle, cool-toned shadows (#3A4A42) in crevices (between fingers, under the beard, in robe folds).\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Statue**: Centered in the frame, occupying 70–80% of the vertical height. The head is in the top 1/3 of the image; hands are at the vertical midpoint.\n- **Background**: Blurred (shallow depth of field) to emphasize the statue. Roof tiles are parallel to the top edge; eaves and lower wall are horizontal bands that frame the statue.\n- **Proportions**:\n  - **Statue Height**: ~3x its width (e.g., 1000px tall × 350px wide).\n  - **Head**: 1/5 of the statue’s total height (e.g., 200px tall).\n  - **Beard**: Extends from the chin to 2/3 of the torso height (e.g., 400px long).\n  - **Scroll**: 1/4 the width of the torso (e.g., 80px wide), positioned 1/3 from the bottom of the statue.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Statue**: Realistic, traditional Chinese sculptural style with:\n  - **Naturalistic details**: Wrinkles, beard strands, and robe folds are carved to mimic real fabric/skin.\n  - **Symbolic elements**: Topknot (traditional hairstyle), scroll (scholarship), clasped hands (respect).\n- **Background**: Photographic depth of field translated into SVG via:\n  - **Muted colors**: Background elements are desaturated compared to the statue.\n  - **Reduced detail**: Roof tiles are uniform; eaves carvings are simplified (blurred edges, flat colors).\n- **Overall Tone**: Serene, reverent, with a focus on historical/ cultural authenticity.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No visible text** in the image.\n- **Symbolic Elements**:\n  - **Scroll**: Represents wisdom/scholarship (common in statues of Confucius or other sages).\n  - **Clasped Hands**: A traditional Chinese gesture of greeting or respect (右手在上, yòu shǒu zài shàng: right hand over left).\n- **Sculptural Details**:\n  - **Wrinkles**: 3–4 deep lines on the forehead, 2–3 around each eye, and 1–2 on the cheeks.\n  - **Beard**: 5–6 distinct \"layers\" of strands, with the longest strands in the center.\n  - **Robe Folds**: 4–5 horizontal folds on each sleeve, radiating from the shoulders to the wrists.\n  - **Topknot**: A small, rounded cylinder with a flattened top (like a \"bun\" secured by a hairpin, though no pin is visible).\n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\n- **Foreground (Statue)**:\n  - Use **vector paths** for all details (wrinkles, beard strands, robe folds) to maintain sharpness at any scale.\n  - Apply **gradient fills** (dark gray-green to light gray) on raised surfaces (nose, cheeks, sleeves) to simulate highlights.\n  - The collar’s spiral pattern should be a **repeating vector pattern** (copy/paste for consistency).\n- **Background**:\n  - Use **flat colors** for roof tiles, with a subtle **linear gradient** (light to dark) to add depth.\n  - Eaves carvings: Simplify to **basic shapes** (ovals, curves) in blue-green, with **blur filters** (SVG `<filter>`) to mimic photographic blur.\n  - Lower wall slats: Use **vertical rectangles** with a slight **drop shadow** to separate them from the background.\n- **Depth of Field**:\n  - Make the statue’s edges crisp; background elements (roof, eaves) should have **soft edges** (via `<feGaussianBlur>` in SVG).\n  - Desaturate background colors by 30–40% compared to the statue.\n\n\n### **Summary of Key Proportions (for Scaling)**\n| Element               | Proportion to Statue Height |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Head                  | 1/5                         |\n| Beard Length          | 1/2                         |\n| Scroll Height         | 1/3                         |\n| Sleeve Width (Wrist)  | 1/4 of Torso Width          |\n\nBy adhering to these details—especially the geometric precision, texture模拟 (texture simulation), and spatial hierarchy—the SVG will accurately reflect the original image’s composition, style, and cultural context.",

Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe image is a **photographic freeze-frame** of motion, translated to SVG with:\n- **High Contrast**: Bright red (man’s sweatshirt) and black/white (dog) pop against the muted green background.\n- **Dynamic Pose**: The man’s leaning stance and the dog’s jump create a sense of movement (e.g., dog’s tail is slightly curved, man’s arm is extended).\n- **Bokeh Effect**: Background trees use Gaussian blur to emphasize the foreground (SVG: apply `filter: blur(15px)` to foliage layers).\n- **Realism with Simplification**: Vector shapes mimic photographic details (e.g., fur gradients, grass patterns) without excessive complexity.\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Man’s Sweatshirt**: Small white \"V\" logo (#FFFFFF) on the left chest (550, 550).\n- **Dog’s Eyes**: Almond-shaped black ovals (530, 260) and (510, 260) with white highlights (#FFFFFF) for shine.\n- **Frisbee**: Subtle indent (1px) in the center (200, 200) to simulate depth.\n- **Grass Shadow**: Dark green (#2E7D32) shape under the man’s body (500, 900 to 700, 1000) with blur (radius: 5px).\n- **Dog’s Tail**: Thin rectangle (700, 300 to 780, 310) with a white tip (#FFFFFF) at the end.\n\n\n## 6. Geometric Details for SVG Reproduction\n### Man\n- **Torso**: Rotated rectangle (500, 400 to 700, 700) – **rotate: -45°** (leans forward).\n- **Left Arm**: Rectangle (700, 500 to 900, 540) – **rotate: 30°** (extended forward).\n- **Right Arm**: Rectangle (500, 500 to 600, 600) – **rotate: 90°** (bent at elbow).\n- **Cap**: Semicircle (550, 380 to 650, 420) with a curved brim (rectangle: 550, 400 to 650, 420).\n\n### Dog\n- **Body**: Rotated rectangle (500, 250 to 700, 350) – **rotate: 30°** (jumping forward).\n- **Head**: Oval (500, 200 to 550, 250) with pointed ears (triangles: 530, 200 to 550, 220).\n- **Paws**: Small circles (5px diameter) at (580, 390) and (620, 390) (back paws) and (520, 250) and (540, 250) (front paws).\n\n### Frisbee\n- **Outer Circle**: 80px diameter (150, 150 to 250, 250) – fill: #F57C00 (rim).\n- **Inner Circle**: 60px diameter (170, 170 to 230, 230) – fill: #FF9800 (center).\n\n\n## 7. Notes for SVG Implementation\n- **Grass Texture**: Use a **pattern** of small green triangles (1–5px) repeated across the grass layer. Example:\n  ```svg\n  <pattern id=\"grass\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n    <polygon points=\"0,10 5,0 10,10\" fill=\"#8BC34A\"/>\n    <polygon points=\"2,10 7,2 12,10\" fill=\"#388E3C\"/>\n  </pattern>\n  ```\n- **Fur**: Simulate with **directional gradients** (e.g., dog’s back: black to dark gray, top to bottom).\n- **Blur**: Apply `filter: blur(15px)` to background tree foliage and `filter: blur(5px)` to grass shadows.\n- **Movement**: Frisbee uses a **radial gradient** (light to dark orange) to simulate spin; dog’s tail is slightly curved to suggest motion.\n\n\nThis description provides all necessary information to recreate the image as a precise, visually accurate SVG—balancing photographic realism with vector simplicity. Adjustments to blur, gradients, or patterns can be made to match the desired level of detail.",
  "v1_200": "To facilitate accurate SVG recreation of this traditional Chinese woodblock print, the following detailed description breaks down the image by **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and text/symbols**, with precise geometric, proportional, and layout information.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a symmetrical, folk-art composition centered on a **revered central figure** (likely a Taoist master) flanked by four attendants, with ritual animals and a canopy above. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Central Figure (Focal Point)**\n- **Head**: A large circle (≈0.2× image width, \\(W\\)) with a rounded, slightly squared jaw. Topped with a **headdress**: a semicircular \"crown\" with a curved top edge and three vertical decorative lines on the front (centered).\n- **Face**: Exaggerated features: thick, curved eyebrows; narrow, slanted eyes; a wide, straight nose; a full beard (three distinct parts: two long side whiskers and a central goatee, all extending to the chest).\n- **Body**: A rectangular torso (≈0.3× \\(W\\) wide, 0.4× image height, \\(H\\) tall) with rounded shoulders, tapering to the waist. The lower half is a \"skirt\" with 3–4 horizontal fold lines indicating fabric.\n- **Hands**: Clasped in front, holding a small, indistinct ritual object (possibly a fan or seal).\n\n#### **Surrounding Attendants (4 total)**\nPositioned at the **corners of the middle section**, each is ≈50% the size of the central figure. All stand upright with slight forward leans, wearing traditional robes with fold lines:\n- **Top-Left Attendant**: Simple topknot hairstyle; right hand raised to chest (holding a thin staff or scroll); left hand at side.\n- **Bottom-Left Attendant**: Square, flat-topped hat; hands clasped in a ritual gesture (palms together, at chest level).\n- **Top-Right Attendant**: Topknot hairstyle; left hand holding a small, round object (possibly a ritual token); right hand at side.\n- **Bottom-Right Attendant**: Tall, narrow, cylindrical hat; hands clasped in the same ritual gesture as the bottom-left attendant.\n\n#### **Ritual Table (In Front of Central Figure)**\n- A low, rectangular table (≈0.4× \\(W\\) wide, 0.05× \\(H\\) tall) with rounded edges. Centered horizontally below the central figure’s hands.\n- **Items on Table**: \n  - **Left**: A scroll/paper with 4–5 horizontal Chinese characters (indistinct, but stylized as thin lines).\n  - **Right**: A round, lidded container (possibly a censer or offering bowl).\n\n#### **Animals (Below Table)**\nTwo symbolic creatures, each ≈0.15× \\(H\\) tall and 0.15× \\(W\\) wide, positioned at the **lower left/right corners**:\n- **Left Animal (Tiger/Dog)**: A quadruped with a curved back, short legs (in a \"running\" pose), a bushy tail, and a head with pointed ears. Body is solid black (no internal details).\n- **Right Animal (Rooster)**: A bird with a comb, wattle, spread tail feathers (3–4 long, curved lines), and legs in a standing pose. Outlined in black with thin internal lines for feathers.\n\n#### **Canopy (Above Central Figure)**\n- A wide, horizontal band (≈0.2× \\(H\\) tall) spanning the entire image width (\\(W\\)). \n- **Pattern**: A border of alternating thick/thin horizontal lines at the top and bottom, with a central field of dense, parallel horizontal lines (≈10 lines per 0.01× \\(H\\)).\n- **Stars**: Five small, five-pointed stars (≈0.01× \\(W\\) in diameter) on either side of the canopy (2 left, 3 right), evenly spaced.\n\n#### **Text (Top of Image)**\n- A single line of **traditional Chinese characters**: **師祖陶公禁鬼局** (Shīzǔ Táo Gōng Jìn Guǐ Jú), translating to \"Ancestor Master Tao’s Ghost-Banishing Bureau.\" \n- **Style**: Serif font with squared edges, centered horizontally. Each character is ≈0.05× \\(H\\) tall, with slight spacing between them.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is **monochromatic (black-and-white)**, consistent with woodblock print aesthetics. Key texture and value details:\n- **Central Figure**: Bold, thick outlines (≈1.5–2px) with solid black fills for the beard, headdress, and clothing folds. The face/skin is white (negative space) with thin line details (eyebrows, eyes, nose).\n- **Attendants**: Thinner outlines (≈1px) with lighter fills (white skin, grayish robes). Clothing folds are indicated by thin, sparse lines.\n- **Canopy**: Thin, dense lines (≈0.5px) for the central pattern, creating a \"textured\" appearance. Borders are thicker (≈1px).\n- **Animals**: Left animal is solid black (high contrast); right animal is outlined with thin internal lines (low contrast).\n- **Text**: Solid black, with slight \"bleed\" (common in woodblock prints) to give a hand-carved look.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is divided into **three horizontal tiers** (top, middle, bottom) with strict symmetry around the vertical center (\\(x = 0.5W\\)):\n\n| Tier | Vertical Range | Elements | Positioning |\n|------|----------------|----------|-------------|\n| **Top** | \\(0–0.2H\\) | Text, Canopy | - Text: Centered at \\(x = 0.5W\\), \\(y = 0.05H\\).<br>- Canopy: Spans \\(x = 0–W\\), \\(y = 0.1–0.2H\\) (below text). |\n| **Middle** | \\(0.2–0.6H\\) | Central Figure, Attendants, Table | - Central Figure: Centered at \\(x = 0.5W\\), \\(y = 0.4H\\) (head at \\(y = 0.2H\\), waist at \\(y = 0.6H\\)).<br>- Attendants: <br>  - Top-left: \\(x = 0.15W\\), \\(y = 0.25H\\)<br>  - Bottom-left: \\(x = 0.15W\\), \\(y = 0.55H\\)<br>  - Top-right: \\(x = 0.85W\\), \\(y = 0.25H\\)<br>  - Bottom-right: \\(x = 0.85W\\), \\(y = 0.55H\\)<br>- Table: Centered at \\(x = 0.5W\\), \\(y = 0.525H\\) (spans \\(x = 0.3–0.7W\\)). |\n| **Bottom** | \\(0.6–1.0H\\) | Animals | - Left animal: \\(x = 0.2W\\), \\(y = 0.75H\\)<br>- Right animal: \\(x = 0.8W\\), \\(y = 0.75H\\) |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image follows **traditional Chinese woodblock print aesthetics** with the following key traits:\n- **Bold Outlines**: Thick, crisp lines (varying in weight by importance—central figure > attendants > background).\n- **Flat Colors**: No gradients or shading; fills are solid black or white (negative space).\n- **Exaggerated Proportions**: The central figure is 2–3× larger than attendants, emphasizing their authority.\n- **Symmetry**: Left/right elements (attendants, animals) mirror each other, creating balance.\n- ** Folk-Art Simplification**: Minimal detail in secondary elements (attendants, animals) to keep focus on the central figure.\n- **Woodblock Texture**: Subtle \"roughness\" in lines (simulated by slight irregularities in SVG paths) to mimic hand-carved wood.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**\n- **Characters**: **師祖陶公禁鬼局** (confirmed via visual match to common Taoist folk art).  \n- **Font**: Traditional \"Songti\" (serif) with squared strokes, typical of ritual texts.  \n- **Position**: Centered above the canopy, with a 5% margin from the top edge.\n\n#### **Symbols**\n- **Central Figure’s Headdress**: Indicates authority (common in Taoist/folk deity depictions).  \n- **Ritual Table Items**: Scroll (symbolizes wisdom/scripture) and censer (symbolizes offerings).  \n- **Animals**: Tiger (protection, yang energy) and rooster (warding off evil spirits, associated with dawn).  \n- **Canopy**: Represents divine or ritual space (common in temple art).\n\n#### **Minor Details**\n- **Central Figure’s Hands**: Clasped in a \"ritual mudra\" (hand gesture), likely for casting spells or blessings.  \n- **Attendants’ Poses**: Clasped hands (bottom-left/right) indicate respect; raised objects (top-left/right) suggest they are assisting in the ritual.  \n- **Table Edges**: Rounded to soften the harshness of the rectangular shape (common in folk art).  \n- **Star Placement**: Asymmetrical (2 left, 3 right) to avoid rigid symmetry, adding visual interest.\n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these technical specifications:\n- **Canvas**: Use a rectangular artboard (e.g., 1000px × 1200px) to maintain proportionality.  \n- **Lines**: \n  - Central figure: 1.5–2px stroke width, black (#000000).  \n  - Attendants/animals: 1px stroke width, black.  \n  - Canopy/table: 0.5–1px stroke width, black.  \n- **Fills**: \n  - Central figure’s beard/headdress: Solid black.  \n  - Left animal: Solid black.  \n  - All other elements: White (negative space) unless specified.  \n- **Text**: Use a \"Songti\" (serif) font (e.g., \"Noto Serif CJK SC\") with 50px size, centered.  \n- **Symmetry**: Align left/right elements (attendants, animals) using the vertical center (\\(x = 500px\\) for a 1000px width).  \n- **Texture**: Add subtle \"noise\" (1–2% Gaussian blur) to lines to mimic woodblock grain (optional but recommended for authenticity).\n\n\nThis description provides all necessary information to recreate the image as a precise, stylistically accurate SVG. The symmetry, proportionality, and woodblock-specific details are critical to maintaining the original folk-art character.",
  "v1_201": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this Renaissance portrait (likely 16th-century, attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder or a contemporary), the following detailed breakdown of **main elements, colors, spatial relationships, style, and technical specifications** is provided. The description prioritizes geometric precision, texture, and compositional logic to guide vectorization.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **vertical portrait (9:16 aspect ratio)** centered on a standing male figure. Key elements include:  \n- **Figure**: Occupies 85% of the image height, with a balanced, upright posture.  \n  - **Head**: Oval shape, tilted slightly to the viewer’s right.  \n  - **Hat**: A **capotain** (16th-century tall-brimmed hat) with a cylindrical crown and wide, curved brim. The brim is wider at the front/sides (semicircular) and narrower at the back.  \n  - **Hair**: Curly, visible around the hat’s edges (sides/back) as a series of small, overlapping curves.  \n  - **Face**: Realistic features with a slight smile, eyes gazing to the viewer’s right.  \n  - **Clothing**:  \n    - **Cloak**: A loose, floor-length garment draped over the shoulders. Shaped as a large trapezoid with straight edges, falling from the shoulders to the image bottom.  \n    - **Chemise**: A white, ruffled collar (**piccadilly**) framing the neck, and cuffs visible at the wrists. The collar is a semicircle with a ruffled edge (series of small waves).  \n    - **Inner Tunic**: A tight-fitting, dark garment under the cloak, visible at the neck and wrists.  \n  - **Hands**:  \n    - **Right Hand (viewer’s left)**: Resting on the chest, palm down, fingers spread (thumb left, pinky right).  \n    - **Left Hand (viewer’s right)**: Resting at the bottom edge, palm down, fingers slightly curled.  \n- **Background**: A plain, radial gradient (vignetting) centered on the figure’s face.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are muted and earthy, with strong contrast between the dark figure and light background. Textures emphasize material realism (e.g., wool, linen, flesh).  \n\n| Element               | Color (Hex)       | Texture/Visual Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Hat**               | `#1A1A1A` (black) | Felt-like: Slightly rough, matte finish with subtle grain.                          |\n| **Hair**              | `#4D3319` (brown) | Curly: Overlapping small curves with subtle highlights (`#664422`).                |\n| **Skin (Face/Hands)** | `#F0D0B0` (flesh) | Matte with subtle porosity; shadows (`#C0A080`) on the right side (light source left). |\n| **Cloak**             | `#333333` (dark gray) | Wool: Subtle herringbone texture, matte with soft folds (shadows `#222222`).         |\n| **Chemise Collar/Cuffs** | `#FFFFFF` (white) | Linen: Ruffled edges (series of small waves) with faint shadows (`#E0E0E0`) in folds. |\n| **Inner Tunic**       | `#000000` (black) | Smooth, matte, tight-fitting.                                                       |\n| **Background**        | Gradient: `#D0D0D0` (center) → `#1A1A1A` (edges) | Radial vignetting: Smooth, no texture, draws focus to the figure.                   |\n| **Text**              | `#000000` (black) | Serif font (e.g., Garamond) with slight italicization for Latin phrases.            |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centered and balanced**, with the figure occupying 80% of the image width and 90% of the height. Key spatial hierarchy:  \n- **Head**: Upper 1/3 of the image, centered. The hat covers the top 2/3 of the head, with hair visible on the sides/back.  \n- **Torso**: Middle 1/3, dominated by the cloak. The chemise collar frames the neck, sitting *under* the cloak.  \n- **Hands**: Lower 1/3. The right hand (on chest) is in the **upper middle** (1/2 height), while the left hand (resting) is near the **bottom edge** (3/4 height).  \n- **Background**: The radial gradient is centered on the figure’s face, with the lightest point at the **bridge of the nose** (focal point).  \n\n#### **Key Proportions**  \n- **Hat**: 1/3 of the head height; brim width = 1.5x head width.  \n- **Chemise Collar**: 1/5 of the neck height; ruffle depth = 1/10 of collar width.  \n- **Hand on Chest**: 1/4 of the torso width; fingers = 1/3 of hand length.  \n- **Cloak**: Drapes from shoulders to image bottom (2/3 of figure height); shoulder width = 1.2x head width.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe portrait adheres to **Renaissance realism** (16th-century Northern European), with:  \n- **Chiaroscuro**: Strong light/dark contrast (e.g., left side of face/hand lit, right side in shadow) to create depth.  \n- **Sfumato**: Soft, blended edges (e.g., hair/hat, skin/cloak) for naturalism.  \n- **Balanced Composition**: Figure centered, with symmetrical weight (left/right shoulders, hands) and a plain background to emphasize the subject.  \n- **Naturalistic Expression**: Slight smile, gaze directed off-center (viewer’s right) for psychological depth.  \n- **Linear Perspective**: Subtle foreshortening in the hands (e.g., fingers receding into the chest).  \n- **Status Signifiers**: The cloak (wool) and chemise (linen) indicate noble/aristocratic status.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \n- **Content**: Latin inscription at the **top center**, split into two lines:  \n  - Line 1: `HERCVLES GELRICI D.G. ARCHIDVX SAXONVM`  \n  - Line 2: `GOTICORVM DVX BRANDENBVRGENSIS`  \n- **Style**: Serif font (e.g., Garamond) with uppercase letters, spaced evenly.  \n- **Position**: Centered horizontally, 5% from the top edge. Each line is 80% of the image width.  \n- **Color**: `#000000` (black) against the lighter background gradient.  \n\n#### **Symbols**  \n- **Hand Gesture**: The right hand on the chest is a Renaissance sign of **sincerity** or **respect**.  \n- **Clothing**: The cloak’s length and the chemise’s ruffle indicate the subject’s high social rank (likely a noble/archduke).  \n\n#### **Specific Details**  \n- **Eyes**: Brown (`#4D3319`) with a small catchlight (`#FFFFFF`) on the left side (light source).  \n- **Nose**: Straight, with a subtle shadow (`#C0A080`) under the bridge.  \n- **Mouth**: Closed, with a slight upward curve (smile) and shadow (`#A08060`) at the corners.  \n- **Cloak Fold**: A prominent fold on the **left shoulder** (viewer’s left) creates a shadow (`#222222`), adding texture.  \n- **Cuffs**: White linen cuffs at both wrists, folded back (1/10 of wrist width) to show the chemise.  \n- **Hair**: Curly strands visible at the hat’s edges (sides/back), with 3–4 distinct curls per side.  \n\n\n### **6. Technical Specifications for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, the SVG should:  \n- **Layer Structure**: Separate layers for background, figure (hat, hair, face, cloak, chemise, tunic, hands), and text.  \n- **Gradients**: The background uses a **radial gradient** with the center at (50%, 30%) (aligned with the face) and a radius of 80%.  \n- **Paths**:  \n  - **Hat**: Combine a rectangle (crown) with a semicircle (brim).  \n  - **Chemise Collar**: A semicircle with a dashed/dotted edge (simulating ruffles) or a series of small curves.  \n  - **Hands**: Use Bezier curves for palms/fingers, with subtle indentations for knuckles.  \n- **Text**: Convert the Latin inscription to a **vector font** (e.g., Garamond) to maintain scalability.  \n- **Shadows**: Use **linear gradients** or **opacity masks** for soft shadows (e.g., right side of face, cloak folds).  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\nThe SVG must prioritize **geometric precision** (e.g., hat brim shape, chemise ruffles) and **textural realism** (e.g., cloak wool, skin pores) while adhering to Renaissance compositional rules (centering, vignetting). Key constraints include:  \n- **Color Palette**: Muted earth tones with high contrast between figure and background.  \n- **Layout**: Vertical portrait orientation with the figure occupying 85% of the height.  \n- **Text**: Accurate Latin inscription at the top, using a serif font.  \n- **Lighting**: Consistent left-side light source with shadows on the right.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will replicate the original portrait’s Renaissance realism and structural integrity.",
  "v1_202": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this black-and-white photographic portrait, the following detailed breakdown of **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** is essential. The image features Albert Einstein as the focal point, with a shallow depth of field emphasizing his face while blurring foreground/background elements.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is centered on **Albert Einstein’s head and upper torso**, with three key layers:  \n- **Foreground**: Blurred, indistinct shapes (likely hands or objects) framing the left and right edges.  \n- **Midground (Focal Point)**: Einstein’s face, hair, and collar, in sharp focus.  \n- **Background**: Dense, out-of-focus foliage (trees/leaves).  \n\n#### **Einstein’s Facial Features**  \n- **Eyes**: Almond-shaped, with curved upper eyelids (covering ~1/3 of the iris) and subtle lower eyelids. Small, round pupils (~1/4 the size of the iris) are positioned in the upper half of the eye, giving a \"twinkling\" effect.  \n- **Eyebrows**: Thin, curved arcs above each eye, starting at the inner corner and arching upward toward the outer edge. Made of 3–4 short, wispy paths to mimic hair texture.  \n- **Wrinkles**:  \n  - **Crow’s Feet**: 3–4 short, curved lines at the outer corners of each eye, fanning outward.  \n  - **Forehead**: 1–2 faint, horizontal lines above the eyebrows (subtle, not prominent).  \n  - **Under Eyes**: Thin, curved lines below each lower eyelid, following the eye’s shape.  \n- **Nose**: Straight bridge, with a rounded tip. The nostrils are small, oval shapes at the base.  \n- **Mustache**: A thin, curved \"horseshoe\" shape spanning the space between the nose and upper lip. Wider at the center (~1/2 the width of the mouth) and tapering toward the cheeks.  \n- **Mouth**: A broad, upward-curved smile with lifted corners. The upper lip is a thin, curved line (with a slight \"cupid’s bow\" indent at the center), and the lower lip is a thicker, rounded curve. A hint of teeth is visible at the center (2–3 small, rectangular shapes).  \n- **Jawline**: Softly rounded, merging into the neck. The chin is slightly protruding.  \n\n#### **Hair**  \nIconic, wild, curly hair that frames the face and sticks upward in irregular tufts. Key shapes:  \n- **Top**: A mass of 15–20 long, wavy paths (1–2x the height of the forehead) sticking straight up, with varying lengths and curves.  \n- **Sides**: Shorter, curvier paths (1/2–3/4 the height of the forehead) framing the cheeks and ears, overlapping slightly with the face.  \n- **Back**: Longer strands cascading down the neck, blending into the background.  \n- **Texture**: Each hair strand is a thin, wavy path with a slight taper at the end. Overlapping strands create depth.  \n\n#### **Clothing**  \nA **collared sweater/cardigan** covering the upper torso:  \n- **Collar**: A wide (~1/4 the height of the neck), folded-over band with rounded edges. The top edge curves slightly outward, and the bottom edge meets the sweater at the center of the chest. A small, round button (~1/8 the width of the collar) is positioned at the collar’s center.  \n- **Sweater Body**: A large, loose-fitting shape covering the chest and shoulders. The fabric has a textured, wool-like appearance (see **Textures** below).  \n\n#### **Foreground**  \nTwo blurred, indistinct shapes framing the left and right edges:  \n- **Left**: A large, irregular oval (~25% of the image width) occupying the lower-left quadrant. Soft, feathered edges (blur radius ~10–15px in SVG).  \n- **Right**: A smaller, irregular oval (~15% of the image width) in the lower-right quadrant, overlapping Einstein’s shoulder.同样 soft edges.  \n\n#### **Background**  \nDense foliage (trees/leaves) filling the entire background:  \n- **Leaves**: Hundreds of small, irregular shapes (ovals, teardrops, jagged edges) in varying sizes (1–5% of the image width). Arranged in overlapping layers to create depth.  \n- **Light Spots**: ~30–40 small, light-gray shapes (1–3% of the image width) scattered throughout the background, mimicking sunlight filtering through leaves.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \nThe image is **grayscale** (0–255 values), with contrast emphasizing the focal point:  \n\n| Element               | Tone (Grayscale) | Texture/Visual Properties                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Hair**              | 220–255 (white)  | Fuzzy, wispy; individual strands have subtle gradient (lighter at tips, darker at roots). |\n| **Face**              | 150–200 (light)  | Smooth skin with subtle shadows (under eyes, nose, jawline) and highlights (forehead, cheeks). |\n| **Mustache/Eyebrows** | 100–150 (mid)    | Thin, hair-like paths with slight texture (varied line weight).                           |\n| **Clothing**          | 100–140 (mid)    | Wool texture: small, irregular dots/lines (~1px size) in 80–120 grayscale, spaced 2–3px apart. |\n| **Foreground**        | 50–80 (dark)     | Blurred (Gaussian blur, σ=5–10) with soft edges; uniform tone.                             |\n| **Background**        | 30–70 (dark)     | Leaves: varying tones (30–70) with light spots (150–200). Soft focus (blur σ=3–5).         |\n\n#### **Key Textures for SVG**  \n- **Hair**: Use **multiple overlapping paths** with `stroke` (1–2px) and `fill` (220–255) to mimic fuzziness. Add a `feather` filter to strand tips for softness.  \n- **Clothing**: Create a **pattern element** (`<pattern>`) with small, irregular `rect`/`circle` shapes (1px) in 80–120 grayscale. Apply this pattern to the sweater path.  \n- **Background Leaves**: Use a **group** of `path` elements (varying shapes) with `fill` (30–70) and `opacity` (0.7–1.0). Add a `blur` filter to the entire background group for soft focus.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe composition uses **rule of thirds** with Einstein’s eyes at the focal point. Key proportions:  \n\n| Element               | Position/Proportion                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Einstein’s Face**   | Centered horizontally; eyes at 1/3 of the image height (from top).                  |\n| **Hair**              | Extends 1.5x the face height above the forehead; width = 1.2x the face width.       |\n| **Collar**            | Covers the lower 1/3 of the neck; centered horizontally.                             |\n| **Foreground Shapes** | Left shape: occupies 20% of the left edge (width) and 40% of the bottom (height).   |\n|                       | Right shape: occupies 15% of the right edge (width) and 25% of the bottom (height). |\n| **Background**        | Fills 100% of the image; leaves are denser at the top and sides, sparser in the center. |\n\n#### **Depth Cues**  \n- **Focus**: Einstein’s face/hair are **sharp** (no blur); foreground/background are **blurred** (increasing blur with distance).  \n- **Overlap**: Foreground shapes overlap the left/right edges of Einstein’s body, framing him.  \n- **Tone**: Foreground (dark) → Einstein (light/mid) → Background (dark) creates a \"frame-within-a-frame\" effect.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \nThe image is a **photographic portrait** with:  \n- **Shallow Depth of Field**: Emphasizes Einstein’s face while de-emphasizing foreground/background.  \n- **Soft Natural Lighting**: Even illumination on the face (no harsh shadows) suggests outdoor sunlight (likely overcast or late afternoon).  \n- **Informal Pose**: Einstein’s relaxed smile, wild hair, and loose clothing convey a casual, approachable mood.  \n\n#### **SVG Translation Notes**  \n- **Photographic Realism**: Use **gradients** for facial shadows/highlights (e.g., a linear gradient from 180 (forehead) to 150 (cheeks) for the face).  \n- **Blur Effects**: Use SVG’s `<filter>` element (e.g., `<feGaussianBlur>`) for foreground/background blur. Adjust `stdDeviation` to match depth (foreground: σ=5–10; background: σ=3–5).  \n- **Hair Realism**: Avoid uniform shapes—use **randomized path lengths/curves** to mimic natural hair. Add a `feDropShadow` filter to hair strands for subtle depth.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n- **No Text/Symbols**: The image contains no visible text or symbolic elements.  \n- **Micro-Details**:  \n  - **Eyelashes**: 2–3 short, curved paths at the outer corner of each eye (1px stroke, 100–150 grayscale).  \n  - **Ear**: Partially visible behind the hair on the right side—small, curved shape with a subtle lobe.  \n  - **Collar Button**: A small circle (2px diameter) at the center of the collar, filled with 80–100 grayscale (darker than the collar).  \n  - **Leaf Variation**: Background leaves have varying shapes (oval, teardrop, jagged) to avoid repetition. Light spots are randomly distributed (more in the upper half).  \n\n\n### **6. Critical Proportions for SVG**  \nTo ensure accuracy, use the following proportional guidelines (based on the image’s overall width/height, assumed to be 1000px × 1000px for reference):  \n\n| Element               | Proportion (Relative to Image Width/Height) |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Einstein’s Face**   | Width: 60% (600px); Height: 40% (400px)     |\n| **Hair**              | Width: 70% (700px); Height: 50% (500px)     |\n| **Collar**            | Width: 40% (400px); Height: 5% (50px)       |\n| **Foreground Left**   | Width: 20% (200px); Height: 40% (400px)     |\n| **Foreground Right**  | Width: 15% (150px); Height: 25% (250px)     |\n| **Eye间距**           | 20% of face width (120px)                   |\n| **Mustache Length**   | 80% of face width (480px)                   |\n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**  \n1. **Focal Point**: Start with Einstein’s face (eyes, mustache, smile) using precise shapes and gradients for realism.  \n2. **Hair**: Add hundreds of small, wavy paths with blur/feather effects to mimic fuzziness.  \n3. **Clothing**: Use a pattern for the wool texture and a folded collar with a button.  \n4. **Foreground/Background**: Apply Gaussian blur to framing elements and leafy background, using tone variation for depth.  \n5. **Lighting**: Add subtle gradients to the face/clothing for soft shadows/highlights.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the photographic style, mood, and iconic features of the image.",
  "v1_203": "To accurately recreate this 19th-century portrait photograph as an SVG, below is a detailed, geometrically precise description of its elements, proportions, and visual properties. The image is a **realistic, formal portrait of a man** with a focus on natural lighting, subtle texture, and a classic vignette frame.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition centers on a **human head and upper torso** turned ~30° to the right (3/4 profile). Key elements include:  \n- **Head**: Oval shape (slightly flattened at the jaw),占据 ~70% of the image height, centered vertically and horizontally.  \n- **Face**: Subtly angled, with features arranged in a classic facial ratio (eyes:upper 1/3; nose:middle 1/3; mouth:lower 1/3).  \n- **Hair**: Short, tousled strands starting at a curved hairline (forehead to temples) and extending upward/backward.  \n- **Ears**: Left ear fully visible (complex, cartilaginous shape); right ear hidden by the head turn.  \n- **Facial Hair**: Full mustache (connected to a goatee) with stubble on cheeks.  \n- **Clothing**: High-collared white shirt, wide bow tie, and single-breasted dark suit jacket.  \n- **Background**: Solid gradient with a vignette (darker edges, lighter center).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is a **grayscale photograph** with tones ranging from deep black (#000000) to light gray (#EEEEEE). Key texture and color details:  \n- **Skin**: Matte, with subtle shadows (under eyes, nose, chin) and highlights (cheekbones, forehead). Tones shift from medium gray (#888888) on the face to light gray (#AAAAAA) on the forehead and cheeks (lit from the left).  \n- **Hair**: Rough, textured appearance with dark gray (#333333) base and lighter gray (#666666) strands (especially at temples).  \n- **Facial Hair**: Stubby, with the mustache/goatee being lighter (#777777) than the cheek stubble (#555555).  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - **Shirt**: Bright white (#FFFFFF) collar and front, with crisp edges.  \n  - **Bow Tie**: Dark gray (#222222) with a subtle sheen (highlight on the knot).  \n  - **Suit Jacket**: Deep gray (#111111) with smooth fabric folds (represented by lighter gray (#444444) lines).  \n- **Background**: Radial gradient from dark gray (#222222) at the edges to light gray (#888888) in the center (vignette effect).  \n- **Highlights**: Small white (#FFFFFF) ellipses in the upper-right of each eye (light source reflection).\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nAll elements are arranged to draw attention to the face, with the following proportional and positional rules:  \n- **Head**: Centered in the image, with the top of the hair at ~10% of the image height and the chin at ~60% of the image height.  \n- **Face Angle**: Turned ~30° to the right, so the left cheek is more visible than the right.  \n- **Eyes**: Positioned in the **upper 1/3** of the face, spaced 1 eye-width apart. The left eye is fully visible; the right eye is partially obscured by the brow.  \n- **Eyebrows**: Thick, arched lines sitting ~5% above the eyes, with the left brow slightly higher (due to the head turn).  \n- **Nose**: Straight bridge, occupying the **middle 1/3** of the face. The tip of the nose aligns with the center of the mouth.  \n- **Mouth**: Closed, slightly downturned, in the **lower 1/3** of the face. Width = 1.5x the nose width.  \n- **Beard**: Mustache covers the upper lip, extending to the corners of the mouth; goatee connects to the mustache, rounding at the chin.  \n- **Clothing**:  \n  - **Collar**: High (~40px tall in a 1000px image), folding over the bow tie. The left collar is more visible.  \n  - **Bow Tie**: Centered under the collar, with wings extending to the jawline.  \n  - **Suit Jacket**: Covers the torso, with shoulders sloping slightly. Two buttons are visible: one at the chest (1/2 way down the jacket) and one at the waist (3/4 way down).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image follows **19th-century portrait photography conventions**:  \n- **Realism**: Hyper-detailed focus on facial features, skin texture, and clothing.  \n- **Vignette**: Darkened edges to frame the subject, a common artistic choice to isolate the face.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the **left** (evident in brighter right cheek, shadows on left nose/eye).  \n- **Mood**: Formal and serious, typical of Victorian-era portraiture.  \n- **Texture Contrast**: Rough hair/facial hair vs. smooth suit/shirt, adding depth.\n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these geometric and textural details:  \n- **Eyes**: Almond-shaped ellipses (#333333) with a small white highlight (#FFFFFF) in the upper-right. Pupils are black (#000000) circles, 1/3 the eye width.  \n- **Eyebrows**: Curved Bezier curves (#333333) with varying thickness (thicker at the inner corners, tapering outward).  \n- **Nose**: Triangular shape with a curved base (#888888). The bridge is a straight line; the tip is rounded.  \n- **Mouth**: Straight line with a slight downward curve (#333333), 1/8 the face width.  \n- **Hair**: Overlapping curved lines (#333333) with lighter gray (#666666) strands at the temples. Strands are short (~10–20px) and tousled.  \n- **Ears**: Left ear is a complex shape:  \n  - **Helix**: Outer edge (curved line #888888).  \n  - **Antihelix**: Inner curve (curved line #777777).  \n  - **Concha**: Inner bowl (dark ellipse #555555).  \n  - **Earlobe**: Rounded shape (#888888) at the bottom.  \n- **Bow Tie**:  \n  - **Wings**: Two large curved shapes (#222222) on either side, 100px wide × 50px tall.  \n  - **Knot**: Central rectangle (#222222), 30px wide × 20px tall, with a white highlight (#FFFFFF) on the top.  \n  - **Shirt Front**: Small triangle (#FFFFFF) below the knot.  \n- **Suit Jacket**:  \n  - **Lapels**: Two curved shapes (#111111) meeting at the collar. The left lapel has a buttonhole (small rectangle #444444) above the left button.  \n  - **Buttons**: Small circles (#666666) with a white highlight (#FFFFFF), 5px diameter.  \n- **Collar**: Two curved shapes (#FFFFFF) meeting at the back, with a high neck (~40px tall) that folds over the bow tie.  \n- **Shadows**:  \n  - **Under Eyes**: Subtle dark ellipses (#555555) below each eye.  \n  - **Under Nose**: Small dark triangle (#555555) at the base of the nose.  \n  - **Neck**: Curved shape (#555555) from the jawline to the collar.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportional Guidelines (for SVG Scaling)**\nUse these ratios to maintain accuracy regardless of image size:  \n- **Head**: 70% of image height, 60% of image width.  \n- **Eyes**: 1/10 of head height, spaced 1 eye-width apart.  \n- **Nose**: 1/7 of head height, 1/12 of head width.  \n- **Mouth**: 1/8 of head width, 1/20 of head height.  \n- **Bow Tie**: 1/3 of collar width, 1/5 of collar height.  \n- **Vignette**: Radial gradient with stops at 0% (dark gray #222222), 50% (medium gray #555555), 100% (light gray #888888).  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\nThe SVG should prioritize **geometric precision** (e.g., ellipses for eyes, Bezier curves for hair) and **textural subtlety** (e.g., hatching for beard stubble, gradients for skin shadows). The vignette, lighting, and facial proportions are critical to capturing the 19th-century portrait style. Use layers to separate elements (e.g., hair, face, clothing) for easy editing, and include subtle highlights/shadows to mimic the original photograph’s depth.",

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nThe palette is **muted and realistic**, with subtle gradients for depth and texture:\n\n| Element               | Base Color       | Highlights/Shadows                | Texture Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Background**        | Radial Gradient  | Center: Light sage (`#8F9779`)<br>Edges: Dark olive (`#3D4231`) | Smooth, no texture; gradient creates a \"spotlight\" on the face.                |\n| **Skin**              | Beige (`#F0D8C8`) | Wrinkles: Darker beige (`#E0C0A8`)<br>Cheeks: Pink (`#F8E0D0`) | Fine lines (forehead, crow’s feet) using low-opacity dark gradients.           |\n| **Hair/Beard**        | Gray (`#666666`)  | Highlights: White (`#FFFFFF`)      | Curly, textured strands; use multiple small paths for volume.                  |\n| **Collar**            | White (`#FFFFFF`) | Folds: Gray (`#CCCCCC`)            | Linen-like roughness; gradient for fold shadows.                               |\n| **Garment**           | Dark Blue/Black (`#1A1A1A`) | Sheen: Low-opacity white          | Smooth, velvet-like; subtle gradient for depth.                                |\n| **Eyes**              | Iris: Brown (`#4D3319`)<br>Pupil: Black (`#000000`) | Highlight: White (`#FFFFFF`) (top-left) | Realistic iris gradient (darker center, lighter edges).                        |\n| **Eyebrows**          | Dark Gray (`#4D4D4D`) | Gradient: Lighter tips            | Thick, arched; gradient for texture.                                          |\n| **Nose/Mouth**        | Nose: Beige (`#E0C0A8`)<br>Mouth: Brown (`#B38066`) | Nose: Darker top<br>Mouth: Shadow (`#99664D`) under lower lip | Nose uses a vertical gradient (darker at top, lighter at tip).                 |\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe composition is **tightly cropped** to focus on the face, with precise proportional relationships:\n\n### ViewBox and Frame\nAssume a **1000x1000px square viewBox** for scalability (adjustable for 16:9 ratios, but the portrait is centered). Key coordinates:\n\n| Element               | Vertical Range (y-axis) | Horizontal Range (x-axis) | Proportional Notes                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| **Head**              | `y=100` (top of hair) → `y=900` (bottom of collar) | `x=200` → `x=800` (face width) | Occupies 80% of vertical space; face centered horizontally. |\n| **Collar**            | `y=700` (top) → `y=900` (bottom) | `x=150` → `x=850`          | Extends 50px beyond the face on both sides; frames the beard. |\n| **Beard**             | `y=550` (top, under nose) → `y=900` (bottom) | `x=250` → `x=750`          | Covers the entire jaw/chin; curls more pronounced at the bottom. |\n| **Eyes**              | `y=350` (center)        | Left: `x=350` → `x=400`<br>Right: `x=600` → `x=650` | Each eye is 50px wide, 30px tall; centered horizontally. |\n\n### Lighting\nThe **main light source is front-left**, casting subtle shadows:\n- Under the eyebrows (downward on eyelids).\n- Under the nose (between nose and upper lip).\n- Under the chin (from the beard).\n- On the **right side** of the nose, cheek, and collar (due to left-lighting).\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe portrait follows **Renaissance/Baroque conventions** (c. 17th century) with:\n- **Sfumato**: Soft, gradual gradients (e.g., background, skin) to create depth.\n- **Realism**: Detailed facial anatomy (wrinkles, bone structure) and texture (hair, beard).\n- **Composition**: Close-up cropping to emphasize the subject’s expression; the spotlight background directs focus to the face.\n- **Color Palette**: Muted, earthy tones (green background, dark garment, white collar) typical of 17th-century portraiture.\n\n\n## 5. Technical Specifications for SVG\nTo recreate the image accurately, the SVG must adhere to **strict layering, path coordinates, and gradient definitions**. Below are key technical details:\n\n### ViewBox\nUse a **1000x1000px square viewBox** for consistency:  \n`<svg viewBox=\"0 0 1000 1000\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">`\n\n### Layering Order (Bottom to Top)\n1. **Background** (full-frame rectangle with radial gradient).  \n2. **Dark Garment** (covers lower third of the frame).  \n3. **Collar** (frames the beard/neck; sits on top of the garment).  \n4. **Face** (base skin layer; sits on top of the collar).  \n5. **Hair** (covers the top of the head; sits on top of the face).  \n6. **Beard** (covers the lower face; sits on top of the face and collar).  \n7. **Facial Features** (eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows; sits on top of all layers).  \n\n### Key Paths and Gradients\n#### Background (Spotlight Effect)\nA full-frame rectangle with a radial gradient centered on the face:  \n```svg\n<radialGradient id=\"bg-gradient\" cx=\"0.5\" cy=\"0.5\" r=\"0.5\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#8F9779\"/> <!-- Light center -->\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#3D4231\"/> <!-- Dark edges -->\n</radialGradient>\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" fill=\"url(#bg-gradient)\"/>\n```\n\n#### Dark Garment\nCovers the lower neck/chest, sitting under the collar:  \n```svg\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"800\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" fill=\"#1A1A1A\"/>\n```\n\n#### Collar (Folded White Linen)\nA wide, curved path with a vertical gradient to simulate fold shadows:  \n```svg\n<linearGradient id=\"collar-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\"/> <!-- Top (light) -->\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#CCCCCC\"/> <!-- Bottom (shadow) -->\n</linearGradient>\n<path d=\"M150 700 Q200 750 800 750 Q850 700 850 900 Q500 850 150 900 Z\" fill=\"url(#collar-gradient)\"/>\n```\n- **Path Notes**: The `Q` (quadratic bezier) curves create the folded \"flare\" of the collar. Adjust control points to match the original’s shape.\n\n#### Face (Base Skin Layer)\nA rounded rectangle with a linear gradient for skin tone:  \n```svg\n<linearGradient id=\"skin-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"1\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#F0D8C8\"/> <!-- Light (forehead) -->\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#E0C0A8\"/> <!-- Dark (jaw) -->\n</linearGradient>\n<path d=\"M200 300 Q500 250 800 300 Q500 900 200 900 Z\" fill=\"url(#skin-gradient)\"/>\n```\n- **Path Notes**: The top curve (`Q500 250`) creates the high forehead; the bottom curve (`Q500 900`) follows the jawline.\n\n#### Hair (Short, Wavy Gray)\nGroup multiple small, wavy paths to simulate texture. Example for the left side:  \n```svg\n<g id=\"hair\">\n  <path d=\"M200 100 Q250 150 300 120 Q350 100 400 130\" fill=\"#666666\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Add 10–15 more wavy paths across x=200–800, y=100–300 -->\n</g>\n```\n- **Texture Tip**: Use thin white strokes (`stroke=\"#FFFFFF\"`) on selected paths to simulate highlights.\n\n#### Beard (Full, Curly Gray)\nGroup multiple curly paths to create volume. Example for the bottom curl:  \n```svg\n<g id=\"beard\">\n  <path d=\"M500 700 Q550 750 500 800 Q450 750 500 700\" fill=\"#666666\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Add 20–30 more curly paths across x=250–750, y=550–900 -->\n</g>\n```\n- **Curl Tip**: Use closed `Q` curves (e.g., loops) for the most pronounced curls at the bottom of the beard.\n\n#### Facial Features (Eyes, Nose, Mouth)\n##### Eyes\nOval paths with iris gradients and a white highlight:  \n```svg\n<g id=\"eyes\">\n  <!-- Left Eye -->\n  <ellipse cx=\"375\" cy=\"350\" rx=\"25\" ry=\"15\" fill=\"#4D3319\"/> <!-- Iris -->\n  <circle cx=\"375\" cy=\"350\" r=\"8\" fill=\"#000000\"/> <!-- Pupil -->\n  <circle cx=\"385\" cy=\"345\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/> <!-- Highlight -->\n  <!-- Right Eye (mirror left) -->\n  <ellipse cx=\"625\" cy=\"350\" rx=\"25\" ry=\"15\" fill=\"#4D3319\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"625\" cy=\"350\" r=\"8\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"615\" cy=\"345\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n</g>\n```\n\n##### Eyebrows\nThick, arched paths with a gradient for texture:  \n```svg\n<g id=\"eyebrows\">\n  <!-- Left Eyebrow -->\n  <path d=\"M320 320 Q350 310 400 320\" fill=\"#4D4D4D\" stroke=\"#666666\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n  <!-- Right Eyebrow (mirror left) -->\n  <path d=\"M600 320 Q650 310 680 320\" fill=\"#4D4D4D\" stroke=\"#666666\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n</g>\n```\n\n##### Nose\nA curved path with a vertical gradient to show the bridge and tip:  \n```svg\n<linearGradient id=\"nose-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#E0C0A8\"/> <!-- Dark (top) -->\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#F0D8C8\"/> <!-- Light (tip) -->\n</linearGradient>\n<path d=\"M475 400 Q500 450 525 400 Q500 550 475 550\" fill=\"url(#nose-gradient)\"/>\n```\n\n##### Mouth\nA straight line with a gradient for upper/lower lip definition:  \n```svg\n<linearGradient id=\"mouth-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">\n  <stop offset=\"0%\" stop-color=\"#B38066\"/> <!-- Upper lip (dark) -->\n  <stop offset=\"100%\" stop-color=\"#99664D\"/> <!-- Lower lip (shadow) -->\n</linearGradient>\n<path d=\"M425 570 Q500 575 575 570\" fill=\"url(#mouth-gradient)\"/>\n```\n\n\n## 6. Critical Notes for SVG Accuracy\n1. **Layering**: Strictly follow the bottom-to-top order (background → garment → collar → face → hair → beard → features) to avoid rendering errors.  \n2. **Textures**: Use **multiple small paths** for hair/beard texture (not patterns) to maintain control over highlights.  \n3. **Gradients**: Subtlety is key—avoid harsh color transitions. Use low-opacity gradients for shadows/wrinkles.  \n4. **Precision**: Match path coordinates to the proportional measurements (e.g., eye position at `x=375/625`, `y=350`) for facial symmetry.  \n5. **Masks**: Use `<mask>` elements for fine details like forehead wrinkles (e.g., a low-opacity dark path over the skin layer).  \n\nBy adhering to these specifications, the SVG will faithfully reproduce the original portrait’s **style, proportion, and detail**.",
  "v1_205": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this 19th-century military portrait, the following detailed breakdown of **geometric shapes, tonal values, spatial relationships, and textural properties** is essential. The image is a high-contrast grayscale photograph (likely a daguerreotype or tintype) with a centered subject, formal composition, and pronounced vignetting.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe primary subject is a person in a **U.S. Civil War-era military uniform**, with the following key components (listed from top to bottom):\n\n#### **A. Kepi (Military Hat)**\n- **Crown**: A rounded, dome-like shape (semicircular in profile) with a flat top edge. The crown is slightly wider than the brim.\n- **Brim**: A short, horizontal band (rectangular with rounded edges) that extends 0.5–1 inch beyond the crown’s front and sides. It rests just above the subject’s eyebrows.\n- **Hat Band**: A narrow, horizontal strip (1/4 inch thick) that encircles the base of the crown, sitting between the crown and brim. A small, circular **emblem** (likely a regimental or national insignia, e.g., a U.S. Army eagle) is centered on the front of the band.\n- **Chin Strap**: A thin, curved band that runs from the left and right sides of the hat band, crossing at the front of the brim. It fastens with a small button at the center of the brim (below the emblem).\n\n#### **B. Facial Hair**\n- **Mustache**: A thick, curved shape that covers the upper lip, extending from the corners of the mouth to the nose. The ends curve slightly downward.\n- **Beard**: A full, dense shape that covers the chin and cheeks, connecting to the sideburns. The beard is rounded at the bottom and tapers slightly toward the jawline.\n- **Sideburns**: Curly, bushy strands that frame the temples, merging with the beard.\n\n#### **C. Uniform Jacket**\nA **double-breasted frock coat** with a high collar, wide lapels, and epaulettes. Key features:\n- **Lapels**: Two wide, angled flaps (each ~2 inches wide) that overlap at the center of the chest. The left lapel (viewer’s right) is topmost, covering part of the right lapel.\n- **Buttons**: Two visible round buttons on the left lapel, aligned vertically (one at the mid-chest, one at the waist). A third button is partially hidden under the lapel at the collar.\n- **Collar**: A high, upright band (1–1.5 inches tall) that encircles the neck, with a small gap at the front revealing the cravat.\n- **Epaulettes**: Symmetrical, oval-shaped decorations on both shoulders. Each epaulette has 3–4 vertical **rank stripes** (chevrons) running parallel to the shoulder seam.\n- **Sleeves**: Straight, tailored sleeves with a slight taper toward the wrists. The cuffs are not visible.\n\n#### **D. Cravat (Neckwear)**\nA light-colored, bowtie-like shape visible under the collar. It is narrow (1 inch wide) and centered at the front of the neck.\n\n#### **E. Background**\nA plain, gradient-filled rectangle that frames the subject. The background is dominated by a **radial vignetting effect** (light in the center, dark at the edges).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is **grayscale**, with tonal values ranging from pure white (lightest areas) to deep black (darkest areas). Key tonal assignments:\n- **Uniform Jacket**: Dark gray (near-black) with subtle mid-gray gradients to mimic folds and shadow. The lapels and epaulettes are slightly lighter than the main jacket body.\n- **Kepi**: Dark gray (matching the jacket) with a mid-gray brim and a light gray emblem.\n- **Facial Hair**: Medium gray (darker than the face) with a textured, \"fuzzy\" appearance (achieved via small, closely spaced lines or dots in SVG).\n- **Face/Neck**: Light gray (pale skin tone) with mid-gray shadows on the cheeks, jawline, and under the hat brim.\n- **Cravat**: Very light gray (near-white) to contrast with the dark collar.\n- **Background**: Radial gradient from light gray (center) to dark gray (corners). The center is brightest at the subject’s face, fading to black at the edges.\n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Uniform**: Matte, wool-like texture—replicated in SVG using solid fills with linear gradients for depth.\n- **Facial Hair**: Dense, curly texture—achieved with a **pattern fill** (small, overlapping arcs or a noise filter) to mimic hair strands.\n- **Kepi**: Smooth, leather-like texture—solid fill with a subtle radial gradient for the crown.\n- **Background**: Flat, even texture—solid fill with a radial gradient for vignetting.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **centered and symmetrical**, with the subject occupying 80% of the image height. Key proportional and positional details:\n- **Head/Hat**: The head (including the kepi) takes up the top 1/3 of the image. The kepi’s crown is 1/4 the height of the head, with the brim resting 1 inch above the eyebrows.\n- **Facial Hair**: The mustache covers 2/3 of the upper lip, extending 0.5 inches beyond the mouth corners. The beard spans from the bottom of the mustache to the Adam’s apple, widening to cover the cheeks.\n- **Jacket**: The jacket covers the lower 2/3 of the image. The lapels overlap at the center, with the left lapel (viewer’s right) extending 1 inch past the midline. Buttons are spaced 2 inches apart vertically.\n- **Epaulettes**: Positioned 1 inch from the top of the shoulders, extending 0.5 inches beyond the jacket’s edge. The rank stripes are 0.25 inches wide and spaced 0.1 inches apart.\n- **Vignetting**: The radial gradient’s center is aligned with the subject’s nose, with a radius equal to 70% of the image width. The gradient transitions from light gray (stop at 0%) to dark gray (stop at 100%).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Era**: 19th-century military portraiture (c. 1860s), typical of Civil War-era daguerreotypes.\n- **Composition**: Formal, posed, and symmetrical—designed to emphasize the subject’s rank and authority.\n- **Contrast**: High contrast between the dark uniform and light face/neck, drawing attention to the subject’s features.\n- **Vignetting**: A classic portrait technique to isolate the subject and create a \"spotlight\" effect.\n- **Texture**: The SVG must replicate the photo’s **grainy, vintage quality**—achieved via subtle noise filters or pattern fills for facial hair and the background.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Hat Emblem**: A small, circular symbol (1/4 inch diameter) centered on the kepi’s front band. Likely a **U.S. Army eagle** (though indistinct in the photo), but simplified to a light gray circle with a dark gray outline for SVG.\n- **Rank Stripes**: 3–4 vertical chevrons on each epaulette. Each stripe is 0.25 inches wide and 1 inch tall, spaced 0.1 inches apart.\n- **Buttons**: Two visible round buttons on the jacket’s left lapel (viewer’s right). Each button is 0.3 inches in diameter, with a light gray center and dark gray outline.\n- **Collar Gap**: A 0.5-inch opening at the front of the collar, revealing the cravat.\n\n\n### **SVG Technical Specifications**\nTo accurately reproduce the image, use the following SVG elements and properties:\n- **Clipping Path**: A path around the subject (head, jacket, epaulettes) to separate it from the background.\n- **Gradients**:\n  - **Background**: `<radialGradient>` from `#f0f0f0` (center) to `#000000` (corners).\n  - **Jacket**: `<linearGradient>` from `#333333` (light) to `#000000` (dark) along the vertical axis.\n  - **Face**: `<linearGradient>` from `#cccccc` (light) to `#999999` (dark) for shadows.\n- **Patterns**:\n  - **Facial Hair**: `<pattern>` with small, curved lines (`<path>` elements) to mimic curly hair.\n  - **Epaulette Stripes**: `<pattern>` with vertical rectangles for rank chevrons.\n- **Symbols**:\n  - **Hat Emblem**: `<circle>` with a `<path>` for the eagle (simplified).\n  - **Buttons**: `<circle>` with a `<radialGradient>` for a 3D effect.\n\n\n### **Summary of Key Proportions**\n| Element               | Proportion (Relative to Image Height) |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Total Image Height    | 100%                                   |\n| Head (Including Hat)  | 33%                                    |\n| Jacket                | 67%                                    |\n| Epaulette Height      | 10% of Shoulder Width                  |\n| Button Diameter       | 3% of Jacket Width                     |\n| Vignetting Radius     | 70% of Image Width                     |\n\n\nBy adhering to these details—especially the tonal gradients, facial hair texture, and symmetrical epaulettes—the SVG will accurately replicate the 19th-century military portrait’s formal, authoritative mood and vintage aesthetic.",

The crest is 50mm in diameter (12.5% of the jersey’s width).  \n- **Adidas Logo**: 3 black stripes on the left shoulder (player’s left), 10mm apart, running from the collar to the sleeve.  \n\n#### Armbands:\n- **Left Sleeve (Player’s Left)**: World Cup patch (25mm x 25mm) sewn 10mm above the cuff. The patch is aligned with the sleeve’s center.  \n- **Right Sleeve (Player’s Right)**: \"Save the Planet\" armband (100mm x 25mm) wrapped around the sleeve, 15mm above the cuff. The text is centered vertically and horizontally.  \n\n#### Shorts:\n- **Side Stripes**: 5mm wide, running from the hip (10mm below the waist) to the knee (10mm above the hem).  \n- **Number 10**: Centered on the left thigh (player’s left), 30mm tall (15% of the shorts’ height).  \n\n#### Tattoo:\n- **Left Forearm**: The lotus flower is centered 20mm below the elbow, with petals extending 15mm outward. The vines wrap around the forearm toward the wrist.  \n\n#### Background:\n- **Purple Stripes**: 4 diagonal stripes (45° angle) spanning the top 2/3 of the image. The widest stripe is 100mm (left side), narrowing to 50mm (right side).  \n- **Teal Rectangles**: 3 vertical rectangles on the right side (200mm tall, 50mm wide), spaced 20mm apart.  \n- **Distant Figures**: 5 gray silhouettes in the background (2 left, 3 right), 50–100mm tall, 20–30mm wide.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe original image is a **high-resolution photograph** with a shallow depth of field (bokeh background). For SVG, the style should balance:  \n- **Vector Precision**: Geometric shapes for stripes, numbers, and symbols (e.g., the Argentina crest as a circle with a sun, laurel branches, and text).  \n- **Photographic Cues**: Gradients to simulate fabric texture (e.g., jersey stripes with subtle light/dark gradients for depth) and blur (e.g., background elements with Gaussian blur filters).  \n- **Dynamic Pose**: The player’s arms are extended at 45° angles (left arm higher than right), with hands open (palms facing forward). The left leg is forward (knee straight), right leg bent (knee at 90°).  \n\n#### Key Stylistic Adjustments for SVG:\n- **Bokeh Background**: Use soft-edged rectangles with linear gradients (purple → transparent, teal → transparent) to mimic blur.  \n- **Fabric Texture**: Add a subtle radial gradient to the jersey (lighter in the center, darker at the edges) to simulate light reflection.  \n- **Skin Tone**: Use a linear gradient (light tan → darker tan) on the forearms and face to add depth.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text and symbols are **vector-based** and must be reproduced exactly for accuracy:  \n\n#### Text:\n- **Jersey Number**: \"10\" (black, bold sans-serif) on the chest and left thigh.  \n- **Armband**: \"SAVE THE PLANET\" (white, uppercase sans-serif) on the right sleeve. The font is condensed, with 2mm letter spacing.  \n- **World Cup Patch**: \"FIFA WORLD CUP QATAR 2022\" (white, uppercase sans-serif) around the trophy in the left sleeve patch. The text is curved to follow the patch’s perimeter.  \n\n#### Symbols:\n- **Argentina Crest**: A circular symbol with:  \n  - **Sun of May**: 16 golden rays (12 straight, 4 wavy) emanating from a blue circle.  \n  - **Laurel Branches**: Green branches on either side of the circle.  \n  - **Text**: \"REPÚBLICA ARGENTINA\" (white) around the circle’s edge.  \n- **FIFA World Cup Patch**: A purple square with a gold trophy (the FIFA World Cup) in the center. The trophy has a spherical top, cylindrical body, and a rectangular base.  \n- **Adidas Logo**: 3 black parallel stripes on the left shoulder (player’s left), 10mm apart.  \n\n#### Specific Details:\n- **Sweat**: 3 small white (#FFFFFF) droplets on the forehead (1mm diameter) and upper lip (0.5mm diameter).  \n- **Jersey Fabric**: Subtle wrinkles on the sleeves (1mm wide, gray #808080) to simulate movement.  \n- **Cuff Trim**: Black ribbed trim on the collar and cuffs (5mm wide) with a 1mm white stitch line.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Reproduction**\nTo recreate this image as an SVG, focus on:  \n- **Vector Shapes**: Use rectangles for stripes, circles for the crest, and paths for the tattoo/face.  \n- **Color Accuracy**: Match hex codes exactly (e.g., #74B9FF for jersey blue, #6C3483 for background purple).  \n- **Positioning**: Follow the spatial relationships (e.g., stripe proportions, number/crest placement) to maintain fidelity.  \n- **Stylization**: Use gradients for texture (fabric, skin) and blur filters for the background to mimic the photographic style.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the original image’s composition, color, and key elements.",

  "v1_21": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, technical description of its components, focusing on geometry, proportions, and spatial relationships. The image is a **top-down (aerial) photograph** of a brick-paved parking lot with three parked cars and numbered spaces, taken under soft natural lighting (likely overcast or late afternoon).\n\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe primary elements are:  \n- A **brick-paved parking lot** with a herringbone-like pattern (rectangular bricks laid in a staggered, diagonal grid).  \n- **Three parked cars**: A blue sedan (foreground), a red sedan (adjacent to the blue car), and a partial black car (rear-only, behind the red car).  \n- **White painted parking lines** defining rectangular spaces.  \n- **Parking space numbers** (white, bold sans-serif) in the center of each space.  \n- Minor details: A circular manhole cover, brick stains, and faint tire marks.\n\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n#### Brick Pavement\n- **Base Color**: Muted gray-brown (RGB ~#8B7E70), with subtle variation (lighter #A09486 and darker #706458) for depth.  \n- **Texture**: Rough, porous surface with visible mortar lines (thin, lighter gray #D0C8C0).  \n- **Stains/Dirt**: Irregular dark patches (#504840) between cars and along lines; a faint white oil stain near the blue car’s rear.  \n\n#### White Parking Lines\n- **Color**: Bright white (#FFFFFF), with subtle fading/chipping (#E0E0E0) along edges.  \n- **Width**: Consistent ~5cm (relative to brick size; 1 brick = ~20cm x 10cm).  \n- **Shape**: Straight lines forming rectangular spaces; lines are parallel to the cars’ sides (angle detailed in *Spatial Relationships*).  \n\n#### Cars\n- **Blue Sedan**:  \n  - **Body**: Glossy deep blue (#1A365D), with a slight metallic sheen (highlights #2D4A73, shadows #0D1E33).  \n  - **Windows**: Tinted dark gray (#202020), with faint reflection of the sky (#80A0C0).  \n  - **Wheels**: Silver alloy (five-spoke, #C0C0C0), tires black (#000000).  \n  - **Details**: Circular headlights (#FFFFFF) with clear lenses, rectangular grille (#000000), side mirrors (#000000), and a faint license plate (#FFFFFF) at the front.  \n- **Red Sedan**:  \n  - **Body**: Glossy red (#D92B2B), metallic sheen (highlights #E64A4A, shadows #801515).  \n  - **Windows/Wheels/Details**: Identical to the blue car (tinted windows, silver alloy wheels, black mirrors).  \n- **Black Car (Partial)**:  \n  - **Body**: Matte black (#000000), with a red tail light (#FF0000) and faint trunk line.  \n\n#### Numbers\n- **Color**: White (#FFFFFF), matching the parking lines.  \n- **Font**: Bold sans-serif (e.g., Arial Black), ~30cm tall (relative to bricks).  \n- **Orientation**: Rotated 180° (upside-down and reversed) to be readable by drivers entering the space.  \n\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe image is a **top-down aerial view** with the following key orientations:  \n- **Parking Spaces**: Rectangles oriented at a **30° angle from the image’s vertical axis** (i.e., their long sides run from the top-left to bottom-right of the frame).  \n- **Car Placement**:  \n  - **Blue Sedan**: Parked in the leftmost occupied space, with its front end pointing to the **bottom-right corner** of the image. The car occupies ~90% of the space (front bumper near the space’s front line, rear near the back line).  \n  - **Red Sedan**: Parked in the adjacent space to the **right** of the blue car, aligned identically (front end to bottom-right). The red car’s left side is ~10cm from the blue car’s right side.  \n  - **Black Car**: Partial view behind the red car (only the rear 1/3 is visible), aligned with the red car’s orientation.  \n- **Manhole Cover**: Circular, ~30cm diameter, located **1.5m to the right of the blue car’s rear wheel** (between the blue and red cars).  \n- **Numbers**: Centered in each space, ~50cm from the front and back lines. The blue car covers its space’s number; the red car partially covers its number (only the top half is visible).  \n\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Perspective**: Strict top-down (orthographic) view, with no foreshortening (critical for SVG accuracy).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused natural light (no harsh shadows), indicating an overcast day or late afternoon. Highlights on the cars are subtle (glossy reflections) and consistent with light coming from the **top-left** of the frame.  \n- **Realism**: Documentary-style realism with attention to texture (brick roughness, car gloss) and minor imperfections (stains, faded lines).  \n- **Composition**: Balanced between the vibrant cars (foreground) and neutral brick background (background), with the parking lines guiding the viewer’s eye from the left (empty spaces) to the right (occupied spaces).  \n\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Parking Numbers**:  \n  - **Content**: Sequential numbers (34, 33, 32, 31, 30) from left to right (each space has a unique number).  \n  - **Orientation**: Rotated 180° (upside-down and reversed) so they are readable by drivers entering the space. For example, the number “34” appears as “43” in the image (mirrored and upside-down).  \n  - **Position**: Centered in each space, ~30cm tall (relative to bricks).  \n- **Minor Details**:  \n  - **Chipped Lines**: Small gaps (~1-2cm) in the white lines, particularly near the blue car’s front.  \n  - **Tire Marks**: Faint black smudges (#000000) along the blue car’s left side (from entering the space).  \n  - **Car Interiors**: Faint view of the blue car’s interior (gray seats, #808080) through the front window.  \n\n\n### 6. Critical Geometric Details for SVG Reproduction\nTo ensure accurate SVG reconstruction, the following proportions and measurements (relative to a **standard sedan**) are essential:  \n- **Car Dimensions**:  \n  - Blue/Red Sedans: 4.5m long × 1.8m wide × 1.5m tall (standard mid-size sedan).  \n  - Black Car: Partial view (rear 1/3 = 1.5m long).  \n- **Parking Space Dimensions**:  \n  - Length: 5m (accommodates the 4.5m car with 25cm clearance front/back).  \n  - Width: 2.5m (accommodates the 1.8m car with 35cm clearance left/right).  \n- **Brick Dimensions**:  \n  - Standard rectangular brick: 20cm × 10cm × 5cm (laid in a running bond pattern, offset by 10cm per row).  \n  - Brick Pattern: Herringbone-like (each row is offset by 10cm, with bricks laid at a **45° angle** to the image’s frame—critical for the “diagonal” brick look).  \n- **Line Width**: 5cm (consistent for all parking lines).  \n\n\n### Summary for SVG Reconstruction\nThe SVG must prioritize **orthographic perspective** (top-down) and **geometric accuracy** (car dimensions, space proportions, brick pattern). Key layers include:  \n1. **Brick Pavement**: A grid of rectangles (20cm × 10cm) in a running bond pattern, with color variation and stains.  \n2. **Parking Lines**: 5cm-wide white rectangles, aligned at 30° from the vertical, defining 5m × 2.5m spaces.  \n3. **Cars**: Paths for the blue and red sedans (using bezier curves for rounded edges), with layers for body, windows, wheels, and details.  \n4. **Numbers**: Text elements rotated 180°, centered in each space.  \n5. **Minor Details**: Circle for the manhole cover, rectangles for stains, and lines for tire marks.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s realism and spatial relationships.",

  "v1_211": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its structure, elements, and visual properties. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **horizontal grouped bar chart** comparing spending on six consumer goods categories across four countries. Key elements include:  \n- **Chart Container**: A rectangular border framing the entire chart.  \n- **Title**: \"Amount spent on consumer goods\" at the top.  \n- **Vertical Category Axis**: Lists six categories on the left: *Photographic film*, *Toys*, *CDs*, *Perfumes*, *Tennis racquets*, *Personal stereos*.  \n- **Horizontal Value Axis**: Displays spending values (130–175 thousand pounds sterling) at the bottom, with tick marks at 5-unit increments.  \n- **Bars**: Four horizontal bars per category (one per country), stacked vertically within each category.  \n- **Legend**: A color-coded key at the bottom indicating country-bar mappings: *Britain* (yellow), *France* (dark gray), *Italy* (orange), *Germany* (blue).  \n- **X-Axis Title**: \"Spending in Thousand Pound Sterling\" at the bottom center.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **flat, solid colors** (no gradients or shadows) for a minimalistic, readable design.  \n\n| Element                | Color (Hex)       | Description                                  |\n|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Chart Border           | `#e0e0e0`         | Thin (1px) light gray stroke.                |\n| Title/Text             | `#333333`         | Dark gray sans-serif font (high contrast).   |\n| Britain (Bars)         | `#ffd700`         | Bright yellow (most prominent).              |\n| France (Bars)          | `#444444`         | Dark gray (second most prominent).           |\n| Italy (Bars)           | `#ff8c00`         | Orange (medium contrast).                    |\n| Germany (Bars)         | `#1e90ff`         | Light blue (lowest contrast).                |\n| Background             | `#ffffff`         | White (clean, neutral backdrop).             |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe chart uses a **grid-based layout** with precise margins and alignments. Below are key positional details (assuming an SVG viewbox of `0 0 800 600` for scalability):  \n\n#### **Overall Container**  \n- **Size**: 100% width/height of the SVG (viewbox: `0 0 800 600`).  \n- **Border**: Thin (`1px`) light gray (`#e0e0e0`) stroke around the entire container.  \n\n#### **Title**  \n- **Text**: \"Amount spent on consumer goods\" (sans-serif, `16px`).  \n- **Position**: Centered at the top, `5%` from the top edge (`y=30px` for 600px height).  \n- **Alignment**: `text-anchor=\"middle\"`.  \n\n#### **Vertical Category Axis (Left)**  \n- **Categories**: Six items listed in order (top-to-bottom: *Photographic film* → *Personal stereos*).  \n- **Text**: Sans-serif, `12px`, `#333333`.  \n- **Position**: Left-aligned, `1.25%` from the left edge (`x=10px` for 800px width).  \n- **Vertical Spacing**: Each category group occupies `14%` of the chart height (`84px` for 600px height). The first group starts at `15%` from the top (`y=90px`).  \n\n#### **Horizontal Value Axis (Bottom)**  \n- **Values**: 130–175 (increments of 5).  \n- **Tick Marks**: Short (`2px`) vertical lines extending up from the axis, aligned with each value.  \n- **Labels**: Sans-serif, `12px`, `#333333`, centered below each tick mark.  \n- **Position**: The axis spans `80%` of the chart width (`15%` to `95%` from the left edge: `x=120px` to `x=760px` for 800px width).  \n- **Value Mapping**: Each unit (1 thousand pounds) corresponds to `~1.78%` of the axis width (`14.22px` for 800px width).  \n\n#### **Bars (Per Category)**  \n- **Structure**: Four bars per category, stacked vertically (top-to-bottom: Britain → France → Italy → Germany).  \n- **Size**: Each bar is `25%` of the category group height (`21px` for 84px group height).  \n- **Length**: Determined by the country’s spending value (starts at the left edge of the value axis (`x=120px`) and extends right). For example:  \n  - **Photographic film (Britain)**: Value = 175 → Length = `45 units × 14.22px = 640px` (`x=120px` to `x=760px`).  \n  - **Photographic film (Germany)**: Value = 145 → Length = `15 units × 14.22px = 213px` (`x=120px` to `x=333px`).  \n\n#### **Legend (Bottom, Above Value Axis)**  \n- **Items**: Four entries (Britain, France, Italy, Germany) with color-coded squares (`10x10px`).  \n- **Text**: Sans-serif, `10px`, `#333333`, baseline-aligned to the right of each square.  \n- **Position**: Left-aligned, `15%` from the left edge (`x=120px` for 800px width), `91.7%` from the top (`y=550px` for 600px height).  \n- **Spacing**: Items spaced `50px` apart horizontally.  \n\n#### **X-Axis Title**  \n- **Text**: \"Spending in Thousand Pound Sterling\" (sans-serif, `12px`, `#333333`).  \n- **Position**: Centered at the bottom, `98.3%` from the top (`y=590px` for 600px height).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Design**: **Flat, minimalistic** (no gradients, shadows, or 3D effects).  \n- **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial/Helvetica) for all text (clean, readable).  \n- **Contrast**: High (white background + dark gray text + vibrant bar colors).  \n- **Layout**: Logical and hierarchical (title → categories → bars → legend → axis title).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n- **Text**:  \n  - **Title**: \"Amount spent on consumer goods\" (centered, `16px`).  \n  - **Categories**: Left-aligned, `12px`, `#333333`.  \n  - **Value Axis**: Centered labels, `12px`, `#333333`.  \n  - **Legend**: `10px` text, aligned to color squares.  \n  - **X-Axis Title**: \"Spending in Thousand Pound Sterling\" (centered, `12px`).  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - **Legend Squares**: `10x10px` solid rectangles (matching bar colors).  \n  - **Tick Marks**: `2px` vertical lines (value axis).  \n- **Key Values (Per Category/Country)**:  \n  | Category           | Britain (Yellow) | France (Dark Gray) | Italy (Orange) | Germany (Blue) |\n  |--------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|\n  | Photographic film  | 175              | 165                | 155            | 145            |\n  | Toys               | 170              | 160                | 155            | 145            |\n  | CDs                | 170              | 160                | 150            | 145            |\n  | Perfumes           | 170              | 150                | 155            | 145            |\n  | Tennis racquets    | 170              | 150                | 155            | 145            |\n  | Personal stereos   | 170              | 150                | 150            | 145            |\n\n\n### **SVG Implementation Guidelines**  \nTo ensure scalability and accuracy, use the following:  \n\n#### **Viewbox**  \n- Set `viewBox=\"0 0 800 600\"` to maintain proportions.  \n\n#### **Bars**  \n- Use `<rect>` elements with:  \n  - `x`: Start at the left edge of the value axis (`120px`).  \n  - `y`: Top of the category group (e.g., `90px` for *Photographic film*).  \n  - `width`: Calculated as `(value - 130) × 14.22px` (e.g., `45 × 14.22 = 640px` for Britain’s 175).  \n  - `height`: `21px` (25% of the 84px category group height).  \n  - `fill`: Matching country color (e.g., `#ffd700` for Britain).  \n\n#### **Text**  \n- Use `<text>` elements with:  \n  - `font-family=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"`.  \n  - `font-size` and `fill` as specified.  \n  - `text-anchor` for alignment (e.g., `middle` for the title).  \n\n#### **Legend**  \n- Use `<rect>` for color squares (`10x10px`) and `<text>` for country names, aligned horizontally.  \n\n#### **Border**  \n- Use a `<rect>` with `stroke=\"#e0e0e0\"`, `stroke-width=\"1px\"`, and `fill=\"none\"` to frame the chart.  \n\n\n### **Example SVG Snippet (Photographic Film Group)**  \n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 800 600\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Chart Border -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" stroke=\"#e0e0e0\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\"/>\n\n  <!-- Title -->\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"30\" font-size=\"16px\" fill=\"#333333\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Amount spent on consumer goods</text>\n\n  <!-- Vertical Category Axis (Photographic Film) -->\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"132\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#333333\">Photographic film</text>\n\n  <!-- Horizontal Value Axis (Tick Marks/Labels) -->\n  <line x1=\"120\" y1=\"570\" x2=\"120\" y2=\"572\" stroke=\"#333333\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"120\" y=\"580\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#333333\" text-anchor=\"middle\">130</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for 135–175 -->\n\n  <!-- Bars (Photographic Film) -->\n  <!-- Britain (Yellow: 175) -->\n  <rect x=\"120\" y=\"90\" width=\"640\" height=\"21\" fill=\"#ffd700\"/>\n  <!-- France (Dark Gray: 165) -->\n  <rect x=\"120\" y=\"111\" width=\"497.77\" height=\"21\" fill=\"#444444\"/>\n  <!-- Italy (Orange: 155) -->\n  <rect x=\"120\" y=\"132\" width=\"355.55\" height=\"21\" fill=\"#ff8c00\"/>\n  <!-- Germany (Blue: 145) -->\n  <rect x=\"120\" y=\"153\" width=\"213.33\" height=\"21\" fill=\"#1e90ff\"/>\n\n  <!-- Legend -->\n  <rect x=\"120\" y=\"545\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" fill=\"#ffd700\"/>\n  <text x=\"132\" y=\"545\" font-size=\"10px\" fill=\"#333333\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Britain</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for France, Italy, Germany -->\n\n  <!-- X-Axis Title -->\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"590\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#333333\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Spending in Thousand Pound Sterling</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Summary**  \nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the chart as an SVG, including geometric proportions, color codes, text styles, and positional relationships.

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use flat, solid colors with no textures, adhering to a minimalist style.  \n\n| Element               | Color (Hex)       | Description                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Title text            | `#000080` (Dark Blue) | Bold, sans-serif, centered.                  |\n| Table border          | `#000000` (Black) | Solid 1px border around the entire table and between cells. |\n| Header cell background| `#D3D3D3` (Light Gray) | Distinguishes the header from data rows.     |\n| Data cell background  | `#FFFFFF` (White) | Plain white for readability.                 |\n| All text (table)      | `#000000` (Black) | Regular-weight sans-serif.                   |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **centered horizontally** for both the title and table, with a clear vertical hierarchy (title above table).  \n\n#### Title\n- **Position**: Centered at the top of the SVG.  \n- **Alignment**: Horizontally centered using `text-anchor=\"middle\"`.  \n- **Margin**: ~20px of vertical space between the title and the table (adjust based on font size).  \n\n#### Table\n- **Position**: Below the title, centered horizontally.  \n- **Dimensions**:  \n  - **Width**: 450px (sum of column widths: 150px + 80px + 100px + 120px).  \n  - **Height**: 210px (7 rows × 30px row height).  \n- **Column Widths**:  \n  - Column 1 (City): 150px (accommodates longer names like \"Washington DC\").  \n  - Column 2 (Date opened): 80px (fits 4-digit years).  \n  - Column 3 (Kilometres of route): 100px (fits 1–3-digit numbers).  \n  - Column 4 (Passengers per year): 120px (fits 3–4-digit numbers).  \n- **Row Height**: 30px (consistent for header and data rows).  \n- **Cell Padding**: 5px (space between text and cell borders, applied to all sides).  \n\n#### Text Alignment\nText alignment varies by column to optimize readability:  \n| Column               | Header Alignment | Data Alignment |\n|----------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| City                 | Left (`start`)   | Left (`start`) |\n| Date opened          | Center (`middle`) | Center (`middle`) |\n| Kilometres of route  | Left (`start`)   | Right (`end`)  |\n| Passengers per year  | Left (`start`)   | Right (`end`)  |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image follows a **minimalist, informational style** with:  \n- **Clean Borders**: Solid black borders around the table and between cells for clarity.  \n- **Contrast**: Gray header background vs. white data rows to separate labels from values.  \n- **Sans-Serif Fonts**: Arial (or a similar sans-serif font) for all text, with the title using a larger, bold weight to emphasize hierarchy.  \n- **No Decorative Elements**: No shadows, gradients, or icons—focus is on data presentation.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### Title\n- **Content**: *\"Underground Railway Systems\"*.  \n- **Style**:  \n  - Font: Arial Bold (sans-serif).  \n  - Font Size: 16px (larger than table text).  \n  - Color: `#000080` (dark blue).  \n  - Position: Centered horizontally using `text-anchor=\"middle\"`.  \n\n#### Table Text\n- **Header Text**:  \n  - Content: *\"City\"*, *\"Date opened\"*, *\"Kilometres of route\"*, *\"Passengers per year (in millions)\"*.  \n  - Style: Arial Regular, 12px, black (`#000000`).  \n- **Data Text**:  \n  - Content: City names (e.g., \"London\"), years (e.g., \"1863\"), distances (e.g., \"394\"), and passenger counts (e.g., \"775\").  \n  - Style: Arial Regular, 12px, black (`#000000`).  \n\n\n### **SVG Implementation Details**\nTo recreate the image, use SVG elements (`<text>`, `<rect>`) and transforms to enforce layout. Below is a breakdown of key SVG attributes:  \n\n#### Viewport\nSet the SVG viewport to contain the title and table without cropping:  \n```svg\n<svg width=\"450\" height=\"250\" viewBox=\"0 0 450 250\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n```\n\n#### Title\nCenter the title horizontally and position it 20px from the top:  \n```svg\n<text \n  x=\"50%\" \n  y=\"20px\" \n  text-anchor=\"middle\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"16px\" \n  font-weight=\"bold\" \n  fill=\"#000080\"\n>Underground Railway Systems</text>\n```\n\n#### Table Group\nCenter the table horizontally using a nested group. The outer group positions the table at 50% of the viewport width; the inner group translates it left by half the table width (225px) to center it:  \n```svg\n<g transform=\"translate(50%, 40px)\"> <!-- 40px margin from title -->\n  <g transform=\"translate(-225px, 0)\"> <!-- Center table (225px = 450px/2) -->\n    <!-- Table cells and text here -->\n  </g>\n</g>\n```\n\n#### Header Row (Gray Background)\nEach header cell is a `<rect>` with a gray fill and black border. Text is positioned using cell padding (5px) and alignment rules:  \n```svg\n<!-- Header Cell 1: City -->\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"150\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#D3D3D3\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"5px\" \n  y=\"19px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"start\"\n>City</text>\n\n<!-- Header Cell 2: Date opened -->\n<rect x=\"150\" y=\"0\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#D3D3D3\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"190px\" \n  y=\"19px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"middle\"\n>Date opened</text>\n\n<!-- Header Cell 3: Kilometres of route -->\n<rect x=\"230\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#D3D3D3\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"235px\" \n  y=\"19px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"start\"\n>Kilometres of route</text>\n\n<!-- Header Cell 4: Passengers per year (in millions) -->\n<rect x=\"330\" y=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#D3D3D3\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"335px\" \n  y=\"19px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"start\"\n>Passengers per year (in millions)</text>\n```\n\n#### Data Rows (White Background)\nData cells use a white fill and follow the same layout as header cells. Text is positioned using cell padding and alignment rules:  \n```svg\n<!-- Data Row 1: London -->\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"30\" width=\"150\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"5px\" \n  y=\"49px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"start\"\n>London</text>\n\n<rect x=\"150\" y=\"30\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"190px\" \n  y=\"49px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"middle\"\n>1863</text>\n\n<rect x=\"230\" y=\"30\" width=\"100\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"325px\" \n  y=\"49px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"end\"\n>394</text>\n\n<rect x=\"330\" y=\"30\" width=\"120\" height=\"30\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text \n  x=\"445px\" \n  y=\"49px\" \n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12px\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"end\"\n>775</text>\n```\n\nRepeat this pattern for the remaining 5 data rows (Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, Kyoto, Los Angeles), adjusting the `y` position by 30px per row (e.g., Paris = `y=60`, Tokyo = `y=90`, etc.).\n\n\n### **Summary of Key SVG Attributes**\n| Element               | Key Attributes                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Title                 | `text-anchor=\"middle\"`, `font-weight=\"bold\"`, `fill=\"#000080\"` |\n| Table Group           | `transform=\"translate(50%, 40px) translate(-225px, 0)\"` (centered) |\n| Cells                 | `stroke=\"#000000\"`, `stroke-width=\"1\"`, `fill` (gray/white) |\n| Text                  | `font-family=\"Arial\"`, `font-size=\"12px\"` (table), `16px` (title) |\n| Text Alignment        | `text-anchor` set to `start`, `middle`, or `end` per column |\n\n\n### **Final Notes**\n- **Responsiveness**: The SVG uses fixed dimensions (450px × 250px) to match the original image. For a responsive design, adjust the viewport and use relative units (e.g., `%`), but this is not required for a precise reproduction.  \n- **Font Fallbacks**: If Arial is unavailable, use a similar sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica) to maintain the minimalist style.  \n\nThis detailed breakdown provides all the geometric, stylistic, and layout information needed to recreate the image as an accurate SVG.",
  "v1_213": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its structure, elements, and styling. The image is a **statistical table** showing national consumer expenditure percentages by category for five countries in 2002. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe primary object is a **rectangular table** with a title, header row, and data rows. Key elements include:\n- **Title**: A single line of text above the table.\n- **Table Grid**: 6 rows (1 header + 5 data) × 4 columns. Columns are labeled:  \n  `Country`, `Food/Drinks/Tobacco`, `Clothing/Footwear`, `Leisure/Education`.\n- **Cells**: 24 rectangular cells (6 rows × 4 columns), each with a border.\n- **Text**: Title, header labels, and data (country names + percentages).\n\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n- **Background**: Solid white (no textures).\n- **Borders**: 1px solid black (uniform width, solid stroke).\n- **Text**: \n  - **Color**: Black (high contrast for readability).\n  - **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., `Arial`, `Helvetica`—standard for statistical tables).\n  - **Weight**: Bold for headers; regular for data.\n- **Cells**: White fill (no alternating row colors).\n\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe layout is **left-aligned** (title and table start at the same horizontal offset) with consistent margins. Below is a breakdown of dimensions and positions (relative to an SVG `viewBox=\"0 0 500 200\"` for scalability):\n\n| Element               | Position (x, y) | Dimensions (Width × Height) | Margins/Padding       |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Title**             | (10, 21.2)      | ~480px × 14px               | 10px from top/left    |\n| **Table**             | (10, 30)        | 470px × 150px               | 10px below title      |\n| **Header Row**        | (10, 30)        | 470px × 25px                | —                     |\n| **Data Rows**         | (10, 55/80/105/130/155) | 470px × 25px each | 0px between rows      |\n| **Cells**             | Varied (see below) | Column-specific widths × 25px | 5px left/right padding; vertical centering |\n\n#### Column Widths (Table)\nColumns are sized proportionally to their content (wider for longer headers):\n- **Column 1 (`Country`)**: 80px (fits shortest header/left-aligned text).\n- **Column 2 (`Food/Drinks/Tobacco`)**: 140px (longest header).\n- **Column 3 (`Clothing/Footwear`)**: 120px (medium-length header).\n- **Column 4 (`Leisure/Education`)**: 130px (medium-length header).\n\n#### Cell Positioning\nEach cell is defined by its **top-left corner** (x, y) and dimensions. For example:\n- **Header Cell 1 (`Country`)**: `x=10`, `y=30`, `width=80`, `height=25`.\n- **Data Cell (Ireland, `Food/Drinks/Tobacco`)**: `x=90`, `y=55`, `width=140`, `height=25`.\n\n#### Text Alignment\n- **Title**: Left-aligned (uses `text-anchor=\"start\"`).\n- **Headers**: Left-aligned (consistent with category labels).\n- **Data**: \n  - `Country` column: Left-aligned (text-anchor=\"start\").\n  - Percentage columns (2–4): **Right-aligned** (text-anchor=\"end\") for easier numerical comparison.\n\n#### Text Placement\nText is **vertically centered** in cells using the cell’s midpoint (e.g., a 25px-tall cell with 12px text has text positioned at `y = cell.y + 12.5`). Horizontal placement uses:\n- **Left-aligned text** (title, headers, `Country` column): `x = cell.x + 5px` (left padding).\n- **Right-aligned text** (percentages): `x = cell.x + cell.width - 5px` (right padding).\n\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Style**: **Minimalist/functional** (no decorative elements—focus on clarity).\n- **Borders**: Continuous grid (each cell has a border, creating a uniform table).\n- **Typography**: Sans-serif font (optimized for screen readability).\n- **Hierarchy**: Title (largest/bold), headers (bold), data (regular)—uses weight/size to distinguish sections.\n\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\nAll text is **exact** (no abbreviations) and follows standard statistical formatting:\n- **Title**: `Percentage of national consumer expenditure by category - 2002` (left-aligned, 14px bold).\n- **Headers**: \n  - `Country` (left-aligned, 12px bold).\n  - `Food/Drinks/Tobacco` (left-aligned, 12px bold).\n  - `Clothing/Footwear` (left-aligned, 12px bold).\n  - `Leisure/Education` (left-aligned, 12px bold).\n- **Data**:\n  - **Countries**: `Ireland`, `Italy`, `Spain`, `Sweden`, `Turkey` (left-aligned, 12px regular).\n  - **Percentages**: Two decimal places + `%` symbol (e.g., `28.91%`, `6.43%`—right-aligned, 12px regular).\n\n\n### Critical SVG Implementation Notes\nTo ensure accuracy, use these properties for SVG elements:\n- **Rectangles (Cells)**: Define with `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `stroke=\"black\"`, `stroke-width=\"1\"`, `fill=\"white\"`.\n- **Text**: \n  - Use `text-anchor` for alignment (`start` for left, `end` for right).\n  - Use `font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\"` for consistency.\n  - Vertically center text using the cell’s midpoint (e.g., `y = cell.y + 12.5` for 25px-tall cells).\n- **ViewBox**: Set to `0 0 500 200` to include all elements with margins.\n\n\n### Example SVG Code (Abbreviated)\nBelow is a snippet showing the title, header row, and one data row (Ireland). Repeat the data row structure for Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey (adjusting `y` for each row):\n\n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 500 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Title -->\n  <text \n    x=\"10\" y=\"21.2\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"14\" \n    font-weight=\"bold\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"start\"\n  >\n    Percentage of national consumer expenditure by category - 2002\n  </text>\n\n  <!-- Table Grid (Header Row) -->\n  <rect x=\"10\" y=\"30\" width=\"80\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n  <rect x=\"90\" y=\"30\" width=\"140\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n  <rect x=\"230\" y=\"30\" width=\"120\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n  <rect x=\"350\" y=\"30\" width=\"130\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\n  <!-- Header Text -->\n  <text \n    x=\"15\" y=\"42.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    font-weight=\"bold\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"start\"\n  >Country</text>\n  <text \n    x=\"95\" y=\"42.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    font-weight=\"bold\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"start\"\n  >Food/Drinks/Tobacco</text>\n  <text \n    x=\"235\" y=\"42.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    font-weight=\"bold\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"start\"\n  >Clothing/Footwear</text>\n  <text \n    x=\"355\" y=\"42.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    font-weight=\"bold\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"start\"\n  >Leisure/Education</text>\n\n  <!-- Data Row (Ireland) -->\n  <rect x=\"10\" y=\"55\" width=\"80\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n  <rect x=\"90\" y=\"55\" width=\"140\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n  <rect x=\"230\" y=\"55\" width=\"120\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n  <rect x=\"350\" y=\"55\" width=\"130\" height=\"25\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\n  <text \n    x=\"15\" y=\"67.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"start\"\n  >Ireland</text>\n  <text \n    x=\"225\" y=\"67.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"end\"\n  >28.91%</text>\n  <text \n    x=\"345\" y=\"67.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"end\"\n  >6.43%</text>\n  <text \n    x=\"475\" y=\"67.5\" \n    font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" \n    font-size=\"12\" \n    fill=\"black\" \n    text-anchor=\"end\"\n  >2.21%</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### Summary of Key Requirements for SVG\n- **Grid Consistency**: All cells must have 1px black borders and consistent dimensions.\n- **Text Alignment**: Critical for readability (right-align numbers, left-align labels).\n- **Font Consistency**: Use the same sans-serif font for all text (bold for headers).\n- **Positioning**: Precise x/y coordinates for all elements to maintain spatial relationships.\n- **Scalability**: Use a `viewBox` to ensure the SVG scales correctly.\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the table’s structure, style, and content.",
  "v1_214": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description covering all visual and structural elements:\n\n\n### **1. Overall Layout & Main Objects**\nThe image is a **2-row, 2-column grid of pie charts** (4 total), divided into two sections:  \n- **Top Section**: *\"Units Of electricity by fuel source in Australia\"* (note capital \"Of\")  \n  - Left: 1980 electricity production pie chart  \n  - Right: 2000 electricity production pie chart  \n- **Bottom Section**: *\"Units of electricity by fuel source in France\"* (note lowercase \"of\")  \n  - Left: 1980 electricity production pie chart  \n  - Right: 2000 electricity production pie chart  \n\nEach chart is contained within a **white rectangular box** (1px light gray border, `#E0E0E0`) with consistent spacing.

Positioned 30px below the circle.  \n    - Red (2 units): Leader line to a red square with \"2\". Positioned 10px right of the dark blue label.  \n  - **Legend (Right of Chart)**: Identical to the 1980 France legend.  \n  - Text:  \n    - \"2000\" (centered below circle, 14px bold).  \n    - \"Total Production: 180units\" (no space, centered below \"2000\", 12px).  \n\n\n### **4. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalist Data Visualization**: Focus on clarity with bold colors and simple shapes.  \n- **Hierarchy**: Large slices (major fuel sources) have prominent inside labels; tiny slices (minor sources) use outside labels with leader lines to avoid clutter.  \n- **Consistency**: France charts share a legend; Australia charts omit legends (assumed to be self-explanatory due to fewer slices).  \n- **Accuracy**: Slice angles are mathematically precise (e.g., 50 units = 180° for 100 total).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, & Specific Details**\n#### **Critical Text Details**\n- **Section Headers**:  \n  - Australia: \"Units Of electricity by fuel source in Australia\" (capital \"Of\").  \n  - France: \"Units of electricity by fuel source in France\" (lowercase \"of\").  \n- **Total Production**:  \n  - Australia 1980: \"Total Production: 100 units\" (space after 100).  \n  - Australia 2000: \"Total Production: 170 units\" (space after 170).  \n  - France 1980: \"Total Production: 90 units\" (space after 90).  \n  - France 2000: \"Total Production: 180units\" (**no space** after 180).  \n\n#### **Symbols**\n- **Leader Lines**: Used exclusively for tiny slices (2 units) to connect them to outside labels.  \n- **Color Squares**: 8x8px, matching slice colors, containing white text (e.g., \"2\" for 2 units).  \n\n#### **Edge Cases**\n- **Tiny Slices**: Angles are ~4° (too small for inside labels). Leader lines are 1px black, with a 90° turn to align labels horizontally.  \n- **Legend Placement**: France charts include legends to the right (100px wide) to explain 5 fuel sources; Australia charts omit legends (only 4 fuel sources, assumed to be intuitive).  \n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Notes for Recreation**\n- **Pie Slice Calculations**: Use `stroke` for slice borders (1px white) to separate adjacent slices.  \n- **Leader Lines**: Draw as `<line>` elements with `x1/y1` at the slice midpoint and `x2/y2` at the label square.  \n- **Color Squares**: Use `<rect>` elements (8x8px) with `rx=\"2\"` (rounded corners) for a modern look.  \n- **Text Alignment**: Use `text-anchor=\"middle\"` for centered text (e.g., chart titles, total production).  \n- **Responsiveness**: Set the SVG `viewBox` to `0 0 800 600` to maintain proportions on different screens.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as an SVG, including geometric precision, color values, and layout constraints.",
  "v1_215": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its components, focusing on geometry, proportions, patterns, and spatial relationships. The image is a **technical map** of Chorleywood village, illustrating development phases (1868–1994) and infrastructure.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe map is contained within a **1px black rectangular border** (landscape orientation, ~2:1 width-to-height ratio). Key elements include:  \n- **Infrastructure**: Main roads, motorway, railway, Chorleywood Station, roundabout.  \n- **Land Use**: Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, development zones (4 time periods).  \n- **Legend**: Icons and labels for infrastructure and development phases (bottom of the map).  \n\n#### **Infrastructure**\n- **Main Roads**: Thick (2px) black curved lines forming a network. Major paths:  \n  - A primary road curves from the **bottom-left** to the **center**, splitting to connect to the **roundabout** (top-right) and **Chorleywood Station** (center-left).  \n  - A secondary road runs from the roundabout to the **top-right**, curving downward.  \n- **Motorway (built 1970)**: Three parallel 1px gray (#c0c0c0) lines, spaced 2px apart, running diagonally from the **bottom-left** to **center-left**.  \n- **Railway (built 1909)**: 1px dashed line (black/white, 4px dashes, 2px gaps) running horizontally through the **center**, passing through Chorleywood Station.  \n- **Chorleywood Station**: A 12px × 6px black rectangle with a 6px × 2px black arrow pointing left (toward the railway). Positioned at the railway’s intersection with main roads (center-left).  \n- **Roundabout**: A 8px-diameter white circle at the **top-right**, with four main roads (2px black) radiating outward: left (to park), right (curved), top (straight), bottom (curved to station).  \n\n#### **Land Use & Development Zones**\n- **Chorleywood Park and Golf Course**: Two large irregular polygons with **45° diagonal black stripes** (1px lines, 2px spacing), labeled in the **upper-center**. One shape is above the roundabout; the other is to the right of the roundabout.  \n- **Development Zones** (irregular polygons, differentiated by pattern):  \n  - **1868–1883**: Light gray (#e6e6e6) solid fill. Small, north of the station, between the main road and railway.  \n  - **1883–1922**: **45° diagonal black stripes** (same as park). Surrounds the station, between the main road and railway.  \n  - **1922–1970**: **Dense black dots** (1px, 2px spacing). Two shapes: a large left lobe (between motorway and main road) and a small lower lobe (between railway and main road).  \n  - **1970–1994**: **135° diagonal black stripes** (1px lines, 2px spacing). Four shapes: two large right lobes (above/below roundabout), a small center lobe (between roundabout and park), and a far-right curved lobe.  \n\n#### **Legend**\nPositioned at the **bottom** (1/5 of the map height), split into two columns:  \n- **Left Column (Infrastructure)**:  \n  - **Main Roads**: 20px × 2px black rectangle. Label: *“Main roads”* (left-aligned, sans-serif, 8px).  \n  - **Motorway (built 1970)**: 20px × 6px group (three 1px gray lines, 2px spacing). Label: *“Motorway (built 1970)”* (8px).  \n  - **Railway (built 1909)**: 20px × 2px dashed line (black/white). Label: *“Railway (built 1909)”* (8px).  \n- **Center Column (Development Periods)**:  \n  - **1868–1883**: 10px × 10px light gray square. Label: *“1868 – 1883”* (8px).  \n  - **1883–1922**: 10px × 10px square with 45° stripes. Label: *“1883 – 1922”* (8px).  \n  - **1922–1970**: 10px × 10px square with dots. Label: *“1922 – 1970”* (8px).  \n  - **1970–1994**: 10px × 10px square with 135° stripes. Label: *“1970 – 1994”* (8px).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Monochrome Palette**: Black, white, and grays (no color).  \n- **Patterns**:  \n  - **Solid**: Light gray (#e6e6e6) for early development (1868–1883).  \n  - **Stripes**: 45° (park/1883–1922) vs. 135° (1970–1994) to distinguish land use vs. later development.  \n  - **Dots**: Dense (1px, 2px spacing) for mid-20th century development (1922–1970).  \n- **Line Weights**:  \n  - Main roads: 2px (bold, prominent).  \n  - Motorway/railway: 1px (thinner, secondary).  \n  - Border/legend icons: 1px (fine, technical).  \n- **Contrast**: Thick black main roads and station symbol stand out against lighter development zones. Patterns (stripes/dots) create visual hierarchy for different time periods.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Central Hub**: Chorleywood Station is at the intersection of the railway (horizontal) and main road (curved), making it the focal point of development.  \n- **Development Expansion**:  \n  - **1868–1883**: Closest to the station (small, central).  \n  - **1883–1922**: Surrounds the station (medium, concentric).  \n  - **1922–1970**: Extends left (motorway side) and below (railway side).  \n  - **1970–1994**: Extends right (roundabout side) and above (park side).  \n- **Park**: Large, undeveloped space in the upper-center, separate from residential/business zones.  \n- **Roundabout**: Key intersection in the upper-right, connecting main roads to the park and outer areas.  \n- **Motorway**: Peripheral transport link on the left, not integrated with the village core.  \n- **Layer Order**:  \n  1. Development zones/park (bottom).  \n  2. Main roads (middle).  \n  3. Railway (top of roads).  \n  4. Station/roundabout (top of all).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Technical/Informational**: Designed for clarity, not aesthetics. Uses standard cartographic symbols (roads, railway, roundabout).  \n- **Simplified Geometry**: Irregular polygons for development zones (organic, realistic) vs. straight/curved lines for infrastructure (abstract, functional).  \n- **Pattern Consistency**: Stripes/dots are uniform across all instances of a time period/land use (e.g., all 1970–1994 zones use 135° stripes).  \n- **Border**: Thin black line encloses the map, giving it a formal, structured look (common in technical diagrams).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Title**: *“Village of Chorleywood showing development between 1868 and 1994”* (top-center, bold sans-serif, 12px).  \n- **Labels**:  \n  - **Chorleywood Station**: Centered above the station symbol (sans-serif, 10px).  \n  - **Chorleywood Park and Golf Course**: Centered between the two park shapes (sans-serif, 10px).  \n  - **Legend**: Left-aligned text next to each icon (sans-serif, 8px). Infrastructure labels include construction years (e.g., *“Motorway (built 1970)”*).  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - **Station**: Black rectangle + arrow (represents a train station, common cartographic symbol).  \n  - **Roundabout**: White circle (represents a traffic circle, standard symbol).  \n  - **Motorway**: Three parallel lines (international symbol for a multi-lane highway).  \n- **Precision**: All text is legible and positioned to avoid overlapping map elements. Legend icons are proportional to their real-world counterparts (e.g., main roads are thicker in the legend than motorway lines).  \n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these rules:  \n1. **Patterns**:  \n   - **Stripes**: Use `<pattern>` elements with consistent angles (45° for park/1883–1922, 135° for 1970–1994) and spacing (1px lines, 2px gaps).  \n   - **Dots**: Use a `<pattern>` with 1px black circles spaced 2px apart.  \n   - **Solid**: Use a light gray fill (#e6e6e6) for 1868–1883.  \n2. **Line Work**:  \n   - Main roads: 2px black `<path>` elements with curved bezier segments.  \n   - Motorway: Three 1px gray `<line>` elements (parallel, 2px spacing).  \n   - Railway: Dashed `<path>` (stroke-dasharray: 4, 2) with black/white alternating strokes (use a `<linearGradient>` for the dash pattern).  \n3. **Symbols**:  \n   - Station: Combine a `<rect>` (12x6px, black) with a `<polygon>` (arrow, 6px long, 2px wide, black).  \n   - Roundabout: `<circle>` (r=4px, white) with four `<path>` elements (main roads) radiating from it.  \n4. **Text**:  \n   - Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for all text. Match sizes (title: 12px, labels: 10px, legend: 8px).  \n   - Align text to avoid overlapping map elements (e.g., station label above the symbol, park label between the two park shapes).  \n5. **Layering**:  \n   - Use `<g>` (group) elements to organize layers: `development-zones`, `infrastructure`, `symbols`, `text`.  \n   - Ensure main roads are above development zones, railway above main roads, and station/roundabout above all.  \n6. **Border**: Add a 1px black `<rect>` around the entire map (use `stroke` with no fill).  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately reflect the structure, symbolism, and visual hierarchy of the original map.",
  "v1_216": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description of its components, layout, and visual properties:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **thematic map/plan of Garlsdon**, a town with a population of 65,000. Key elements include:  \n- **Town Boundary**: An irregular, hand-drawn-style solid line enclosing the town.  \n- **Zones** (from outermost to innermost):  \n  - **Countryside**: White background outside the town boundary (legend-defined).  \n  - **Industry**: Dark brown, irregularly shaped polygon filling ~80% of the town boundary.  \n  - **Housing**: Red, irregular ring surrounding the town center, filling ~15% of the town boundary.  \n  - **Town Centre (No Traffic Zone)**: Light yellow, irregular polygon in the exact center, filling ~5% of the town boundary.  \n- **Circles**: Two identical white circles with black borders, labeled **S1** (left of center) and **S2** (center of the Town Centre).  \n- **Transport**:  \n  - **Railway**: Dashed line running northwest-to-southeast through the town, passing through **S1**.  \n  - **Main Roads**: Three solid lines with triangular arrowheads, indicating direction to nearby towns (Hindon, Bransdon, Cransdon).  \n- **Legend**: Vertical list of 6 entries (zones + transport) at the top-right.  \n- **North Arrow**: Simple upward-pointing arrow labeled **N** at the top-center.  \n- **Text Labels**: Town names, populations, distances, and zone descriptions.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are flat (no gradients) for a schematic, map-like style. Key color assignments:  \n\n| Element | Color (Hex) | Description |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Garlsdon Label** (background) | `#F0E68C` (khaki) | Light yellow rectangle with a thin black border. |\n| **Garlsdon Label** (text) | `#000000` (black) | \"GARLSDON\" (bold, uppercase); \"Population 65,000\" (regular). |\n| **North Arrow** | `#000000` (black) | Simple line arrow with \"N\" (uppercase) at the top. |\n| **Legend Symbols** |  | - **Countryside**: White square (`#FFFFFF`)<br>- **Town Centre**: Khaki square (`#F0E68C`)<br>- **Housing**: Dark red square (`#8B0000`)<br>- **Industry**: Dark brown square (`#654321`)<br>- **Railway**: Dashed black line (`#000000`)<br>- **Main Roads**: Solid black line with arrowheads (`#000000`). |\n| **Zones** |  | - **Countryside**: White (`#FFFFFF`) (background outside town boundary)<br>- **Industry**: Dark brown (`#654321`) (largest internal zone)<br>- **Housing**: Dark red (`#8B0000`) (ring around Town Centre)<br>- **Town Centre**: Khaki (`#F0E68C`) (central zone). |\n| **Circles (S1/S2)** | `#FFFFFF` (fill), `#000000` (border) | Identical size; \"S1\"/\"S2\" (bold, black) centered inside. |\n| **Lines** |  | - **Town Boundary**: Solid black (`#000000`), medium thickness (~1.5px)<br>- **Railway**: Dashed black (`#000000`), thin (~0.75px), dash/gap ratio 2:1<br>- **Main Roads**: Solid black (`#000000`), medium thickness (~1.5px), with filled triangular arrowheads. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **centered and hierarchical**, with labels and legends framing the main map:  \n\n- **Top Section**:  \n  - **Garlsdon Label**: Top-center, 1/3 width of the image, 1/10 height.  \n  - **North Arrow**: Right of the Garlsdon label, aligned vertically with its top edge.  \n  - **Legend**: Top-right, vertical list (6 entries), each with a symbol (left) and text (right).  \n- **Main Map (Lower 2/3 of Image)**:  \n  - **Town Boundary**: Irregular, roughly oval shape, centered horizontally, occupying ~70% of the image height.  \n  - **Zones**: Concentric (irregular) layers:  \n    - **Industry** (dark brown) fills most of the town boundary.  \n    - **Housing** (red) forms a ring around the **Town Centre** (khaki) in the exact center.  \n    - **Countryside** (white) surrounds the town boundary.  \n  - **Circles**:  \n    - **S1**: Left of center, on the railway line, ~1/3 from the top.  \n    - **S2**: Exact center of the Town Centre zone.  \n  - **Transport**:  \n    - **Railway**: Dashed line running northwest-to-southeast through the town, passing through **S1** and curving near the Town Centre.  \n    - **Main Roads**:  \n      - **12 km to Hindon**: Northwest corner, arrow pointing northwest (towards Hindon), aligned with the railway.  \n      - **16 km to Bransdon**: Southwest corner, arrow pointing southwest (towards Bransdon).  \n      - **25 km to Cransdon**: Southeast corner, arrow pointing southeast (towards Cransdon).  \n  - **Text Labels**: Placed along main roads, with arrowheads adjacent to the text (pointing toward the external town).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **schematic, cartographic style** designed for clarity (common in town plans or thematic maps). Key stylistic choices:  \n- **Flat Colors**: No gradients or shadows—uses solid colors for zones to emphasize categorization.  \n- **Simple Lines**: Bold for boundaries/main roads, thin for railways, to differentiate layers.  \n- **Irregular Shapes**: The town boundary and zones have hand-drawn, organic edges (not perfect geometric shapes) to mimic real-world town layouts.  \n- **Hierarchical Text**: \"GARLSDON\" is the largest text (bold, uppercase) to draw attention; legend and distance labels are smaller (regular) for readability.  \n- **Symbol Consistency**: Circles (S1/S2) and legend symbols are uniform in size and style to avoid confusion.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text is **black, sans-serif** (for legibility), with consistent sizing and alignment:  \n\n| Element | Text Content | Style | Position |\n|---------|--------------|-------|----------|\n| **Garlsdon Label** | \"GARLSDON\"<br>\"Population 65,000\" | \"GARLSDON\" (bold, 1.5x larger than subtext); \"Population\" (regular, lowercase) | Centered in the khaki rectangle (top-center). |\n| **North Arrow** | \"N\" | Uppercase, regular | Centered above the arrowhead (top-center right). |\n| **Legend** | \"Countryside\"<br>\"Town Centre (no traffic zone)\"<br>\"Housing\"<br>\"Industry\"<br>\"Railway\"<br>\"Main roads\" | Regular, lowercase (except proper nouns) | Left-aligned, each entry has a symbol (square/line) to the left. |\n| **Distance Labels** | \"12 km to Hindon population 10,000\"<br>\"16 km to Bransdon population 15,000\"<br>\"25 km to Cransdon population 29,000\" | Regular, lowercase (except town names) | Placed along main roads, with arrowheads pointing toward the external town. |\n| **Circles** | \"S1\"<br>\"S2\" | Bold, uppercase | Centered inside white circles (S1: left of center; S2: center). |\n\n**Symbols**:  \n- **Arrowheads**: Triangular, filled black, ~2x the thickness of main roads, pointing toward external towns.  \n- **Legend Squares**: 5x5px (relative to image size), aligned vertically with text.  \n- **Railway Dashes**: 4px long, 2px gap (consistent throughout).  \n\n\n### **Key SVG Reproduction Notes**\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into layers (e.g., \"Zones\", \"Transport\", \"Text\", \"Legend\") for editability.  \n- **Proportions**: Maintain relative sizes (e.g., S1/S2 circles are identical; \"GARLSDON\" is 1.5x larger than subtext).  \n- **Irregular Shapes**: Use `path` elements with bezier curves for the town boundary and zones (avoid perfect rectangles/circles).  \n- **Dashed Lines**: For railways, use `stroke-dasharray=\"4 2\"` (4px dash, 2px gap) to match the legend.  \n- **Arrowheads**: Use `marker` elements for main roads (reusable for consistency).  \n\nThis detailed breakdown provides all geometric, color, and layout information needed to accurately recreate the image as an SVG.",
  "v1_217": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its components, layout, and visual properties. The design follows a **flowchart-style layout** with a central processing node (laptop) connected to input data sources, analysis tools, and output channels. All elements are simplified, flat, and optimized for clarity.\n\n\n## 1.

Icon (40px × 30px) above text (10px tall).  \n- **Radio**: Middle-right (350px from top, 750px from left). Icon (30px × 20px) above text (10px tall).  \n- **Recorded Announcement**: Bottom-right (600px from top, 750px from left). Icon (30px × 20px base + 20px × 10px handset) above text (10px tall).  \n\n### Connections\n- **Input → Analysis**: Straight lines from input icons to analysis icons (e.g., Satellite → Analysis & Forecasting: 100px top → 100px top).  \n- **Analysis → Laptop**: Straight lines from analysis icons to laptop screen (e.g., Analysis & Forecasting → Laptop: 250px left → 500px left).  \n- **Laptop → Output**: Straight lines from laptop screen to output icons (e.g., Laptop → TV Newsreader: 500px left → 750px left).  \n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Flat Design**: No 3D effects or gradients—all elements are 2D with solid colors.  \n- **Bold Lines**: Connections (1.5px thick) and text (uppercase, sans-serif) ensure clarity at small sizes.  \n- **Alignment**: Elements are vertically aligned (inputs/outputs) and horizontally centered (analysis tools/laptop) for balance.  \n- **Simplification**: Icons are abstract (e.g., satellite = circle + cross; buoy = rectangle + waves) to avoid clutter.  \n- **Contrast**: Dark inputs/outputs against a white background, green analysis icons against light blue for emphasis.  \n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Text\n- **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial Bold), uppercase, black (#000000).  \n- **Sizes**: 12px for analysis headers (\"ANALYSIS & FORECASTING\"), 10px for input/output labels (\"SATELLITE\", \"TV NEWSREADER\").  \n- **Positioning**: Text is always below icons (inputs/outputs) or above/below analysis tools (per layout).  \n\n### Symbols\n- **Satellite**: Circle (10px diameter) + two 15px crossed lines (solar panels) + 5px triangular dish (top).  \n- **Radar**: Circle (15px diameter) + 12px radial line (rotation indicator).  \n- **Digital Buoy**: 15px × 10px vertical rectangle + three 10px curved lines (waves) below.  \n- **Satellite Photo**: 40px × 30px rectangle + 2px green grid (10° intervals) + 20px × 15px brown landmass (Australia).  \n- **Radar Screen**: 30px × 30px circle + 2px green concentric/radial grid + 15px × 10px brown landmass (Australia).  \n- **Synoptic Chart**: 40px × 30px rectangle + 2px green contour lines (isobars) + 20px × 15px brown landmass (Australia).  \n- **TV Newsreader**: 40px × 30px rectangle + 15px × 10px light gray face + 20px × 15px green map (Australia).  \n- **Radio**: 30px × 20px rectangle + 15px × 10px black speaker grille + 5px circle (dial, top-right).  \n- **Recorded Announcement**: 25px × 15px base + 18px × 8px handset + 10px curved cord (connecting base to handset).  \n\n### Specific Details\n- **Laptop Screen**: 5px black dot (cursor) in the center to indicate activity.  \n- **Synoptic Chart**: Contour lines are spaced 3px apart (simulating isobars).  \n- **TV Newsreader**: Map of Australia is simplified (green #008000) with no labels.  \n- **Digital Buoy**: Waves are three 10px curved lines (bottom of icon) to represent marine movement.  \n\n\n## SVG Recreation Guidelines\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these rules when coding the SVG:\n1. **Group Elements**: Use `<g>` tags to group icons with text (e.g., `<g id=\"satellite\"><circle.../><text.../></g>`).  \n2. **Lines**: Use `<line>` tags for connections, with `stroke=\"#0000FF\"` and `stroke-width=\"1.5\"`. Arrowheads can be added with `<polygon>` tags (5px × 3px) at line endpoints.  \n3. **Colors**: Use hex codes (e.g., `fill=\"#008000\"` for green grid lines).  \n4. **Proportions**: Maintain the relative spacing (e.g., input-to-analysis distance = 200px on a 1000px canvas) to preserve layout balance.  \n5. **Text**: Use `<text>` tags with `font-family=\"Arial Bold\"`, `font-size=\"10px\"`, and `text-anchor=\"middle\"` for centering.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. Adjust dimensions and colors slightly for final output, but keep the layout and symbolism consistent.",

Key spatial logic:\n\n#### **Top Row**  \n- **Left Column**: Red bell peppers (rectangular) + yellow bell peppers (rectangular)  \n- **Center Column**: Cauliflower (red container) + pears (rectangular)  \n- **Right Column**: Green apples (rectangular) + green grapes (clustered)  \n\n#### **Middle Row**  \n- **Left Column**: Cucumbers (stepped rows) + cherry tomatoes (pyramidal) + red peppers (Ecuador, pyramidal)  \n- **Center-Left Column**: Tomatoes (pyramidal) + purple grapes (clustered) + oranges (pyramidal)  \n- **Center-Right Column**: Pears (rectangular) + lemons (rectangular) + green grapes (clustered)  \n- **Right Column**: Red apples (rectangular) + green apples (rectangular)  \n\n#### **Bottom Row**  \n- **Left Column**: Cherry tomatoes (continuation) + red peppers (Ecuador, continuation)  \n- **Center Column**: Oranges (continuation) + bananas (bunches)  \n- **Right Column**: Strawberries (pyramidal) + bananas (continuation)  \n\n#### **Height Hierarchy**  \n- **Tallest Sections**: Middle-center (oranges, cauliflower)  \n- **Shortest Sections**: Bottom-right (strawberries, bananas)  \n- **Signs**: Placed at the **front of each section**, sticking out 1–2 inches above the produce (wooden sticks: 3 inches long, 1/4 inch diameter).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Style**: **Documentary Realism**—the image is a high-fidelity photograph of a real market, so the SVG must prioritize **accuracy** (e.g., produce texture, lighting) over stylization.  \n- **Composition**: **Dense, Symmetrical Grid**—no negative space; sections are tightly packed to emphasize abundance.  \n- **Lighting**: Natural, soft diffused light (no harsh shadows); highlights the vibrancy of produce colors.  \n- **Depth**: Minimal (flat lay), but sections are slightly overlapping (e.g., oranges overlap with grapes) to create subtle层次感 (depth).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text is **Spanish**, printed on **white rectangular paper signs** (1 inch wide × 0.5 inches tall) attached to **thin wooden sticks** (3 inches long, 1/4 inch diameter). Signs are placed at the **front-center of each section**, angled slightly upward for visibility.  \n\n| **Sign Text**               | **Produce**               | **Position**                                  | **Font Details**                               |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| `PIMIENTOS ROJOS 7.00`       | Red Bell Peppers          | Top-left, above red bell peppers              | Produce name: 10pt sans-serif; price: 14pt bold. |\n| `COLIFLOR 8.00`              | Cauliflower               | Top-center, above cauliflower                 | Same font as above.                             |\n| `PEPINO 8.00`                | Cucumbers                 | Left-middle, above cucumbers                  | Same font as above.                             |\n| `CHERRY TOMATES 8.00`        | Cherry Tomatoes           | Left-middle, above cherry tomatoes            | Same font as above.                             |\n| `PIMIENTA ROJA ECUADOR 9.00` | Red Peppers (Ecuador)     | Middle-left, above red peppers                | \"ECUADOR\" in smaller font (8pt).                |\n| `TOMATES 8.00`               | Tomatoes                  | Middle-left, above tomatoes                   | Same font as above.                             |\n| `UVAS NEGRAS 5.00`           | Purple Grapes             | Middle-center, above purple grapes            | Same font as above.                             |\n| `MANDARINAS SANGRE 12.00`    | Blood Mandarins (Oranges) | Middle-center, above oranges                  | \"SANGRE\" (variety) in blue ink; price in bold.  |\n| `PERAS 7.00`                 | Pears                     | Center-right, above pears                     | Same font as above.                             |\n| `LIMONES 7.00`               | Lemons                    | Center-right, above lemons                    | Same font as above.                             |\n| `UVAS VERDES 7.00`           | Green Grapes              | Right-middle, above green grapes              | Same font as above.                             |\n| `MANZANAS ROJAS 7.00`        | Red Apples                | Right-middle, above red apples                | Same font as above.                             |\n| `MANZANAS VERDES 7.00`       | Green Apples              | Right-middle, above green apples              | Same font as above.                             |\n| `FRESAS 15.00`               | Strawberries              | Bottom-right, above strawberries              | Same font as above (price: 15.00).              |\n\n#### **Critical Specific Details**  \n- **Cauliflower Container**: A red rectangular box (`#FF0000`) behind the florets; visible edges are 0.5 inches thick.  \n- **Cucumber Stacking**: Rows are offset by 0.25 inches to create a \"stepped\" effect (e.g., row 1: 8 cucumbers, row 2: 7 cucumbers, etc.).  \n- **Banana Bunches**: 3–4 bunches total, each with 5–7 bananas; stems are clustered at the top of the bunch.  \n- **Strawberry Pyramid**: Base: 4 inches wide × 2 inches tall; top: 1 inch wide × 1 inch tall.  \n- **Sign Placement**: Sticks are inserted at a 45° angle (from front to back) so signs are visible above the produce.  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric Proportions for SVG**\nTo ensure scale consistency, assume the entire image has a **width-to-height ratio of 3:2** (e.g., 1200px wide × 800px tall).

SVG Design Notes**\n- **Layers**: Use separate layers for **produce sections**, **signs**, and **background** (subtle market stall structure, e.g., wooden shelves).  \n- **Textures**: Add subtle gradients to mimic natural produce textures (e.g., cucumbers: dark green gradient from center to edges; oranges: radial gradient for shine).  \n- **Shadows**: Soft, diffused shadows (10% opacity, 2px blur) under sections to create depth (e.g., oranges cast a shadow on bananas below).  \n- **Signs**: The wooden stick should be a thin rectangle (`#8B4513`) with a rounded top; the paper sign is a white rectangle with black text (use `Arial` or `Helvetica` for authenticity).  \n- **Background**: A light gray (`#D3D3D3`) gradient (lighter in the center, darker at edges) to simulate natural lighting.  \n\nBy following this description, an SVG designer can recreate the image with precision—capturing the abundance, vibrancy, and organizational logic of the market stall while adhering to the geometric and textual details required for accuracy.",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe stall is organized in a **dense, grid-like layout** with no negative space, emphasizing abundance. Sections are adjacent (no gaps) and arranged in **3 horizontal rows** (top, middle, bottom) and **4 vertical columns** (left, center-left, center-right, right). Key spatial logic:\n\n#### **Top Row**  \n- **Left Column**: Red bell peppers (rectangular) + yellow bell peppers (rectangular)  \n- **Center Column**: Cauliflower (red container) + pears (rectangular)  \n- **Right Column**: Green apples (rectangular) + green grapes (clustered)  \n\n#### **Middle Row**  \n- **Left Column**: Cucumbers (stepped rows) + cherry tomatoes (pyramidal) + red peppers (Ecuador, pyramidal)  \n- **Center-Left Column**: Tomatoes (pyramidal) + purple grapes (clustered) + oranges (pyramidal)  \n- **Center-Right Column**: Pears (rectangular) + lemons (rectangular) + green grapes (clustered)  \n- **Right Column**: Red apples (rectangular) + green apples (rectangular)  \n\n#### **Bottom Row**  \n- **Left Column**: Cherry tomatoes (continuation) + red peppers (Ecuador, continuation)  \n- **Center Column**: Oranges (continuation) + bananas (bunches)  \n- **Right Column**: Strawberries (pyramidal) + bananas (continuation)  \n\n#### **Height Hierarchy**  \n- **Tallest Sections**: Middle-center (oranges, cauliflower)  \n- **Shortest Sections**: Bottom-right (strawberries, bananas)  \n- **Signs**: Placed at the **front of each section**, sticking out 1–2 inches above the produce (wooden sticks: 3 inches long, 1/4 inch diameter).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Style**: **Documentary Realism**—the image is a high-fidelity photograph of a real market, so the SVG must prioritize **accuracy** (e.g., produce texture, lighting) over stylization.  \n- **Composition**: **Dense, Symmetrical Grid**—no negative space; sections are tightly packed to emphasize abundance.  \n- **Lighting**: Natural, soft diffused light (no harsh shadows); highlights the vibrancy of produce colors.  \n- **Depth**: Minimal (flat lay), but sections are slightly overlapping (e.g., oranges overlap with grapes) to create subtle层次感 (depth).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text is **Spanish**, printed on **white rectangular paper signs** (1 inch wide × 0.5 inches tall) attached to **thin wooden sticks** (3 inches long, 1/4 inch diameter). Signs are placed at the **front-center of each section**, angled slightly upward for visibility.  \n\n| **Sign Text**               | **Produce**               | **Position**                                  | **Font Details**                               |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| `PIMIENTOS ROJOS 7.00`       | Red Bell Peppers          | Top-left, above red bell peppers              | Produce name: 10pt sans-serif; price: 14pt bold. |\n| `COLIFLOR 8.00`              | Cauliflower               | Top-center, above cauliflower                 | Same font as above.                             |\n| `PEPINO 8.00`                | Cucumbers                 | Left-middle, above cucumbers                  | Same font as above.                             |\n| `CHERRY TOMATES 8.00`        | Cherry Tomatoes           | Left-middle, above cherry tomatoes            | Same font as above.                             |\n| `PIMIENTA ROJA ECUADOR 9.00` | Red Peppers (Ecuador)     | Middle-left, above red peppers                | \"ECUADOR\" in smaller font (8pt).                |\n| `TOMATES 8.00`               | Tomatoes                  | Middle-left, above tomatoes                   | Same font as above.                             |\n| `UVAS NEGRAS 5.00`           | Purple Grapes             | Middle-center, above purple grapes            | Same font as above.                             |\n| `MANDARINAS SANGRE 12.00`    | Blood Mandarins (Oranges) | Middle-center, above oranges                  | \"SANGRE\" (variety) in blue ink; price in bold.  |\n| `PERAS 7.00`                 | Pears                     | Center-right, above pears                     | Same font as above.                             |\n| `LIMONES 7.00`               | Lemons                    | Center-right, above lemons                    | Same font as above.                             |\n| `UVAS VERDES 7.00`           | Green Grapes              | Right-middle, above green grapes              | Same font as above.                             |\n| `MANZANAS ROJAS 7.00`        | Red Apples                | Right-middle, above red apples                | Same font as above.                             |\n| `MANZANAS VERDES 7.00`       | Green Apples              | Right-middle, above green apples              | Same font as above.                             |\n| `FRESAS 15.00`               | Strawberries              | Bottom-right, above strawberries              | Same font as above (price: 15.00).              |\n\n#### **Critical Specific Details**  \n- **Cauliflower Container**: A red rectangular box (`#FF0000`) behind the florets; visible edges are 0.5 inches thick.  \n- **Cucumber Stacking**: Rows are offset by 0.25 inches to create a \"stepped\" effect (e.g., row 1: 8 cucumbers, row 2: 7 cucumbers, etc.).  \n- **Banana Bunches**: 3–4 bunches total, each with 5–7 bananas; stems are clustered at the top of the bunch.  \n- **Strawberry Pyramid**: Base: 4 inches wide × 2 inches tall; top: 1 inch wide × 1 inch tall.  \n- **Sign Placement**: Sticks are inserted at a 45° angle (from front to back) so signs are visible above the produce.  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric Proportions for SVG**\nTo ensure scale consistency, assume the entire image has a **width-to-height ratio of 3:2** (e.g., 1200px wide × 800px tall). Below are key proportions for SVG elements:\n\n| **Element**               | **Dimensions** (px)       | **Notes**                                      |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **Red Bell Pepper**        | Diameter: 20               | Stacked in a 6×4 grid (6 wide × 4 tall).       |\n| **Yellow Bell Pepper**     | Diameter: 20               | Stacked in a 6×4 grid.                         |\n| **Cauliflower Head**       | Diameter: 40               | Red container: 60×30 (width×height).           |\n| **Cucumber**               | Length: 60; Diameter: 10   | Stacked in 5 rows × 8 columns (stepped).       |\n| **Cherry Tomato**          | Diameter: 10               | Pyramid: Base = 80×60; Top = 40×30.            |\n| **Red Pepper (Ecuador)**   | Diameter: 30               | Pyramid: Base = 60×40; Top = 30×20.            |\n| **Tomato**                 | Diameter: 25               | Pyramid: Base = 80×50; Top = 40×25.            |\n| **Purple Grape**           | Diameter: 5                | Cluster: 40×30 (width×height).                 |\n| **Blood Mandarin**         | Diameter: 30               | Pyramid: Base = 100×70; Top = 50×35.           |\n| **Lemon**                  | Oval: 30×20 (length×width) | Stacked in a 6×4 grid.                         |\n| **Red Apple**              | Diameter: 30               | Stacked in a 6×4 grid.                         |\n| **Green Apple**            | Diameter: 30               | Stacked in a 6×4 grid.                         |\n| **Green Grape**            | Diameter: 5                | Cluster: 40×30.                                |\n| **Pear**                   | Oval: 30×20                | Stacked in a 6×4 grid.                         |\n| **Banana**                 | Length: 60; Diameter: 10   | Bunch: 40×30 (width×height); 5–7 bananas/bunch. |\n| **Strawberry**             | Heart: 10×10 (width×height) | Pyramid: Base = 40×30; Top = 20×15.            |\n| **Sign**                   | 20×10 (width×height)       | Wooden stick: 60×2 (length×width).             |\n\n\n### **7. SVG Design Notes**\n- **Layers**: Use separate layers for **produce sections**, **signs**, and **background** (subtle market stall structure, e.g., wooden shelves).  \n- **Textures**: Add subtle gradients to mimic natural produce textures (e.g., cucumbers: dark green gradient from center to edges; oranges: radial gradient for shine).  \n- **Shadows**: Soft, diffused shadows (10% opacity, 2px blur) under sections to create depth (e.g., oranges cast a shadow on bananas below).  \n- **Signs**: The wooden stick should be a thin rectangle (`#8B4513`) with a rounded top; the paper sign is a white rectangle with black text (use `Arial` or `Helvetica` for authenticity).  \n- **Background**: A light gray (`#D3D3D3`) gradient (lighter in the center, darker at edges) to simulate natural lighting.  \n\nBy following this description, an SVG designer can recreate the image with precision—capturing the abundance, vibrancy, and organizational logic of the market stall while adhering to the geometric and textual details required for accuracy.",
  "v1_25": "To accurately reproduce this image as an SVG, we need to break down its structure, elements, and visual properties into precise, measurable components. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requirements:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of **two data tables** (top and bottom) with embedded photographs, text labels, and percentage values. Key elements include:  \n- **Two Tables**: Each table has 6 columns (`Territory`, `Total`, `M-25`, `M25+`, `F-25`, `F25+`) and 11 rows (10 territories + 1 \"Int'l Average\" row).  \n- **Photographs**: One of a man (top table, left) and one of a woman (bottom table, left).  \n- **Text**: Column headers, territory names, percentage values, \"Awareness\" (top table header), and \"Int'l Average\" (summary row).  \n- **Borders/Lines**: Solid black borders for table cells and a **dashed vertical line** separating the `Total` column from gender/age columns.  \n- **Highlighted Rows**: Yellow backgrounds for specific territories (France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Russia) in both tables.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Colors**  \n- **Table Background**: White (`#ffffff`) for most rows; light yellow (`#fff3cd`) for highlighted territories.  \n- **Borders/Lines**: Solid black (`#000000`) for all table borders; dashed black (`#000000`) for the vertical divider between `Total` and `M-25`.  \n- **Text**: Black (`#000000`) for all text (bold for headers/summaries).  \n- **Photographs**:  \n  - **Top (Man)**: Black suit, white shirt, brown tie; blurred background (red carpet/event).  \n  - **Bottom (Woman)**: Purple sleeveless dress; blurred background (similar event).  \n\n#### **Textures**  \n- **Tables**: Smooth, flat texture with crisp borders.  \n- **Photographs**: Realistic, high-resolution textures (skin, hair, clothing) with blurred backgrounds.  \n\n#### **Visual Properties**  \n- **Alignment**:  \n  - `Territory` column: Left-aligned text (territory names).  \n  - All number columns (`Total`, `M-25`, etc.): Right-aligned percentages.  \n  - Column headers: `Territory` left-aligned; all others right-aligned (to match values).  \n- **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial/Helvetica) for readability.  \n- **Bold Text**: Used for \"Awareness\", column headers, and \"Int'l Average\" to emphasize key elements.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image is a **800px × 450px rectangular container** with two table sections stacked vertically (top: 220px tall; bottom: 220px tall; 10px gap between them).  \n\n#### **Top Table Section**  \n- **Position**: Top of the image, `translate(160, 10)` (160px from left to accommodate the photo; 10px from top).  \n- **Photo (Man)**: 150px wide × 220px tall; positioned at `(10, 10)` (10px from left/top).  \n- **Table Dimensions**: 630px wide × 220px tall (11 rows × 20px/row).  \n- **Columns**:  \n  - `Territory`: 25% of table width (157.5px).  \n  - `Total`, `M-25`, `M25+`, `F-25`, `F25+`: 15% each (94.5px/column).  \n\n#### **Bottom Table Section**  \n- **Position**: Below the top table, `translate(160, 240)` (240px from top: 220px top section + 10px gap + 10px margin).  \n- **Photo (Woman)**: 150px wide × 220px tall; positioned at `(10, 240)` (10px from left; 240px from top).  \n- **Table Dimensions**: Identical to the top table (630px × 220px).  \n\n#### **Key Spatial Details**  \n- **Dashed Vertical Line**: Runs between `Total` and `M-25` columns (x=157.5px) from the top to bottom of each table (y=0 to y=220 for top table; y=0 to y=220 for bottom table).  \n- **\"Int'l Average\" Row**: Positioned at the bottom of each table (11th row, y=200 to y=220 for top table; y=200 to y=220 for bottom table).  \n- **Cell Padding**: 5px left (text columns) / 5px right (number columns) to prevent text from touching borders.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **clean, corporate data-visualization style** with a focus on clarity and readability. Key artistic choices include:  \n- **Grid Layout**: Tables use a rigid grid with consistent row/column dimensions to organize data.  \n- **Subtle Highlighting**: Light yellow (`#fff3cd`) for specific territories draws attention without overwhelming the viewer.  \n- **Human Element**: Photographs add a relatable touch, likely representing spokespeople or celebrities associated with the \"Awareness\" metric.  \n- **Consistency**: Uniform alignment, font styles, and colors across both tables create a cohesive look.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \n- **Main Header**: \"Awareness\" (top table, right-aligned, bold, 14px, uppercase, `#000000`).  \n- **Column Headers**:  \n  - `Territory` (left-aligned, bold, 12px, title case).  \n  - `Total`, `M-25`, `M25+`, `F-25`, `F25+` (right-aligned, bold, 12px; `M/F` uppercase, age ranges with hyphen/plus).  \n- **Territory Names**: Left-aligned, 12px, regular, `#000000` (e.g., \"Australia\", \"France\").  \n- **Percentages**: Right-aligned, 12px, regular, `#000000` (all whole numbers, e.g., \"94%\", \"18%\").  \n- **Summary Row**: \"Int'l Average\" (left-aligned, bold, 12px, title case) with corresponding percentages (right-aligned).  \n\n#### **Symbols**  \n- **Dashed Line**: `stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\"` (4px solid, 2px gap) to separate `Total` from gender/age breakdowns.  \n- **Percent Signs**: Included in all numerical values (e.g., \"94%\").  \n\n#### **Specific Details**  \n- **Highlighted Territories**: France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Russia (yellow background in both tables).  \n- **No Decimals**: All percentages are whole numbers.  \n- **Blurred Photographs**: Backgrounds of both photos are out of focus (likely red carpet/events).  \n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo recreate the image accurately, use the following SVG structure and properties:  \n\n#### **Container**  \n- `<svg width=\"800\" height=\"450\" viewBox=\"0 0 800 450\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">`  \n\n#### **Photographs**  \n- **Man**: `<image x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"150\" height=\"220\" xlink:href=\"man-photo.jpg\" />` (replace with actual image path).  \n- **Woman**: `<image x=\"10\" y=\"240\" width=\"150\" height=\"220\" xlink:href=\"woman-photo.jpg\" />` (replace with actual image path).  \n\n#### **Tables**  \nUse `<g>` groups to organize each table, with `<rect>` for cells and `<text>` for content. Example for the **top table**:  \n```svg\n<!-- Top Table Group -->\n<g transform=\"translate(160, 10)\">\n  <!-- Table Background -->\n  <rect width=\"630\" height=\"220\" fill=\"#ffffff\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  \n  <!-- Dashed Vertical Line (Between Total and M-25) -->\n  <line x1=\"157.5\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"157.5\" y2=\"220\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\" />\n  \n  <!-- Header Row (Territory, Total, etc.) -->\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\">Territory</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">Total</text>\n  <text x=\"247\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">M-25</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for M25+, F-25, F25+ (x increases by 94.5px per column) -->\n  \n  <!-- \"Awareness\" Header -->\n  <text x=\"620\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">Awareness</text>\n  \n  <!-- Data Rows (e.g., Australia) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"20\" width=\"630\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#ffffff\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"30\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\">Australia</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"30\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">94%</text>\n  <text x=\"247\" y=\"30\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">92%</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for M25+, F-25, F25+ -->\n  \n  <!-- Highlighted Row (e.g., France) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"40\" width=\"630\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#fff3cd\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"50\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\">France</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"50\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">40%</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for other highlighted territories -->\n  \n  <!-- \"Int'l Average\" Row -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"200\" width=\"630\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#ffffff\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"210\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\">Int'l Average</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"210\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">64%</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for other columns -->\n</g>\n```\n\n#### **Bottom Table**  \nDuplicate the top table group but adjust the `transform` attribute to `translate(160, 240)` and update the percentage values to match the bottom table data.  \n\n#### **Font**  \nUse a sans-serif font (e.g., `font-family=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"`) for all text to match the corporate style.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical SVG Details**  \n- **Container**: 800px × 450px.  \n- **Tables**: 630px × 220px each, positioned at `(160, 10)` (top) and `(160, 240)` (bottom).  \n- **Photographs**: 150px × 220px, positioned at `(10, 10)` (man) and `(10, 240)` (woman).  \n- **Dashed Line**: `stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\"` at x=157.5px for each table.  \n- **Highlighted Rows**: Fill=`#fff3cd` for France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Russia.  \n- **Text Alignment**: Left for `Territory`; right for all number columns.  \n\nBy following these specifications, you can accurately reproduce the image as an SVG with precise geometric proportions, layout, and visual properties.",

Key artistic choices include:  \n- **Grid Layout**: Tables use a rigid grid with consistent row/column dimensions to organize data.  \n- **Subtle Highlighting**: Light yellow (`#fff3cd`) for specific territories draws attention without overwhelming the viewer.  \n- **Human Element**: Photographs add a relatable touch, likely representing spokespeople or celebrities associated with the \"Awareness\" metric.  \n- **Consistency**: Uniform alignment, font styles, and colors across both tables create a cohesive look.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \n- **Main Header**: \"Awareness\" (top table, right-aligned, bold, 14px, uppercase, `#000000`).  \n- **Column Headers**:  \n  - `Territory` (left-aligned, bold, 12px, title case).  \n  - `Total`, `M-25`, `M25+`, `F-25`, `F25+` (right-aligned, bold, 12px; `M/F` uppercase, age ranges with hyphen/plus).  \n- **Territory Names**: Left-aligned, 12px, regular, `#000000` (e.g., \"Australia\", \"France\").  \n- **Percentages**: Right-aligned, 12px, regular, `#000000` (all whole numbers, e.g., \"94%\", \"18%\").  \n- **Summary Row**: \"Int'l Average\" (left-aligned, bold, 12px, title case) with corresponding percentages (right-aligned).  \n\n#### **Symbols**  \n- **Dashed Line**: `stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\"` (4px solid, 2px gap) to separate `Total` from gender/age breakdowns.  \n- **Percent Signs**: Included in all numerical values (e.g., \"94%\").  \n\n#### **Specific Details**  \n- **Highlighted Territories**: France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Russia (yellow background in both tables).  \n- **No Decimals**: All percentages are whole numbers.  \n- **Blurred Photographs**: Backgrounds of both photos are out of focus (likely red carpet/events).  \n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo recreate the image accurately, use the following SVG structure and properties:  \n\n#### **Container**  \n- `<svg width=\"800\" height=\"450\" viewBox=\"0 0 800 450\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">`  \n\n#### **Photographs**  \n- **Man**: `<image x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"150\" height=\"220\" xlink:href=\"man-photo.jpg\" />` (replace with actual image path).  \n- **Woman**: `<image x=\"10\" y=\"240\" width=\"150\" height=\"220\" xlink:href=\"woman-photo.jpg\" />` (replace with actual image path).  \n\n#### **Tables**  \nUse `<g>` groups to organize each table, with `<rect>` for cells and `<text>` for content. Example for the **top table**:  \n```svg\n<!-- Top Table Group -->\n<g transform=\"translate(160, 10)\">\n  <!-- Table Background -->\n  <rect width=\"630\" height=\"220\" fill=\"#ffffff\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  \n  <!-- Dashed Vertical Line (Between Total and M-25) -->\n  <line x1=\"157.5\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"157.5\" y2=\"220\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\" />\n  \n  <!-- Header Row (Territory, Total, etc.) -->\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\">Territory</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">Total</text>\n  <text x=\"247\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">M-25</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for M25+, F-25, F25+ (x increases by 94.5px per column) -->\n  \n  <!-- \"Awareness\" Header -->\n  <text x=\"620\" y=\"15\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">Awareness</text>\n  \n  <!-- Data Rows (e.g., Australia) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"20\" width=\"630\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#ffffff\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"30\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\">Australia</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"30\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">94%</text>\n  <text x=\"247\" y=\"30\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">92%</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for M25+, F-25, F25+ -->\n  \n  <!-- Highlighted Row (e.g., France) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"40\" width=\"630\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#fff3cd\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"50\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\">France</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"50\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">40%</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for other highlighted territories -->\n  \n  <!-- \"Int'l Average\" Row -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"200\" width=\"630\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#ffffff\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <text x=\"5\" y=\"210\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\">Int'l Average</text>\n  <text x=\"152.5\" y=\"210\" font-size=\"12px\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">64%</text>\n  <!-- Repeat for other columns -->\n</g>\n```\n\n#### **Bottom Table**  \nDuplicate the top table group but adjust the `transform` attribute to `translate(160, 240)` and update the percentage values to match the bottom table data.  \n\n#### **Font**  \nUse a sans-serif font (e.g., `font-family=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"`) for all text to match the corporate style.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical SVG Details**  \n- **Container**: 800px × 450px.  \n- **Tables**: 630px × 220px each, positioned at `(160, 10)` (top) and `(160, 240)` (bottom).  \n- **Photographs**: 150px × 220px, positioned at `(10, 10)` (man) and `(10, 240)` (woman).  \n- **Dashed Line**: `stroke-dasharray=\"4,2\"` at x=157.5px for each table.  \n- **Highlighted Rows**: Fill=`#fff3cd` for France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Russia.  \n- **Text Alignment**: Left for `Territory`; right for all number columns.  \n\nBy following these specifications, you can accurately reproduce the image as an SVG with precise geometric proportions, layout, and visual properties.",
  "v1_27": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its components, including geometric shapes, colors, text, and layout. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s specified focus areas:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is an educational diagram of Earth’s interior, accompanied by a labeled table and instructional text. Key objects include:\n\n#### **Earth Cutaway Diagram**\nA **semicircular cutaway** of Earth (left half shaded to represent the surface, right half showing internal layers) with four concentric/oval layers labeled **1–4**. The layers, from surface to center, are:  \n- **Layer 1 (Crust)**: Outermost boundary (thin, circular).  \n- **Layer 2 (Mantle)**: Thick circular layer inside the crust.  \n- **Layer 3 (Outer Core)**: Oval layer inside the mantle.  \n- **Layer 4 (Inner Core)**: Small oval at the center (solid core).  \n\nThe left half of the diagram features a **shaded semicircle** representing Earth’s surface, with rough **continental outlines** (e.g., Africa and South America).  \n\n#### **Arrow and Labels**\n- A **simple arrow** (line + triangle) pointing to the outermost edge of the diagram, labeled **1** (crust).  \n- Numbers **2** (mantle), **3** (outer core), and **4** (inner core) are placed inside their respective layers.  \n\n#### **Table**\nA 2-column table below the diagram with rows for **Outer core**, **Mantle**, **Crust**, and **Inner core**. The columns are labeled **Layer** (left) and **Number on figure 1** (right).  \n\n#### **Text**\n- Instructional text at the top: *“1. Figure 1 shows the structure of the earth’s interior. Write the number showing each layer in the table below.”*  \n- Diagram caption: *“Figure 1”* (centered below the diagram).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe color palette is grayscale, with contrasting shades to differentiate layers and surface features:  \n- **Surface (Left Semicircle)**: Dark gray (#333) for oceans, medium gray (#666) for continental outlines.  \n- **Crust (Layer 1)**: White (#fff) with a thin black boundary.  \n- **Mantle (Layer 2)**: White (#fff) with a black boundary.  \n- **Outer Core (Layer 3)**: Medium gray (#999) fill, black boundary.  \n- **Inner Core (Layer 4)**: Light gray (#ccc) fill, black boundary.  \n- **Text**: Black (#000) sans-serif font for all labels and instructions.  \n- **Arrow**: Black (#000) stroke and fill.  \n\n**Textures**:  \n- Continental outlines are rough, hand-drawn paths (no texture, just solid color).  \n- Layers have solid fills (no gradients) for simplicity.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is centered and hierarchical, with elements stacked vertically:  \n1. **Top Instructional Text**: Left-aligned at the top of the page (e.g., `(10, 10)` in SVG coordinates).  \n2. **Earth Diagram**: Centered below the text, with a **100-unit radius** (scalable) and center at `(200, 200)`.  \n   - **Left Semicircle**: Covers 90°–270° (from top-left to bottom-left) of the diagram.  \n   - **Layers**:  \n     - **Layer 1 (Crust)**: Outermost circle (radius 100).  \n     - **Layer 2 (Mantle)**: Circle inside Layer 1 (radius 99, creating a 1-unit thick crust).  \n     - **Layer 3 (Outer Core)**: Oval inside Layer 2 (major axis 54, minor axis 40, centered at `(200, 200)`).  \n     - **Layer 4 (Inner Core)**: Small oval inside Layer 3 (major axis 19, minor axis 14, centered at `(200, 200)`).  \n   - **Arrow**: Points to Layer 1 (rightmost edge of the diagram), with the tip at `(200 + 100, 200)` (rightmost point of the crust circle).  \n   - **Numbers**:  \n     - **1**: To the right of the arrow (e.g., `(320, 200)`).  \n     - **2**: Inside the mantle (e.g., `(250, 200)`).  \n     - **3**: Inside the outer core (e.g., `(220, 200)`).  \n     - **4**: Inside the inner core (centered at `(200, 200)`).  \n3. **Figure Caption**: *“Figure 1”* centered below the diagram (e.g., `(200, 320)`).  \n4. **Table**: Centered below the caption, with a **300-unit width** and **100-unit height** (e.g., `(200, 350)`).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe diagram is **technical and educational**, with a minimalist design:  \n- **Lines**: Thin black strokes (width 1) for all boundaries and the arrow.  \n- **Fills**: Solid grays for layers and surface, white for the mantle and crust (to emphasize the cutaway).  \n- **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial) for readability, with bold headers in the table.  \n- **Proportions**:  \n  - **Crust**: 1% of total radius (realistic thinness).  \n  - **Mantle**: 45% of total radius (thickest layer).  \n  - **Outer Core**: 35% of total radius (medium thickness).  \n  - **Inner Core**: 19% of total radius (smallest layer).  \n- **Ovals**: The inner/outer cores are oval (not circular) to visually distinguish them as solid/liquid (a common educational convention).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**\n- **Top Instruction**: *“1. Figure 1 shows the structure of the earth’s interior. Write the number showing each layer in the table below.”*  \n  - **Position**: Left-aligned, font size 12, black.  \n- **Figure Caption**: *“Figure 1”*  \n  - **Position**: Centered below the diagram, font size 12, black.  \n- **Table Headers**:  \n  - **Column 1**: *“Layer”* (left-aligned, bold, font size 10).  \n  - **Column 2**: *“Number on figure 1”* (right-aligned, bold, font size 10).  \n- **Table Rows**:  \n  - *“Outer core”*, *“Mantle”*, *“Crust”*, *“Inner core”* (left-aligned, regular font size 10).  \n\n#### **Symbols**\n- **Arrow**: A right-pointing arrow with a triangular head (base 10 units, height 5 units) pointing to Layer 1. The text *“1”* is right-aligned next to the arrowhead.  \n- **Continental Outlines**: Rough paths representing Africa (top-left) and South America (bottom-left) in the left semicircle.  \n\n#### **Specific Details**\n- **Layer Boundaries**: All layers are separated by thin black lines (stroke width 1).  \n- **Table Borders**: A 1px black border around the table and each cell (collapsed borders).  \n- **Scalability**: All elements use relative units (e.g., percentages, ems) or scalable coordinates (e.g., 100-unit radius) for SVG compatibility.  \n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these geometric and stylistic rules:  \n1. **Earth Diagram**:  \n   - **Crust**: `<circle cx=\"200\" cy=\"200\" r=\"100\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>`  \n   - **Mantle**: `<circle cx=\"200\" cy=\"200\" r=\"99\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"white\"/>`  \n   - **Outer Core**: `<ellipse cx=\"200\" cy=\"200\" rx=\"27\" ry=\"20\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"#999\"/>` (rx = 54/2, ry = 40/2)  \n   - **Inner Core**: `<ellipse cx=\"200\" cy=\"200\" rx=\"9.5\" ry=\"7\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"#ccc\"/>` (rx = 19/2, ry = 14/2)  \n   - **Surface**: `<path d=\"M200 100 A100 100 0 0 1 200 300 L200 100\" fill=\"#333\"/>` (semicircle)  \n   - **Continents**: `<path d=\"M150 120 L160 130 L170 140 ...\" fill=\"#666\"/>` (rough paths for Africa/South America)  \n\n2. **Arrow and Numbers**:  \n   - **Arrow**: `<line x1=\"320\" y1=\"200\" x2=\"300\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>` + `<polygon points=\"300 200, 295 195, 295 205\" fill=\"black\"/>`  \n   - **Number 1**: `<text x=\"325\" y=\"205\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\">1</text>`  \n   - **Number 2**: `<text x=\"250\" y=\"205\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\">2</text>`  \n   - **Number 3**: `<text x=\"220\" y=\"205\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\">3</text>`  \n   - **Number 4**: `<text x=\"200\" y=\"205\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\" text-anchor=\"middle\">4</text>`  \n\n3. **Table**:  \n   - `<table x=\"200\" y=\"350\" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" text-anchor=\"middle\">`  \n     - `<tr>`  \n       - `<th>Layer</th>`  \n       - `<th>Number on figure 1</th>`  \n     - `</tr>`  \n     - `<tr>`  \n       - `<td>Outer core</td>`  \n       - `<td></td>`  \n     - `</tr>`  \n     - `<tr>`  \n       - `<td>Mantle</td>`  \n       - `<td></td>`  \n     - `</tr>`  \n     - `<tr>`  \n       - `<td>Crust</td>`  \n       - `<td></td>`  \n     - `</tr>`  \n     - `<tr>`  \n       - `<td>Inner core</td>`  \n       - `<td></td>`  \n     - `</tr>`  \n   - `</table>`  \n   - **Styling**: Add CSS for borders, padding, and text alignment (e.g., `table { border-collapse: collapse; } th, td { border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; }`).  \n\n4. **Text**:  \n   - Top instruction: `<text x=\"10\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\">1. Figure 1 shows the structure of the earth’s interior. Write the number showing each layer in the table below.</text>`  \n   - Figure caption: `<text x=\"200\" y=\"330\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Figure 1</text>`  \n\n\n### **Final Notes**\n- **Scalability**: Use `viewBox` (e.g., `viewBox=\"0 0 400 500\"`) to ensure the SVG scales correctly.  \n- **Browser Compatibility**: Test for support of `<table>` elements (SVG 1.1+) or use `<rect>` and `<text>` for table cells if needed.  \n- **Accuracy**: Match the oval shapes of the cores and the proportions of the layers to real Earth data (crust: 1%, mantle: 45%, outer core: 35%, inner core: 19% of total radius).  \n\nThis description provides all the technical details needed to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG.",
  "v1_28": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this dynamic motocross race image, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, text/symbols, and geometric properties**—critical for precision in vector art.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **pack of 14 motocross riders** in a tight, high-speed start, surrounded by race-related background elements. Key objects include:  \n- **Riders & Bikes**: 14 distinct riders in protective gear (helmets, jerseys, pants, boots) on dirt bikes. Each bike has a **front triangular number plate** (primary identifier) and a smaller rear plate.  \n- **Dirt Track**: Uneven, clumpy brown soil with a light tan dust cloud rising from the bikes’ rear wheels.  \n- **Background Sponsorship Banners**: A large, continuous blue banner spanning the top third of the image, featuring the **Lucas Oil** logo (left) and **Promotocross.com** (right).  \n- **Small Shed**: A rectangular wooden structure with a gabled roof on the right background, displaying a Red Bull logo.  \n- **Yellow Barrier**: A slanted-top rectangular block on the far left, partially obscured by riders.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Riders & Bikes (Front Pack, Left to Right)**  \nEach rider/bike combination has a unique color scheme for easy differentiation. Below are the **5 closest riders** (sharpest focus) and their key details:  \n| Position | Rider Gear Color | Bike Color | Front Number Plate | Key Sponsors |  \n|----------|------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------|  \n| 1 (Left) | Red jersey + black vest + red pants | Red | White #17 | Suzuki (bike), Red Bull (helmet) |  \n| 2        | Bright green jersey (\"FOX\") + black pants | Green | White #9 | Fox (jersey), Suzuki (bike) |  \n| 3        | Yellow jersey (\"FLY\") + black pants (star accents) | White | Black #16 | Fly (jersey), Star (pants) |  \n| 4        | Red jersey + red pants | Red | White #23 | Honda (bike) |  \n| 5        | Orange/red jersey + orange pants | Orange | White #25 | Red Bull (helmet/bike) |  \n| 6        | Black/white jersey + black pants | White | Black #27 | Fox (jersey) |  \n| 7 (Right) | Blue jersey + blue pants | Blue | White #57 | Yamaha (bike) |  \n\n**Helmets**: Oval-shaped with curved visors (clear, yellow, or blue tints). Examples:  \n- Rider 2 (green jersey): Matte green helmet with a clear visor.  \n- Rider 3 (yellow jersey): Glossy white helmet with a yellow visor.  \n- Rider 5 (orange bike): Multicolored helmet with a Red Bull logo and blue visor.  \n\n**Bikes**: Angular frames with:  \n- **Round headlights** (some clear, some tinted).  \n- **Rectangular handlebars** with grips.  \n- **Triangular front number plates** (centered, bold sans-serif numbers).  \n- **Circular rear wheels** (clay-covered, with visible treads).  \n\n#### **Dirt Track**  \n- **Soil**: Dark brown (#4A2E15), uneven texture with small clumps and indentations.  \n- **Dust Clouds**: Light tan (#D2B48C), wispy/irregular shapes rising from each bike’s rear wheel. More concentrated near the wheels, fading as they rise.  \n\n#### **Background Elements**  \n- **Lucas Oil Banner (Left)**: A shield-shaped logo with a red border, white background, and:  \n  - Red \"LUCAS\" text (top), black \"OIL PRODUCTS INC.\" (bottom).  \n  - Small American flag + checkered flag (top left corner).  \n- **Promotocross.com Banner (Right)**: A rectangular white sign with red \"LUCAS OIL\" (large) and blue \"PROMOTOCROSS.COM\" (smaller above it).  \n- **Shed (Right)**: Rectangular structure with a gabled roof (grey), light brown walls, and a square window (dark frame, black interior). Displays a Red Bull logo.  \n- **Yellow Barrier (Left)**: Slanted-top rectangle (#FFD700), partially hidden by the leftmost rider.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **horizontal** (wider than tall) with a **depth of field** that keeps riders in sharp focus while blurring the background slightly.  \n- **Riders**: Occupy the **lower 2/3 of the image**, packed tightly (almost touching) and leaning forward to indicate motion. The closest riders (5–7) are in the center-left to center-right, with 10–12 more riders visible in the background (blurred but distinct).  \n- **Banners**: Span the **top third** of the image, aligned horizontally. The Lucas Oil shield is left of center, while \"Promotocross.com\" and \"LUCAS OIL\" dominate the right.  \n- **Shed**: Positioned on the **right background**, above the 57号 (blue) rider. Its bottom edge aligns with the top of the riders’ helmets.  \n- **Yellow Barrier**: On the **far left**, behind the 17号 (red) rider. Only the top 1/3 is visible.  \n\n#### **Proportions**  \n- **Riders**: Each is ~1/5 the image height (e.g., 100px in a 500px tall image). Bikes are slightly larger than riders’ torsos.  \n- **Banners**: The Lucas Oil shield is ~1/3 the image width; \"Promotocross.com\" spans 2/3 the width.  \n- **Shed**: ~1/4 the height of the banners (e.g., 50px tall if banners are 200px).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Dynamic Motion**: Conveyed by:  \n  - Riders leaning forward (torso angled 45° toward the track).  \n  - Wispy dust clouds trailing each bike.  \n  - Overlapping riders (tight pack) to emphasize speed.  \n- **Depth of Field**: Riders are in **sharp focus**; background banners/shed are slightly blurred (subtle Gaussian blur) to draw attention to the action.  \n- **Color Contrast**: Bold, saturated colors (red, green, yellow, blue) on riders/bikes contrast with the muted browns of the track and blue banners, creating visual hierarchy.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the **top left**, casting faint shadows on the right side of riders/bikes. Shadows are low-opacity and irregular.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n#### **Bike Number Plates**  \n- **Front Plates**: Triangular, centered on the bike’s front forks. Numbers are bold, sans-serif, and colored for contrast (e.g., white on green/red plates, black on white plates). Key numbers: **9, 16, 23, 25, 27, 57, 17**.  \n- **Rear Plates**: Smaller rectangles on the bike’s back, with the same number as the front (e.g., 16 on the white bike).  \n\n#### **Sponsor Logos**  \n- **Riders**: Logos on jerseys, helmets, and pants:  \n  - \"FOX\" (green rider’s jersey, white text).  \n  - \"Suzuki\" (red rider’s bike, white text).  \n  - \"Red Bull\" (orange rider’s helmet/bike, red/blue logo).  \n  - \"Fly\" (yellow rider’s jersey, black text).  \n- **Background**:  \n  - \"PROMOTOCROSS.COM\" (white text on blue banner, top right).  \n  - \"LUCAS OIL\" (red text on white banner, center right).  \n  - \"OIL PRODUCTS INC.\" (black text on Lucas Oil shield, bottom).  \n\n#### **Miscellaneous Details**  \n- **Visor Tints**: Some riders have colored visors (e.g., yellow on the 16号 rider, blue on the 25号 rider) to add realism.  \n- **Boots**: All riders wear high-top, armored boots (matching jersey color: e.g., red boots on the 23号 rider, black on the 16号 rider).  \n- **Shed Window**: A square opening with a dark brown frame and black interior. A small amount of light filters through, creating a subtle glow.  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric Details for SVG Reproduction**  \n- **Helmets**: Oval with a 1:1.5 width-height ratio. Visors are curved rectangles (1/3 the helmet’s height) attached to the front.  \n- **Bikes**:  \n  - **Forks**: Two parallel rectangles (10px wide) extending from the handlebars to the front wheel.  \n  - **Wheels**: Circles with a 1:1 ratio; rear wheel is 1.2x larger than the front.  \n  - **Number Plates**: Triangles with a 30° apex (base width = 1/2 the bike’s handlebar width).  \n- **Banners**:  \n  - **Lucas Oil Shield**: 150px wide x 100px tall (example), with a 5px red border. The American/checkered flags are 10px x 10px, positioned in the top left corner.  \n  - **Promotocross.com**: Rectangular, 300px wide x 80px tall, with white \"PROMOTOCROSS.COM\" text (18px font) above red \"LUCAS OIL\" (36px font).  \n- **Shed**: 80px wide x 60px tall, with a gabled roof (two 45° triangles meeting at the top). The window is 20px x 20px, centered on the front wall.  \n\n\n### **7. Opacity and Layering**  \n- **Dust Clouds**: 30–50% opacity (translucent) to show the track beneath.  \n- **Background Banners/Shed**: 70–80% opacity (subtle blur) to maintain depth.  \n- **Riders/Bikes**: 100% opacity (sharp focus) to prioritize the action.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Workflow**  \n1. **Layer Order**:  \n   - **Bottom**: Dirt track (brown, clumpy texture).  \n   - **Middle**: Dust clouds (light tan, wispy shapes).  \n   - **Top**: Riders/bikes (sharp, colored gear; numbered plates).  \n   - **Foreground**: Yellow barrier (left) and shed (right).  \n   - **Background**: Sponsorship banners (blurred, lower opacity).  \n\n2. **Key Tips**:  \n   - Use **vector paths** for all shapes (helmets, bikes, banners) to maintain scalability.  \n   - Add **gradient fills** to dust clouds (light tan to transparent) for a hazy effect.  \n   - Use **clipping masks** to overlap riders without losing detail (e.g., the 9号 rider’s green bike partially obscures the 16号 rider’s white bike).  \n   - Apply **subtle blur** to background elements (banners/shed) using SVG’s `<filter>` element (e.g., `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"2\">`).  \n\nBy following this detailed breakdown, the SVG will accurately capture the energy, color, and precision of the original motocross race image.",
  "v1_29": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this dynamic motocross race image, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, text/symbols, and geometric properties**—critical for precision in vector art.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **pack of 14 motocross riders** in a tight, high-speed start, surrounded by race-related background elements. Key objects include:  \n- **Riders & Bikes**: 14 distinct riders in protective gear (helmets, jerseys, pants, boots) on dirt bikes. Each bike has a **front triangular number plate** (primary identifier) and a smaller rear plate.  \n- **Dirt Track**: Uneven, clumpy brown soil with a light tan dust cloud rising from the bikes’ rear wheels.  \n- **Background Sponsorship Banners**: A large, continuous blue banner spanning the top third of the image, featuring the **Lucas Oil** logo (left) and **Promotocross.com** (right).  \n- **Small Shed**: A rectangular wooden structure with a gabled roof on the right background, displaying a Red Bull logo.  \n- **Yellow Barrier**: A slanted-top rectangular block on the far left, partially obscured by riders.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Riders & Bikes (Front Pack, Left to Right)**  \nEach rider/bike combination has a unique color scheme for easy differentiation. Below are the **5 closest riders** (sharpest focus) and their key details:  \n| Position | Rider Gear Color | Bike Color | Front Number Plate | Key Sponsors |  \n|----------|------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------|  \n| 1 (Left) | Red jersey + black vest + red pants | Red | White #17 | Suzuki (bike), Red Bull (helmet) |  \n| 2        | Bright green jersey (\"FOX\") + black pants | Green | White #9 | Fox (jersey), Suzuki (bike) |  \n| 3        | Yellow jersey (\"FLY\") + black pants (star accents) | White | Black #16 | Fly (jersey), Star (pants) |  \n| 4        | Red jersey + red pants | Red | White #23 | Honda (bike) |  \n| 5        | Orange/red jersey + orange pants | Orange | White #25 | Red Bull (helmet/bike) |  \n| 6        | Black/white jersey + black pants | White | Black #27 | Fox (jersey) |  \n| 7 (Right) | Blue jersey + blue pants | Blue | White #57 | Yamaha (bike) |  \n\n**Helmets**: Oval-shaped with curved visors (clear, yellow, or blue tints). Examples:  \n- Rider 2 (green jersey): Matte green helmet with a clear visor.  \n- Rider 3 (yellow jersey): Glossy white helmet with a yellow visor.  \n- Rider 5 (orange bike): Multicolored helmet with a Red Bull logo and blue visor.  \n\n**Bikes**: Angular frames with:  \n- **Round headlights** (some clear, some tinted).  \n- **Rectangular handlebars** with grips.  \n- **Triangular front number plates** (centered, bold sans-serif numbers).  \n- **Circular rear wheels** (clay-covered, with visible treads).  \n\n#### **Dirt Track**  \n- **Soil**: Dark brown (#4A2E15), uneven texture with small clumps and indentations.  \n- **Dust Clouds**: Light tan (#D2B48C), wispy/irregular shapes rising from each bike’s rear wheel. More concentrated near the wheels, fading as they rise.  \n\n#### **Background Elements**  \n- **Lucas Oil Banner (Left)**: A shield-shaped logo with a red border, white background, and:  \n  - Red \"LUCAS\" text (top), black \"OIL PRODUCTS INC.\" (bottom).  \n  - Small American flag + checkered flag (top left corner).  \n- **Promotocross.com Banner (Right)**: A rectangular white sign with red \"LUCAS OIL\" (large) and blue \"PROMOTOCROSS.COM\" (smaller above it).  \n- **Shed (Right)**: Rectangular structure with a gabled roof (grey), light brown walls, and a square window (dark frame, black interior). Displays a Red Bull logo.  \n- **Yellow Barrier (Left)**: Slanted-top rectangle (#FFD700), partially hidden by the leftmost rider.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **horizontal** (wider than tall) with a **depth of field** that keeps riders in sharp focus while blurring the background slightly.  \n- **Riders**: Occupy the **lower 2/3 of the image**, packed tightly (almost touching) and leaning forward to indicate motion. The closest riders (5–7) are in the center-left to center-right, with 10–12 more riders visible in the background (blurred but distinct).  \n- **Banners**: Span the **top third** of the image, aligned horizontally. The Lucas Oil shield is left of center, while \"Promotocross.com\" and \"LUCAS OIL\" dominate the right.  \n- **Shed**: Positioned on the **right background**, above the 57号 (blue) rider. Its bottom edge aligns with the top of the riders’ helmets.  \n- **Yellow Barrier**: On the **far left**, behind the 17号 (red) rider. Only the top 1/3 is visible.  \n\n#### **Proportions**  \n- **Riders**: Each is ~1/5 the image height (e.g., 100px in a 500px tall image). Bikes are slightly larger than riders’ torsos.  \n- **Banners**: The Lucas Oil shield is ~1/3 the image width; \"Promotocross.com\" spans 2/3 the width.  \n- **Shed**: ~1/4 the height of the banners (e.g., 50px tall if banners are 200px).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Dynamic Motion**: Conveyed by:  \n  - Riders leaning forward (torso angled 45° toward the track).  \n  - Wispy dust clouds trailing each bike.  \n  - Overlapping riders (tight pack) to emphasize speed.  \n- **Depth of Field**: Riders are in **sharp focus**; background banners/shed are slightly blurred (subtle Gaussian blur) to draw attention to the action.  \n- **Color Contrast**: Bold, saturated colors (red, green, yellow, blue) on riders/bikes contrast with the muted browns of the track and blue banners, creating visual hierarchy.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light from the **top left**, casting faint shadows on the right side of riders/bikes. Shadows are low-opacity and irregular.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n#### **Bike Number Plates**  \n- **Front Plates**: Triangular, centered on the bike’s front forks. Numbers are bold, sans-serif, and colored for contrast (e.g., white on green/red plates, black on white plates). Key numbers: **9, 16, 23, 25, 27, 57, 17**.  \n- **Rear Plates**: Smaller rectangles on the bike’s back, with the same number as the front (e.g., 16 on the white bike).  \n\n#### **Sponsor Logos**  \n- **Riders**: Logos on jerseys, helmets, and pants:  \n  - \"FOX\" (green rider’s jersey, white text).  \n  - \"Suzuki\" (red rider’s bike, white text).  \n  - \"Red Bull\" (orange rider’s helmet/bike, red/blue logo).  \n  - \"Fly\" (yellow rider’s jersey, black text).  \n- **Background**:  \n  - \"PROMOTOCROSS.COM\" (white text on blue banner, top right).  \n  - \"LUCAS OIL\" (red text on white banner, center right).  \n  - \"OIL PRODUCTS INC.\" (black text on Lucas Oil shield, bottom).  \n\n#### **Miscellaneous Details**  \n- **Visor Tints**: Some riders have colored visors (e.g., yellow on the 16号 rider, blue on the 25号 rider) to add realism.  \n- **Boots**: All riders wear high-top, armored boots (matching jersey color: e.g., red boots on the 23号 rider, black on the 16号 rider).  \n- **Shed Window**: A square opening with a dark brown frame and black interior.

  "v1_3": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, technical description covering all critical elements—including layout, geometry, text, and style—organized by your specified focus areas:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of a **3-row × 2-column grid** of rectangular cells, each containing a simple addition equation. The primary objects are:  \n- **6 rectangular cells**: Equal-sized, bordered boxes forming the grid.  \n- **6 text equations**: One per cell, formatted as `[Digit] + [Digit] =` (e.g., `4 + 7 =`).  \n\nNo other objects (e.g., images, icons) are present. The design is purely functional, resembling a math worksheet.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Background**: Solid white (`#ffffff`), spanning the entire canvas.  \n- **Cell Borders**: Solid black (`#000000`), consistent stroke width (e.g., `1px`; fixed, not relative, to maintain clarity at any scale).  \n- **Cell Fill**: Solid white (`#ffffff`), matching the background (no transparency).  \n- **Text**: Solid black (`#000000`), sans-serif font (e.g., `Arial` or `Helvetica`), regular weight (not bold).  \n- **Textures**: All elements are flat (no gradients, patterns, or shadows).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe grid is **tight** (no gaps between cells) and aligned to the top-left corner of the canvas. Key spatial rules:  \n- **Grid Dimensions**:  \n  - Let the total canvas width = `W` and height = `H`.  \n  - Each cell has width = `W/2` (2 columns) and height = `H/3` (3 rows).  \n  - Example (used in SVG code below): `W = 200px`, `H = 300px` → cell size = `100px × 100px`.  \n\n- **Cell Positions**:  \n  Cells are adjacent, with borders touching. Coordinates (using the 200×300 canvas example):  \n  | Row | Column | Cell Bounds (x1, y1, x2, y2) |\n  |-----|--------|-------------------------------|\n  | 1   | 1      | (0, 0) → (100, 100)           |\n  | 1   | 2      | (100, 0) → (200, 100)         |\n  | 2   | 1      | (0, 100) → (100, 200)         |\n  | 2   | 2      | (100, 100) → (200, 200)       |\n  | 3   | 1      | (0, 200) → (100, 300)         |\n  | 3   | 2      | (100, 200) → (200, 300)       |\n\n- **Text Alignment**:  \n  Each equation is **centered horizontally and vertically** within its cell. For a 100×100 cell, the text anchor point is at the cell’s midpoint (e.g., `(50, 50)` for the top-left cell).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Style**: Minimalist, functional, and educational (worksheet-style).  \n- **Geometry**: Strictly rectangular grid with axis-aligned cells (no rotation or skew).  \n- **Simplicity**: No decorative elements—focus is on clarity and readability.  \n- **Consistency**: All cells and text follow identical formatting (same border width, font, and alignment).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nEach cell contains a **static addition equation** (no answers, only the left-hand side of the equality). The text is formatted as:  \n- **Structure**: `[Digit] + [Digit] =` (e.g., `4 + 7 =`).  \n- **Numbers**: Single-digit integers (1–9). Specific values:  \n  | Row | Column | Equation |\n  |-----|--------|----------|\n  | 1   | 1      | `4 + 7 =` |\n  | 1   | 2      | `7 + 2 =` |\n  | 2   | 1      | `2 + 2 =` |\n  | 2   | 2      | `6 + 1 =` |\n  | 3   | 1      | `9 + 3 =` |\n  | 3   | 2      | `3 + 8 =` |\n\n- **Font Attributes**:  \n  - Family: Sans-serif (e.g., `Arial`, `Helvetica`—common for worksheets).  \n  - Size: Proportional to cell size (e.g., `24px` for a 100×100 cell; adjust for readability).  \n  - Weight: Regular (not bold).  \n  - Spacing: Consistent spaces around the `+` operator (e.g., `4 + 7 =`, not `4+7=`).  \n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo build the SVG, use the following **fixed, measurable values** (example dimensions; scale as needed):  \n- **Canvas**: `<svg width=\"200\" height=\"300\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"#ffffff\">`  \n- **Cells**: 6 `<rect>` elements with:  \n  - `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` (per the table in §3).  \n  - `stroke=\"#000000\"`, `stroke-width=\"1\"`, `fill=\"#ffffff\"`.  \n- **Text**: 6 `<text>` elements with:  \n  - `x` (cell midpoint: `50` for left column, `150` for right column).  \n  - `y` (cell midpoint: `50` for row 1, `150` for row 2, `250` for row 3).  \n  - `font-family=\"Arial\"`, `font-size=\"24\"`, `fill=\"#000000\"`.  \n  - `text-anchor=\"middle\"` (horizontal centering), `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"` (vertical centering).  \n\n#### **Example SVG Code**\n```svg\n<svg width=\"200\" height=\"300\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"#ffffff\">\n  <!-- Grid Cells (3 rows × 2 columns) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"100\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"200\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"200\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  \n  <!-- Centered Text Equations -->\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"50\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">4 + 7 =</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"50\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">7 + 2 =</text>\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"150\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">2 + 2 =</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"150\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">6 + 1 =</text>\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"250\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">9 + 3 =</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"250\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">3 + 8 =</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Key Notes for Accuracy**\n- **Stroke Width**: Use a fixed value (e.g., `1px`) to avoid scaling issues.  \n- **Text Anchoring**: `text-anchor=\"middle\"` and `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"` are critical for perfect centering.  \n- **Cell Adjacency**: Ensure cells touch (no gaps) by aligning their edges (e.g., right cell starts at `x=100` if left cell is `width=100`).  \n- **Font Consistency**: Stick to a sans-serif font (e.g., `Arial`) for readability—match the example exactly if a specific font is required (the image does not specify, but sans-serif is standard for worksheets).  \n\nThis description and SVG code will reproduce the image **exactly** as described, with all geometric, spatial, and stylistic details preserved.",

Specific values:  \n  | Row | Column | Equation |\n  |-----|--------|----------|\n  | 1   | 1      | `4 + 7 =` |\n  | 1   | 2      | `7 + 2 =` |\n  | 2   | 1      | `2 + 2 =` |\n  | 2   | 2      | `6 + 1 =` |\n  | 3   | 1      | `9 + 3 =` |\n  | 3   | 2      | `3 + 8 =` |\n\n- **Font Attributes**:  \n  - Family: Sans-serif (e.g., `Arial`, `Helvetica`—common for worksheets).  \n  - Size: Proportional to cell size (e.g., `24px` for a 100×100 cell; adjust for readability).  \n  - Weight: Regular (not bold).  \n  - Spacing: Consistent spaces around the `+` operator (e.g., `4 + 7 =`, not `4+7=`).  \n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo build the SVG, use the following **fixed, measurable values** (example dimensions; scale as needed):  \n- **Canvas**: `<svg width=\"200\" height=\"300\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"#ffffff\">`  \n- **Cells**: 6 `<rect>` elements with:  \n  - `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` (per the table in §3).  \n  - `stroke=\"#000000\"`, `stroke-width=\"1\"`, `fill=\"#ffffff\"`.  \n- **Text**: 6 `<text>` elements with:  \n  - `x` (cell midpoint: `50` for left column, `150` for right column).  \n  - `y` (cell midpoint: `50` for row 1, `150` for row 2, `250` for row 3).  \n  - `font-family=\"Arial\"`, `font-size=\"24\"`, `fill=\"#000000\"`.  \n  - `text-anchor=\"middle\"` (horizontal centering), `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"` (vertical centering).  \n\n#### **Example SVG Code**\n```svg\n<svg width=\"200\" height=\"300\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"#ffffff\">\n  <!-- Grid Cells (3 rows × 2 columns) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"100\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"200\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"200\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" />\n  \n  <!-- Centered Text Equations -->\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"50\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">4 + 7 =</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"50\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">7 + 2 =</text>\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"150\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">2 + 2 =</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"150\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">6 + 1 =</text>\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"250\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">9 + 3 =</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"250\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"24\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">3 + 8 =</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Key Notes for Accuracy**\n- **Stroke Width**: Use a fixed value (e.g., `1px`) to avoid scaling issues.  \n- **Text Anchoring**: `text-anchor=\"middle\"` and `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"` are critical for perfect centering.  \n- **Cell Adjacency**: Ensure cells touch (no gaps) by aligning their edges (e.g., right cell starts at `x=100` if left cell is `width=100`).  \n- **Font Consistency**: Stick to a sans-serif font (e.g., `Arial`) for readability—match the example exactly if a specific font is required (the image does not specify, but sans-serif is standard for worksheets).  \n\nThis description and SVG code will reproduce the image **exactly** as described, with all geometric, spatial, and stylistic details preserved.",
  "v1_30": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, here is a detailed, structured description covering all critical elements, with a focus on geometric precision, spatial relationships, and visual properties:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image features **two military fighter jets** (likely F/A-18F Super Hornets, given their twin vertical stabilizers, tandem cockpits, and U.S. Navy markings) flying in formation above a layer of clouds. The composition is dominated by a **foreground jet** (sharply in focus) and a smaller **background jet** (slightly softened for depth). Key components of each jet include:\n\n#### **Foreground Jet (Primary Subject)**\n- **Fuselage**: A long, streamlined ogive shape (pointed nose tapering to the tail) with a flattened top. The cross-section is roughly rectangular with rounded edges.\n- **Wings**: Fixed, trapezoidal wings with a 40° swept leading edge. Each wing has a **leading edge extension (LERX)**—a curved, triangular panel merging with the fuselage to enhance maneuverability. The wings are mounted low on the fuselage, with a slight anhedral (downward angle) for stability.\n- **Vertical Stabilizers**: Two triangular, outward-angled (15° dihedral) fins at the rear of the fuselage. Each fin has a rounded top and a small cutout at the base for the horizontal stabilizers.\n- **Horizontal Stabilizers (Elevators)**: Trapezoidal panels mounted on the rear fuselage, below the vertical stabilizers. They are angled slightly upward (5°) and extend beyond the fuselage.\n- **Engines**: Twin cylindrical turbofans mounted under the wings at the rear. Each engine has a closed afterburner nozzle (metallic, with a matte finish) and a small exhaust cone.\n- **Cockpit**: A tandem two-seat configuration (pilot in front, weapons systems officer behind) with a single-piece, tinted glass canopy. The canopy curves smoothly from the nose to the mid-fuselage.\n- **Weapons Pylons**: Two small, rectangular hardpoints under each wing (no ordnance attached in the image).\n\n#### **Background Jet**\n- Identical in design to the foreground jet but **1/3 the size** (to convey depth). Positioned in the upper center, flying parallel to the foreground jet.\n- Key details (scaled down): Tandem cockpit, vertical stabilizers with decals, and a pointed nose.\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Clouds**: A dense layer of cumulus clouds filling the lower 2/3 of the image. Clouds are fluffy, with irregular, rounded edges and varying densities (some appear translucent, others opaque).\n- **Sky**: A gradient from deep blue (bottom) to pale gold (top), with the sun shining from the **upper right corner** (not visible, but implied by warm light and shadows).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is dominated by cool grays (jets) and warm golds/whites (clouds/sky), with high contrast between sunlight and shadows.\n\n#### **Jets (Foreground and Background)**\n- **Primary Color**: Matte light gunmetal gray (#8C8C8C) for the fuselage, wings, and stabilizers.\n- **Highlights**: Metallic silver (#B0B0B0) on the top surfaces of wings and fuselage, where sunlight hits directly.\n- **Shadows**: Dark gray (#5A5A5A) in panel lines, under wings, and on the undersides of stabilizers.\n- **Cockpit Canopy**: Tinted smoke gray (#4D4D4D) with a subtle reflection of the sky.\n- **Engines**: Brushed aluminum (#A6A6A6) for the casings, with black (#1A1A1A) inside the nozzles.\n\n#### **Decals and Markings (Foreground Jet)**\n- **Tail Fin (Left Vertical Stabilizer)**: A **black shield-shaped decal** with:\n  - White text: \"BLACK ACES 41\" (top) and \"USS ENTERPRISE\" (bottom, smaller).\n  - A small white star in the center of the shield.\n- **Nose Cone**: Bold black text \"101\" with a yellow (#FFD700) outline, centered on the nose.\n- **Fuselage (Left Side, Mid-Section)**: White text \"NAVY\" (capitalized, sans-serif).\n- **Right Wing (Upper Surface)**: U.S. Navy insignia: A white five-pointed star enclosed in a blue (#000080) circle, with a red (#FF0000) stripe across the bottom.\n- **Vertical Stabilizers (Top Edge)**: A thin yellow (#FFD700) stripe (1/10 the height of the fin).\n- **Fuselage (Near Cockpit)**: A small black arrow (pointing toward the nose) and two triangular \"warning\" symbols (gray, 1cm tall) above the wing root.\n- **Wing (Right Side, Underside)**: Small black text \"VF-41\" (squadron designation).\n\n#### **Clouds and Sky**\n- **Clouds**:\n  - **Top Surfaces**: Warm white (#FFFFE0) with golden highlights (#FFD700) from the sun.\n  - **Undersides/Shadows**: Gray (#D3D3D3) with soft transitions to darker gray (#A9A9A9) in dense areas.\n- **Sky**:\n  - **Lower Half**: Deep blue (#00008B) fading to pale blue (#87CEEB) toward the center.\n  - **Upper Half**: Golden gradient (#FFD700 to #FFA500) from the sun’s position (upper right).\n\n#### **Lighting**\n- **Highlights**: Strong golden (#FFD700) light on the top of the foreground jet’s wings, nose, and canopy.\n- **Shadows**: The foreground jet casts a dark gray (#5A5A5A) shadow on the clouds below, matching its outline.\n- **Atmosphere**: A soft haze (pale gold #FFE4B5) surrounds the sun, diffusing light on the background jet.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses **linear perspective** to emphasize depth, with the foreground jet dominating the frame.\n\n#### **Foreground Jet**\n- **Position**: Occupies 70% of the image, centered slightly to the **right of the vertical midline**.\n- **Orientation**: Flying from the **bottom left to top right** (nose tilted up 10° relative to the horizon).\n- **Key Points**:\n  - Nose is at the **upper right corner** of the image.\n  - Tail fin is at the **lower left corner**.\n  - Wings extend from the fuselage: Left wing (jet’s perspective) is on the **image’s left side**, right wing on the **image’s right side**.\n  - The cockpit is positioned 1/4 of the way from the nose to the tail.\n\n#### **Background Jet**\n- **Position**: Upper center of the image, **2x the foreground jet’s length** away from it.\n- **Orientation**: Parallel to the foreground jet (same nose-up angle).\n- **Size**: 1/3 the foreground jet’s length (to convey distance).\n- **Visibility**: Only the nose, wings, and tail are clearly visible (fuselage partially obscured by clouds).\n\n#### **Clouds**\n- **Layer**: Occupies the lower 2/3 of the image, with the foreground jet flying **10–15% above the cloud layer**.\n- **Depth**: Clouds are layered, with the closest clouds (below the foreground jet) in sharp focus and distant clouds (behind the background jet) softer.\n\n#### **Sun**\n- **Position**: Implied at the **upper right corner** (outside the frame).\n- **Effect**: Light travels from the upper right, casting highlights on the top of the jets and clouds, and shadows on their undersides.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic 3D render** with:\n- **High Detail**: Visible panel lines, rivets (subtle, 1mm diameter), and surface textures (brushed metal, matte paint).\n- **Dramatic Lighting**: Golden hour sunlight creates strong contrast between warm highlights and cool shadows, enhancing depth.\n- **Depth of Field**: The foreground jet is in **sharp focus** (all details crisp), while the background jet and distant clouds are slightly **softened** (blur radius: 2–3px) to simulate camera depth.\n- **Atmospheric Perspective**: The sky fades from deep blue (near) to golden (far), and clouds become lighter and more translucent with distance.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text and symbols are **vector-based** (critical for SVG) and positioned with precise alignment:\n\n#### **Foreground Jet**\n- **Tail Fin (Left Vertical Stabilizer)**:\n  - \"BLACK ACES 41\": White, sans-serif, 1.5cm tall, centered on the black shield.\n  - \"USS ENTERPRISE\": White, sans-serif, 0.5cm tall, below \"BLACK ACES 41\".\n- **Nose Cone**: \"101\": Black, bold sans-serif, 3cm tall, with a 0.5cm yellow outline. Centered on the nose, 2cm from the tip.\n- **Fuselage (Left Side)**: \"NAVY\": White, sans-serif, 2cm tall, positioned 1/3 of the way from the nose to the tail, aligned with the wing root.\n- **Right Wing (Upper Surface)**: U.S. Navy Insignia: Star (1cm tall), circle (1.5cm diameter), red stripe (0.2cm tall). Centered on the wing, 1/4 of the way from the fuselage to the wingtip.\n- **Vertical Stabilizers (Top Edge)**: Yellow stripe: 0.1cm tall, running the full width of the fin.\n- **Fuselage (Near Cockpit)**: Black arrow: 1cm long, pointing toward the nose. Positioned 2cm above the wing root, 1/3 of the way from the nose to the tail.\n\n#### **Background Jet**\n- **Tail Fin**: Scaled-down \"BLACK ACES 41\" decal (0.5cm tall text).\n- **Nose Cone**: \"101\" (same design as foreground jet, 1cm tall).\n\n#### **Other Details**\n- **Panel Lines**: Thin (0.1cm) dark gray (#5A5A5A) lines outlining every fuselage and wing panel. Spaced 2–5cm apart, with curved lines following the jet’s contours.\n- **Rivets**: Subtle (0.1cm diameter) gray (#8C8C8C) dots along panel edges (visible only in high-magnification areas like the cockpit and tail).\n- **Canopy Seals**: Thin black (#000000) lines around the canopy edges, 0.05cm tall.\n- **Engine Nozzles**: Metallic silver (#B0B0B0) rims with black (#000000) inner cones.\n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout (Critical for SVG)**\nTo ensure accurate scaling, use the **foreground jet’s length** as the reference (100 units):\n- **Foreground Jet**:\n  - Length (nose to tail): 100 units.\n  - Height (top of canopy to bottom of engines): 20 units.\n  - Wingspan (tip to tip): 60 units.\n  - Vertical Stabilizer Height: 15 units (1/6 the jet’s length).\n- **Background Jet**:\n  - Length: 33 units (1/3 the foreground jet’s length).\n  - Wingspan: 20 units.\n- **Cloud Layer**:\n  - Height (from bottom of image to top of clouds): 60 units.\n  - Foreground Jet Altitude: 10 units above the cloud layer.\n\n\n### **7. SVG-Specific Notes**\n- **Layers**: Organize elements into groups (e.g., \"Foreground Jet\", \"Background Jet\", \"Clouds\", \"Sky\") for easy editing.\n- **Gradients**: Use linear gradients for the sky (blue to gold) and radial gradients for cloud highlights (white to gold).\n- **Clipping Paths**: Use a clipping path for the foreground jet’s shadow on the clouds (matching the jet’s outline, filled with dark gray #5A5A5A at 50% opacity).\n- **Transparency**: The background jet and distant clouds should have 10–20% opacity to simulate depth.\n- **Text**: Convert all text to outlines (paths) to ensure consistency in SVG viewers.\n\n\nThis description provides all the geometric, color, and spatial details needed to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. The focus on proportional accuracy, layer organization, and vector-compatible elements (e.g., text as paths, gradients) ensures the final product will match the original image’s realism and detail.",
  "v1_31": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into geometric shapes, colors, textures, spatial relationships, and stylistic elements—all critical for vector-based recreation.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a perspective view of a desert road scene with three key foreground/medium-ground elements (a man, a car, a cyclist) and two background elements (a rocky hillside, a stone retaining wall). The sky dominates the upper third.\n\n#### **Foreground: Man**\n- **Body**: Composed of geometric primitives:  \n  - **Head**: Oval (1:1.2 ratio, ~50px × 60px) with short, dark hair (irregular polygon).  \n  - **Torso**: Rectangle (80px × 100px) in a loose white t-shirt.  \n  - **Arms**: Two rectangles (20px × 50px) crossed at the wrists in front of the torso.  \n  - **Legs**: Two rectangles (30px × 100px) in medium-blue jeans, standing straight.  \n  - **Sunglasses**: Two ovals (15px × 5px) with a 5px-wide bridge (black frames).  \n  - **Fanny Pack**: Rectangle (60px × 20px) wrapped around the waist (dark gray/black).  \n- **Position**: Standing on a **stone curb** (see below) at the left edge of the image, 50px from the left and 100px from the bottom.  \n\n#### **Road & Infrastructure**\n- **Road**: Trapezoid shape (wider in the foreground, narrower in the distance) with asphalt texture. Key lines:  \n  - **Center Line**: Solid yellow (traffic yellow, #FFD700) straight line converging to a **vanishing point** (500px × 400px, horizon line).  \n  - **Edge Lines**: White (solid) straight lines parallel to the center line, defining the road’s boundaries.  \n- **Curb**: Raised stone edge (parallel to the road) separating the man from the road. Rectangle (10px × 800px) with irregular stone texture.  \n- **Retaining Wall**: Long, low stone wall (100px tall × 800px wide) running along the **right side of the road** (parallel to the curb). Composed of irregular polygons (stones) in varying sizes.  \n\n#### **Medium Ground: Road Users**\n- **White Car**: Rectangular body (50px × 20px) with a slanted windshield (45° angle), two small rectangular windows (10px × 5px), and four circular wheels (10px diameter, black). Positioned **on the right side of the center line**, 600px from the left and 300px from the bottom (smaller due to perspective).  \n- **Cyclist**: Small human figure on a road bike:  \n  - **Body**: Oval (10px × 15px) for the torso, two rectangles (5px × 10px) for legs (bent at the knees), two rectangles (5px × 5px) for arms (leaning forward).  \n  - **Bike**: Triangle (20px × 10px) for the frame, two circular wheels (8px diameter), drop handlebars (small rectangle).  \n  - **Position**: Between the center line and right edge line, **ahead of the car** (500px from the left, 250px from the bottom).  \n\n#### **Background**\n- **Rocky Hillside**: Irregular polygon covering the right half of the image (from the retaining wall to the top). Texture: Rocky with patches of sparse vegetation (small green polygons).  \n- **Sky**: Large rectangle (1000px × 200px) covering the upper third of the image. Solid, cloudless blue.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified using hex codes for consistency. Textures are described as vector patterns or gradients.\n\n| Element               | Color(s)                                  | Texture/Visual Property                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Man**               | T-shirt: #FFFFFF (white); Jeans: #4682B4 (medium blue); Fanny pack: #2F4F4F (dark gray); Hair: #000000 (black); Sunglasses: #000000 (black) | T-shirt: Smooth; Jeans: Denim (small diagonal lines); Fanny pack: Matte.                |\n| **Road**              | Asphalt: #808080 (medium gray); Center line: #FFD700 (traffic yellow); Edge lines: #FFFFFF (white) | Asphalt: Rough (small noise pattern); Lines: Solid, crisp.                              |\n| **Curb/Retaining Wall** | Stones: #A9A9A9 (dark gray), #D3D3D3 (light gray), #8B4513 (brown) | Irregular stone pattern (varying polygon sizes/colors); Rough, matte.                   |\n| **Car**               | Body: #FFFFFF (white); Wheels: #000000 (black); Windows: #808080 (gray) | Smooth, reflective (slight gradient on body); Wheels: Matte.                            |\n| **Cyclist**           | Torso: #FFFFFF (white); Legs/Arms: #000000 (black); Helmet: #000000 (black); Bike frame: #808080 (gray) | Smooth; Bike: Metallic (subtle gradient).                                               |\n| **Hillside**          | Rocks: #696969 (dark gray), #A9A9A9 (medium gray); Vegetation: #2E8B57 (sea green) | Rocky (irregular polygons); Vegetation: Sparse (small, scattered green patches).        |\n| **Sky**               | #87CEEB (sky blue)                         | Smooth, solid (no gradient—clear, cloudless).                                            |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition follows **linear perspective**, with all road lines converging to a **vanishing point** at (500px, 400px) (horizon line). Key spatial rules:  \n- **Foreground**: The man is the largest element (200px tall), positioned at the left edge (50px from the left, 100px from the bottom).  \n- **Medium Ground**: The car and cyclist are smaller (50px × 20px and 30px × 15px, respectively) due to distance. The cyclist is **ahead of the car** (closer to the viewer) and centered on the road; the car is offset to the right.  \n- **Background**: The retaining wall runs parallel to the road, merging with the hillside at the horizon line. The hillside rises from the wall to the top of the image, framing the right side.  \n- **Sky**: Occupies the upper third (200px tall), with the horizon line at 400px from the bottom.  \n\n#### **Perspective Guidelines**\n- **Road Width**: 500px at the bottom (foreground) narrowing to 100px at the horizon (vanishing point).  \n- **Center Line**: Starts at 500px wide (bottom) and tapers to a point at the vanishing point.  \n- **Retaining Wall**: 100px tall at the bottom, shrinking to 50px tall at the horizon (perspective shrinkage).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph**, but the SVG should mimic this with:  \n- **Linear Perspective**: Strict adherence to the vanishing point for all road-related elements (lines, wall, curb).  \n- **Textured Realism**: Vector patterns (e.g., stone, asphalt) to replicate real-world textures without raster images.  \n- **Depth Cues**: Size variation (man > car > cyclist), overlapping (hillside behind wall), and color saturation (sky is brighter than the hillside).  \n- **Simplification**: Minor details (e.g., car license plates, man’s facial features) are omitted due to scale, but key shapes (e.g., sunglasses, bike frame) are preserved.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No Visible Text**: The image contains no readable text (e.g., signs, license plates) due to scale.  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - **Cyclist’s Helmet**: Oval shape (10px × 5px) on the head, emphasizing safety (critical for recognition).  \n  - **Car’s Windshield**: Slanted rectangle (45°) to indicate direction (facing away from the viewer).  \n- **Minor Details**:  \n  - The man’s arms are **crossed** (rectangles overlapping at the wrists).  \n  - The cyclist is leaning forward (arms bent, torso angled) to suggest movement.  \n  - The retaining wall has **irregularly stacked stones** (no uniform pattern) for a natural look.  \n  - The hillside has **random green patches** (10px × 10px polygons) to indicate sparse vegetation.  \n\n\n### **SVG-Specific Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following vector techniques:  \n- **Groups**: Organize elements into layers (e.g., `sky`, `hillside`, `road`, `man`, `car`).  \n- **Gradients**: Use linear gradients for the hillside (dark gray at the bottom, light gray at the top) to add depth.  \n- **Patterns**: Create a `stone-pattern` (irregular polygons in gray/brown) for the curb and retaining wall. Reuse this pattern to maintain consistency.  \n- **Clipping Paths**: Use a clipping path for the hillside to mask it behind the retaining wall.  \n- **Stroke Widths**:  \n  - Road lines: 2px (yellow center line), 1px (white edge lines).  \n  - Man’s sunglasses: 1px stroke (black).  \n  - Bike frame: 1px stroke (gray).  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, perspective, and visual质感 (texture) while remaining editable and scalable.",
  "v1_32": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we’ll break down its structure, elements, and visual properties in detail. The design is a **3x3 grid of bread-making steps** with a minimalist, flat-style aesthetic, using soft pastels and hand-drawn text. Below is a comprehensive breakdown:\n\n\n### **1. Grid Structure & Layout**\nThe image is a **3-row × 3-column grid** with equal-sized square cells (1:1 aspect ratio). Each cell has a **light beige background** (#f8f0e8), except the **center cell** (2nd row, 2nd column), which has a **white background** (#ffffff).

Cell-by-Cell Breakdown**\nEach cell contains a **step illustration** and **hand-drawn text**. Below is a detailed description of each cell, including elements, colors, positioning, and text.\n\n\n#### **Row 1, Column 1: Mixing Ingredients**\n**Background**: Light beige (#f8f0e8)  \n**Main Elements**:  \n- **Blue mixing bowl**: Solid blue (#6495ed) with a light gray interior (#d3d3d3).

SVG-Specific Notes**\nTo recreate the image accurately in SVG:  \n- **Shapes**: Use `<path>` elements for all elements (e.g., the blue bowl is a rounded rectangle with a curved top).  \n- **Text**: Convert all text to `<path>` elements to maintain the hand-drawn look (avoid using `<text>` tags).  \n- **Textures**: Add subtle textures as separate paths (e.g., white dots on dough, brown spots on bread).  \n- **Steam**: Use `<line>` elements with a `stroke` of #e0e0e0 and `opacity=\"0.3\"` for a soft, airy effect.  \n- **Spacing**: Ensure 10px white spacing between cells using `<rect>` elements for the grid background.  \n- **Alignment**: Use `transform=\"translate(x,y)\"` to center elements within cells.  \n\n\n### **7. Example SVG Code Snippet (Row 1, Column 1)**\n```svg\n<svg width=\"300\" height=\"300\" viewBox=\"0 0 300 300\">\n  <!-- Beige background -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" fill=\"#f8f0e8\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Blue mixing bowl -->\n  <path d=\"M50 150 Q150 200 250 150 V250 Q150 280 50 250 Z\" fill=\"#6495ed\"/>\n  <path d=\"M60 160 Q150 210 240 160 V240 Q150 270 60 240 Z\" fill=\"#d3d3d3\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Whisk -->\n  <path d=\"M100 50 V120 Q100 130 110 130 Q120 130 120 120 V50\" fill=\"#e34234\"/>\n  <path d=\"M110 130 Q130 140 150 130 Q170 140 190 130\" fill=\"#c0c0c0\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Measuring cup (pouring water) -->\n  <path d=\"M30 50 Q50 30 70 50 V100 Q50 120 30 100 Z\" fill=\"#6495ed\"/>\n  <path d=\"M60 70 Q80 80 100 90\" fill=\"#add8e6\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Spoons -->\n  <path d=\"M80 80 Q90 70 100 80 V100\" fill=\"#c0c0c0\"/>\n  <text x=\"85\" y=\"75\" font-size=\"18\" fill=\"#8b4513\">YEAST</text>\n  \n  <path d=\"M220 80 Q230 70 240 80 V100\" fill=\"#6495ed\"/>\n  <text x=\"215\" y=\"75\" font-size=\"18\" fill=\"#8b4513\">SUGAR</text>\n  \n  <!-- Text -->\n  <text x=\"20\" y=\"40\" font-size=\"18\" fill=\"#8b4513\">WATER</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **8. Final Checks for SVG**\n- **Responsiveness**: Use `viewBox` attributes to ensure the image scales correctly.  \n- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform line weights (1px) and color palettes across all elements.  \n- **Accessibility**: Add `alt` text for screen readers (e.g., \"Step 1: Mixing water, yeast, and sugar in a bowl\").  \n\nThis detailed breakdown provides all the information needed to recreate the image as an accurate, high-quality SVG. The key is to focus on **consistent proportions**, **solid colors**, and **simplified shapes** to match the original design’s minimalist, friendly aesthetic.",

Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Title**  \n- **Text**: \"HOW TO COOK OMELETTE\"  \n- **Style**: Bold, uppercase, sans-serif (e.g., Arial Black), 48px, white.  \n- **Position**: Centered at the top (x: 400px, y: 50px).  \n\n#### **Step Labels**  \nAll labels are **uppercase, 16px, sans-serif**, centered below their respective circles:  \n1. \"BEAT EGGS WITH SALT\"  \n2. \"HEAT BUTTER IN FRYING PAN\"  \n3. \"POUR EGGS INTO PAN\"  \n4. \"TILT PAN SLIGHTLY\"  \n5. \"CUT HERBS, SAUSAGE AND MUSHROOMS\"  \n6. \"FILL OMELETTE WITH INGREDIENTS\"  \n7. \"FOLD IN HALF USING SPATULA\"  \n8. \"ENJOY!\"  \n\n#### **Icon Details (Geometric Precision)**  \n- **Bowl (Steps 1, 3)**: 60px diameter circle (light gray #E0E0E0), no stroke.  \n- **Whisk (Step 1)**: Red handle (15px × 5px rectangle, #F44336) + 3 silver wires (10px long, #BDBDBD) forming a \"W\" shape.  \n- **Eggs (Step 1)**:  \n  - Whole: 30px × 20px oval (yellow #FFEB3B), white shell (1px stroke, #FFFFFF).  \n  - Cracked: Same oval with a 5px \"break\" in the shell (stroke removed), yolk (15px circle, #FFC107).  \n- **Salt Shaker (Step 1)**: 20px tall cylinder (silver #BDBDBD) + 5px white cap (#FFFFFF).  \n- **Frying Pan (Steps 2–4, 6–7)**:  \n  - Pan body: 70px × 40px rectangle (black #000000) with rounded edges (10px radius).  \n  - Handle: 30px × 5px rectangle (silver #BDBDBD), attached to the right side.  \n- **Butter (Step 2)**: 15px circle (yellow #FFEB3B), centered in the pan.  \n- **Heat Lines (Step 2)**: 3 wavy red lines (#F44336) below the pan, each 20px long.  \n- **Tilted Pan (Step 4)**: Pan rotated 30° clockwise, egg mixture (80px × 10px rectangle, yellow #FFEB3B) spread to the right.  \n- **Cutting Board (Step 5)**: 70px × 50px rectangle (brown #795548) with rounded corners (10px radius).  \n- **Knife (Step 5)**:  \n  - Blade: 40px × 5px rectangle (silver #BDBDBD), pointed at the end.  \n  - Handle: 20px × 5px rectangle (brown #795548), attached to the blade.  \n- **Ingredients (Steps 5–6)**:  \n  - Herbs: 3 leaf shapes (10px × 5px, green #4CAF50), pointed at the ends.  \n  - Sausage: 3 10px circles (pink #FFCDD2) with 1px brown borders (#8D6E63).  \n  - Mushrooms: 2 15px semicircles (brown #795548) with white gills (3 5px lines, #FFFFFF).  \n- **Spatula (Step 7)**:  \n  - Blade: 30px × 10px rectangle (silver #BDBDBD), curved at the end.  \n  - Handle: 20px × 5px rectangle (brown #795548), attached to the blade.  \n- **Plate (Step 8)**: 80px diameter circle (blue #2196F3) + 5px white rim (#FFFFFF).  \n- **Omelette (Step 8)**: 60px semicircle (yellow #FFEB3B), centered on the plate, with 1 sausage slice and 1 mushroom visible.  \n- **Steam (Step 8)**: 3 wavy white lines (#FFFFFF) above the plate, each 20px long.  \n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Notes for Recreation**\n- **Shapes**: Use `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<ellipse>`, and `<path>` for custom shapes (e.g., herbs, steam).  \n- **Strokes**: All icons use 1px strokes unless specified (e.g., circle borders are 2px).  \n- **Groups**: Organize each step (circle + icon + text) into a `<g>` element for easy repositioning.  \n- **Text**: Use `<text>` elements with `font-family: Arial, sans-serif` for consistency.  \n- **Scalability**: Ensure all elements are defined with relative units (e.g., percentages) or fixed units (px) for consistent sizing.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. The flat design and grid layout make it easy to adjust for different screen sizes while maintaining clarity.",
  "v1_35": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this homemade baguette recipe illustration, below is a **comprehensive, technical description** organized by the user’s specified focus areas. The details include geometric shapes, color values, spatial layout, text placement, and artistic style—all critical for precise recreation.\n\n\n## **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **step-by-step recipe card** with a warm, hand-drawn aesthetic. The primary structure is a **2-row × 3-column grid** for 6 steps, topped by a decorative banner and a small baguette icon. Key elements per section:\n\n### **Top Banner & Header**\n- **Banner**: A curved, teal ribbon with rounded ends and a central \"fold\" (creating two \"tails\" on the left/right). The ribbon spans ~70% of the image width.\n- **Header Text**: *\"Homemade baguette\"* (handwritten, centered on the ribbon).\n- **Baguette Icon**: A small, elongated oval (representing a baked baguette) with 3 diagonal slashes (score marks) on top. Flanked by 2 sets of 3 short, parallel lines (indicating \"steam\" or freshness).\n\n### **Step Grid (2 Rows × 3 Columns)**\nEach step has a **circular number badge** (1–6) followed by a title, bullet-point ingredients/tools, and illustrative icons. The grid columns are evenly spaced, with consistent padding between elements.\n\n#### **Row 1 (Steps 1–3)**\n- **Step 1 (Top Left)**:  \n  Title: *\"1. Pour into a larger bowl:\"*  \n  Bullet points (with icons to the right):  \n  - *\"200 ml of lukewarm water\"* → Teal measuring cup (cylinder with a handle, tapered top).  \n  - *\"1 tablespoon of sugar\"* → Wooden spoon (oval bowl, long handle) with a small pile of sugar.  \n  - *\"10 g of dry yeast\"* → Small brown yeast packet (rectangle with a top flap, plus a tiny yeast icon).  \n\n- **Step 2 (Top Middle)**:  \n  Title: *\"2. After 5 minutes, add:\"*  \n  Bullet points (with icons to the right):  \n  - *\"50 ml of olive oil\"* → Teal oil bottle (cylinder with a narrow neck) with brown liquid inside, flanked by 3 olives and a sprig of leaves.  \n  - *\"2 tablespoon of yogurt\"* → Mint-green pitcher (cylinder with a handle) with white yogurt inside.  \n  - *\"1 teaspoon of salt\"* → Small silver teaspoon (oval bowl, short handle) with a pinch of salt.  \n\n- **Step 3 (Top Right)**:  \n  Title: *\"3. Add 350 g of all purpose flour\"*  \n  Subtitle: *\"Knead for a few minutes to get a smooth dough\"*  \n  Icons:  \n  - Brown flour bag (rectangle with a top opening) with white flour spilling out.  \n  - Hands kneading dough (two line-art hands, palms down, pressing a pale oval dough).  \n\n#### **Row 2 (Steps 4–6)**\n- **Step 4 (Bottom Left)**:  \n  Title: *\"4. Cover with a kitchen towel and leave for half an hour\"*  \n  Icon: Teal bowl (semicircle) covered by a **red towel with white polka dots** (rectangle with rounded edges, evenly spaced dots).  \n\n- **Step 5 (Bottom Middle)**:  \n  Title: *\"5. Shape the baguette, place in a baking tray and leave for another hour and a half to rise\"*  \n  Icon: White baking tray (long rectangle with rounded edges) holding a pale, elongated dough (oval shape).  \n\n- **Step 6 (Bottom Right)**:  \n  Title: *\"6. Bake in a preheated oven at 230 degrees for approximately 20-30 minutes and it's ready baked bread\"*  \n  Icon: Red baking tray (same shape as Step 5) holding a **baked baguette** (brown oval with 3 diagonal score marks on top).  \n\n\n## **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **soft, warm, and minimalistic** with flat colors (no complex shading) and subtle gradients for depth. Below are key color values (hex codes for SVG):  \n- **Background**: Warm beige (#E8D5B7).  \n- **Banner**: Teal (#81C784) with a slight gradient (lighter in the center for a \"fold\" effect).  \n- **Text**: Black (#000000), handwritten in a casual, organic font (e.g., \"Amatic SC\" or similar).  \n- **Measuring Cups/Pitchers**:  \n  - Lukewarm water (Step 1): Teal (#81C784) with a lighter teal interior (#B2EBF2).  \n  - Yogurt (Step 2): Mint-green (#B2EBF2) with a white interior (#FFFFFF).  \n- **Ingredient Icons**:  \n  - Sugar (Step 1): Pale yellow (#FFF3CD).  \n  - Yeast packet (Step 1): Brown (#8B4513) with a yellow yeast icon (#FFD700).  \n  - Olive oil (Step 2): Brown liquid (#8B4513) with green olives (#6B8E23).  \n  - Flour (Step 3): Brown bag (#8B4513) with white flour (#F5F5F5).  \n  - Dough (Step 3/5): Pale yellow (#FFF3CD).  \n- **Towel (Step 4)**: Red (#FF0000) with white polka dots (#FFFFFF).  \n- **Baguettes**:  \n  - Top header: Light brown (#A16E48).  \n  - Baked (Step 6): Darker brown (#8B4513) with black score marks (#000000).  \n- **Baking Trays**:  \n  - Unbaked (Step 5): White (#FFFFFF).  \n  - Baked (Step 6): Red (#FF0000).  \n\n**Textures**:  \n- Flat, matte finish (no gloss).  \n- Subtle gradients: Measuring cups/pitchers have lighter interiors to suggest volume.  \n- Pattern: The Step 4 towel has evenly spaced white polka dots (10px diameter, 20px apart).  \n\n\n## **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is a **grid-based design** with consistent spacing to ensure balance. Key positional details:  \n- **Banner**: Centered at the top, spanning ~70% of the image width (e.g., 600px wide in an 800px image).  \n- **Header Baguette**: Centered below the banner, smaller than the Step 6 baguette (e.g., 200px wide vs. 120px for Step 6).  \n- **Step Grid**:  \n  - **Row 1 (Steps 1–3)**: Top row, starting at 150px from the top. Each step column is 260px wide (800px total width ÷ 3 columns = ~266px, adjusted for 20px gaps).  \n  - **Row 2 (Steps 4–6)**: Bottom row, starting at 370px from the top (20px gap from Row 1).  \n- **Icons**: Aligned to the **right of each bullet point** (Step 1–2) or centered below the step title (Steps 3–6).  \n- **Text**:  \n  - Step titles (e.g., \"1. Pour into a larger bowl:\") are left-aligned, bold, and slightly larger than bullet points.  \n  - Bullet points are left-aligned with icons to the right (e.g., \"200 ml of lukewarm water\" → measuring cup).  \n  - Subtitles (e.g., \"Knead for a few minutes...\") are left-aligned below step titles, smaller than titles.  \n\n### **Proportions**\n- **Banner**: Height = 80px, width = 600px (2/3 of the image width).  \n- **Measuring Cups/Pitchers**: ~60px wide × 40px tall (Step 1 cup) / 50px wide × 30px tall (Step 2 pitcher).  \n- **Spoons**: ~80px long × 15px wide (Step 1 tablespoon) / 50px long × 10px wide (Step 2 teaspoon).  \n- **Baguettes**:  \n  - Header: 200px wide × 40px tall.  \n  - Step 6: 120px wide × 30px tall (larger to emphasize the final product).  \n- **Baking Trays**: 120px wide × 20px tall (Step 5) / 120px wide × 30px tall (Step 6, to hold the larger baguette).  \n\n\n## **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe style is **cute, illustrative, and folk-art inspired** with:  \n- **Flat Design**: No 3D effects or complex shading—only subtle gradients for depth (e.g., measuring cup interiors).  \n- **Line Art**: Thin, black outlines for icons (e.g., hands, baguette score marks) and text.  \n- **Organic Shapes**: Rounded edges on all objects (e.g., banner, measuring cups, baking trays) for a friendly feel.  \n- **Handwritten Text**: Casual, uneven font (not perfectly straight) to mimic a hand-drawn recipe card.  \n- **Minimalism**: No unnecessary details (e.g., hands have no finger details, yeast packets have a simple icon).  \n\n\n## **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n### **Text**\nAll text is **handwritten in black (#000000)** with the following hierarchy:  \n- **Step Titles**: Bold, larger font (e.g., 16px) for clarity (e.g., \"1. Pour into a larger bowl:\").  \n- **Bullet Points**: Regular, smaller font (e.g., 12px) for ingredients (e.g., \"*200 ml of lukewarm water*\").  \n- **Subtitles**: Regular, smaller font (e.g., 10px) for instructions (e.g., \"*Knead for a few minutes to get a smooth dough*\").  \n\n### **Symbols**\n- **Number Badges**: Circular, white (#FFFFFF) background with a black border (#000000) and black text (#000000). Positioned to the **left of each step title** (e.g., Step 1 badge is 20px × 20px, 10px from the left edge of the column).  \n- **Ingredient Icons**: Visual metaphors for clarity (e.g., olives next to olive oil, flour bag next to flour).  \n- **Score Marks**: 3 diagonal lines on the baguette (Step 6) to indicate traditional baking cuts.  \n\n### **Specific Details**\n- **Yeast Packet**: Small rectangle (30px × 20px) with a top flap and a tiny yeast icon (yellow circle with a \"Y\" or yeast cell shape).  \n- **Olives (Step 2)**: 3 green circles (#6B8E23) with brown stems (#8B4513), positioned next to the olive oil bottle.  \n- **Towel (Step 4)**: Red rectangle (#FF0000) with 10px white dots (#FFFFFF), evenly spaced (20px apart) to cover the bowl.  \n- **Hands (Step 3)**: Line-art hands (no finger details) pressing a pale dough (oval shape, 100px wide × 40px tall).  \n\n\n## **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these technical specifications for SVG:  \n- **Grid Layout**: Use a **2-row × 3-column flex container** with `justify-content: space-between` to evenly space steps.  \n- **Shapes**:  \n  - **Banner**: Draw a rectangle with rounded ends (#81C784), then add two smaller rectangles (tails) on either side for the \"fold\" effect.  \n  - **Measuring Cups**: Use `<rect>` for the body, `<path>` for the handle, and `<rect>` for the interior (lighter gradient).  \n  - **Baguette Score Marks**: Use `<line>` elements (3 diagonal lines) for the Step 6 baguette.  \n- **Text**: Embed the handwritten font (e.g., \"Amatic SC\") and use `<text>` elements with `font-family` specified.  \n- **Patterns**: Use `<pattern>` for the Step 4 towel (white dots on red background) and apply it to the towel `<rect>`.  \n- **Gradients**: Use `<linearGradient>` for the banner (lighter center) and measuring cups (lighter interior).  \n\n### **Example SVG Snippets**\n- **Banner**:  \n  ```svg\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"20\" width=\"600\" height=\"80\" rx=\"20\" ry=\"20\" fill=\"#81C784\">\n    <linearGradient id=\"banner-gradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"1\" y2=\"0\">\n      <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#81C784\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"0.5\" stop-color=\"#90EE90\"/>\n      <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#81C784\"/>\n    </linearGradient>\n    <text x=\"350\" y=\"60\" font-family=\"Amatic SC\" font-size=\"32\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Homemade baguette</text>\n  </rect>\n  ```\n- **Step 4 Towel**:  \n  ```svg\n  <pattern id=\"polka-dots\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n    <circle cx=\"10\" cy=\"10\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n  </pattern>\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"450\" width=\"80\" height=\"60\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#FF0000\" fill-opacity=\"0.8\" pattern=\"url(#polka-dots)\"/>\n  ```\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the original image’s charm, layout, and technical specifications.",
  "v1_36": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this pancake recipe infographic, below is a detailed, structured description covering all critical elements—**main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and text/symbols**. The design follows a **flat, minimalistic cartoon style** with bold colors, clean lines, and a 3x3 grid layout of step-by-step circles.\n\n\n## **1. Overall Layout & Spatial Relationships**\nThe image is a **3-column × 3-row grid** of numbered circular steps (1–9) centered on a soft peach background. A title sits at the top, and a copyright bar runs along the bottom. Key spatial rules:  \n- **Circles**: 9 equal-sized white circles (≈150px diameter, 2px rounded edges) with a subtle 1px gray drop shadow. They are evenly spaced (≈20px gap between circles) and aligned in a perfect grid.  \n- **Title**: Centered above the top row of circles.  \n- **Copyright Bar**: A black rectangle spanning the full width of the image (≈50px height) at the bottom.  \n- **Numbering**: Each circle has a small orange number (1–9) in the **top-left corner** (≈12px font size).  \n\n\n## **2. Background & Textures**\n- **Primary Background**: Solid soft peach (#F8D7C8) with faint, repeated \"alamy\" watermarks (light gray, #D3D3D3) in a sans-serif font. The watermarks are subtle and do not interfere with the main content.  \n- **Circle Backgrounds**: Solid white (#FFFFFF) with a 1px light gray (#E0E0E0) border (optional, but visible in the original).  \n- **Textures**: No realistic textures—all objects use flat colors with minimal depth (subtle drop shadows for dimensionality).  \n\n\n## **3. Title & Text**\n### **Main Title**  \n- **Text**: \"Pancake recipe\"  \n- **Style**: Handwritten, playful font (similar to \"Pacifico\" or \"Comic Sans\" but more refined).  \n- **Color**: Bright red (#E63946).  \n- **Position**: Centered horizontally above the top row of circles (≈50px from the top edge).  \n- **Size**: ≈48px (larger than the step numbers, dominant visual element).  \n\n### **Step Numbers**  \n- **Text**: 1–9 (one per circle)  \n- **Style**: Sans-serif (e.g., \"Arial\"), bold.  \n- **Color**: Orange (#FF9800).  \n- **Position**: Top-left corner of each circle (≈10px from the top and left edges).  \n- **Size**: ≈14px (small, unobtrusive).  \n\n### **Copyright Bar**  \n- **Background**: Solid black (#000000).  \n- **Text**:  \n  - Left: \"alamy\" (white, #FFFFFF, sans-serif, ≈24px).  \n  - Right: \"Image ID: 2GY9YMY\" and \"www.alamy.com\" (white, #FFFFFF, sans-serif, ≈12px).  \n- **Position**: Spans the full width of the image (100% width) at the bottom (≈50px height).  \n\n\n## **4.

Arrows (Process Flow)**\nArrows connect the steps in the order:  \n**Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Step 4 → Step 5**  \nAll arrows are **white** (`#FFFFFF`), with a `stroke-width: 8px` (no fill) and triangular arrowheads (`16px` tall × `12px` wide).\n\n| Arrow Path | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| **Step 1 → Step 2** | Straight horizontal line from the **right edge** of the green circle (`325, 250`) to the **left edge** of the sky blue circle (`525, 250`). |\n| **Step 2 → Step 3** | Straight horizontal line from the **right edge** of the sky blue circle (`675, 250`) to the **left edge** of the red circle (`875, 250`). |\n| **Step 3 → Step 4** | Curved line from the **bottom edge** of the red circle (`950, 325`) to the **top edge** of the yellow circle (`750, 525`).<br>- **Control Points**: `(1050, 450)` (right curve) and `(850, 500)` (left curve) to create a smooth arc. |\n| **Step 4 → Step 5** | Straight horizontal line from the **left edge** of the yellow circle (`675, 600`) to the **right edge** of the light blue circle (`525, 600`). |\n\n\n### **5. Branding (Frevvo Logo)**\n- **Content**: **\"frevvo\"** (lowercase, minimal stylization).\n- **Position**: Bottom-right corner, centered at `(1100, 750)` (100px from the right edge, 50px from the bottom edge).\n- **Typography**: \n  - Font: Sans-serif (matches the title, e.g., Arial).\n  - Size: `36px` (subtle, not dominant).\n  - Color: White (`#FFFFFF`).\n- **Style**: Minimalist—slight curve on the top of the \"f\" and a gentle angle on the \"v\" for brand recognition.\n\n\n### **6. Visual Hierarchy & Style**\n- **Flat Design**: No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects—all elements use solid fills and clean lines.\n- **Color Contrast**: Bold, high-contrast colors (deep blue background + bright accent circles) ensure readability and focus.\n- **Icon Simplicity**: Icons are \"universal\" (e.g., clipboard = list, target = objectives) to avoid ambiguity.\n- **Text Hierarchy**: \n  - Title: Largest, boldest (dominant).\n  - Step Labels: Medium size (secondary).\n  - \"SOP\" Text: Bold, larger than labels (draws attention to the final step).\n  - Logo: Smallest (subtle branding).\n\n\n### **7. SVG-Specific Technical Specifications**\nTo ensure accurate reproduction, use these values in your SVG code:\n\n| Element | SVG Attributes |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Canvas** | `<svg viewBox=\"0 0 1200 800\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">` |\n| **Background** | `<rect width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" fill=\"#00529B\"/>` |\n| **Title** | `<text x=\"600\" y=\"80\" font-size=\"48px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">5 STEPS TO WRITING AN SOP</text>` |\n| **Green Circle (Step 1)** | `<circle cx=\"250\" cy=\"250\" r=\"75\" fill=\"#2ECC71\"/>` |\n| **Sky Blue Circle (Step 2)** | `<circle cx=\"600\" cy=\"250\" r=\"75\" fill=\"#3498DB\"/>` |\n| **Red Circle (Step 3)** | `<circle cx=\"950\" cy=\"250\" r=\"75\" fill=\"#E74C3C\"/>` |\n| **Yellow Circle (Step 4)** | `<circle cx=\"750\" cy=\"600\" r=\"75\" fill=\"#F1C40F\"/>` |\n| **Light Blue Circle (Step 5)** | `<circle cx=\"450\" cy=\"600\" r=\"75\" fill=\"#2980B9\"/>` |\n| **Arrow (Step 1→2)** | `<line x1=\"325\" y1=\"250\" x2=\"525\" y2=\"250\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"8\"/>` + `<polygon points=\"525,242 510,250 525,258\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>` (arrowhead) |\n| **Curved Arrow (Step 3→4)** | `<path d=\"M950 325 C1050 450, 850 500, 750 525\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"8\" fill=\"none\"/>` + `<polygon points=\"750,517 735,525 750,533\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>` (arrowhead) |\n| **Frevvo Logo** | `<text x=\"1100\" y=\"750\" font-size=\"36px\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">frevvo</text>` |\n\n\n### **7. Key Notes for Accuracy**\n- **Circle Sizes**: All circles must be identical in diameter (`150px`) to maintain consistency.\n- **Arrow Placement**: Arrows must connect to the **edges** of the circles (not the centers) to avoid overlapping.\n- **Icon Centering**: Use `text-anchor=\"middle\"` for text icons (e.g., \"SOP\") and `transform=\"translate()\"` for graphic icons (e.g., clipboard) to ensure perfect centering.\n- **Color Consistency**: Use the exact hex codes provided—even minor color variations can alter the infographic’s tone.\n\nBy following these specifications, the SVG will be a pixel-accurate reproduction of the original image, with clear process flow, strong branding, and optimal readability.",

Technical Specifications for SVG**  \nTo ensure accuracy in reproduction, below are key technical details for each element:  \n\n### **Text**  \n- **Fonts**: Use web-safe sans-serif fonts (e.g., *Arial*, *Verdana*) to avoid rendering issues.  \n- **Text Elements**: Keep text as `<text>` nodes (not converted to paths) for editability.  \n- **Alignment**: All titles and body text are **centered** in their containers.  \n\n### **Shapes**  \n- **Rectangles**: Use `<rect>` with `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and `rx`/`ry` for rounded corners.  \n- **Circles**: Use `<circle>` with `cx`, `cy`, and `r`.  \n- **Polygons**: Use `<polygon>` with `points` to define irregular shapes (e.g., puzzle pieces, brain).  \n- **Borders**: Use `stroke` and `stroke-width` attributes (e.g., `stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"` for cell borders).  \n\n### **Colors**  \n- **Fill**: Use hex codes for all solid colors (e.g., `fill=\"#F8D7DA\"` for the top-left cell background).  \n- **Transparency**: No transparency—all elements are opaque.  \n\n### **Positioning**  \n- **Grid Cells**: Calculate `x` and `y` positions for each cell using the grid size (250px per cell). For example:  \n  - Top-left cell: `x=\"25px\" y=\"100px\"` (25px margin from left, 100px from top).  \n  - Top-middle cell: `x=\"275px\" y=\"100px\"` (250px + 25px margin).  \n  - Top-right cell: `x=\"525px\" y=\"100px\"` (500px + 25px margin).  \n- **Icons**: Center icons using `transform=\"translate(cx, cy)\"` where `cx` and `cy` are the cell’s center coordinates.  \n\n### **Example SVG Snippet (Top-Left Cell)**  \n```svg\n<!-- Top-Left Cell: \"Make Lists\" -->\n<rect x=\"25\" y=\"100\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" fill=\"#F8D7DA\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n<text x=\"150\" y=\"130\" font-size=\"20\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"Arial\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Make Lists</text>\n<g transform=\"translate(150, 225)\"> <!-- Center icon -->\n  <rect x=\"-75\" y=\"-90\" width=\"150\" height=\"180\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\" rx=\"5\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"-50\" cy=\"-85\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"-25\" cy=\"-85\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"0\" cy=\"-85\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <line x1=\"-50\" y1=\"-85\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"-85\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"0\" y=\"-70\" font-size=\"14\" font-family=\"Arial\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">TO DO LIST</text>\n  <line x1=\"-60\" y1=\"-50\" x2=\"60\" y2=\"-50\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"-60\" y1=\"-30\" x2=\"60\" y2=\"-30\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"-60\" y1=\"-10\" x2=\"60\" y2=\"-10\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"-60\" y1=\"10\" x2=\"60\" y2=\"10\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"-60\" y1=\"30\" x2=\"60\" y2=\"30\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n</g>\n```\n\n\n## **6. Final Checks**  \n- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the SVG scales correctly by using relative units (e.g., `%` for width/height) or setting a `viewBox` (e.g., `viewBox=\"0 0 800 1000\"`).  \n- **Accessibility**: Add `alt` text to icons and `title` attributes to text elements for screen readers.  \n- **Consistency**: Verify that all cell borders, icon sizes, and text styles are uniform across the grid.  \n\nBy following this detailed description, you can recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG suitable for educational materials, websites, or print. The layout is organized, the colors are calming, and the icons are instantly recognizable—making it an effective tool for teaching working memory strategies.",
  "v1_42": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its structure, elements, and design. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requested focus areas, including critical geometric and layout details.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **vertical bar graph** comparing the total fueling costs of three vehicles. Key elements include:  \n- **Three vertical rectangular bars**: Representing fueling costs for the Ford F150 (Regular Cab), Toyota RAV4, and Honda Civic.  \n- **Text elements**:  \n  - **Data values**: Prices ($130.96, $82.56, $70.55) at the top of each bar.  \n  - **Category labels**: Vehicle names (\"Ford F150\", \"Toyota RAV4\", \"Honda Civic\") below the bars; \"Ford F150\" includes a sub-label \"(Regular Cab)\".  \n  - **Title**: \"Total fueling cost\" at the bottom, below a horizontal line.  \n- **Horizontal line**: Separates the category labels from the title.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **solid, flat colors** (no gradients, patterns, or transparency) for a clean, modern look:  \n- **Bars**: Medium purple (#9370DB; RGB: 147, 112, 219).  \n- **Text**: Black (#000000; RGB: 0, 0, 0) for high contrast and readability.  \n- **Horizontal line**: Black (same as text).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe graph adheres to **standard vertical bar graph conventions**, with all bars rising from a **common baseline** (bottom edge alignment). Below is a breakdown using **SVG coordinates** (top-left = `(0,0)`):  \n\n#### **Baseline (Critical for Bar Alignment)**  \nAll bars have their **bottom edges aligned** at a horizontal baseline (`y = 180px`). This is the \"x-axis\" of the graph, ensuring consistent vertical positioning.  \n\n#### **Bars**  \nThree rectangular bars with identical widths (`60px`) and spacing (`40px` between bars). Heights vary proportionally to their values (Ford = tallest, Honda = shortest):  \n- **Ford F150**:  \n  - Position: `x = 20px` (left margin), `y = 30px` (top of bar, calculated as `baseline y - height`).  \n  - Dimensions: `width = 60px`, `height = 150px` (rises from `y = 180px` to `y = 30px`).  \n- **Toyota RAV4**:  \n  - Position: `x = 120px` (left margin + Ford bar width + spacing), `y = 85.5px`.  \n  - Dimensions: `width = 60px`, `height = 94.5px` (calculated as `(82.56/130.96) × 150px`).  \n- **Honda Civic**:  \n  - Position: `x = 220px` (left margin + 2× bar width + 2× spacing), `y = 99px`.  \n  - Dimensions: `width = 60px`, `height = 81px` (calculated as `(70.55/130.96) × 150px`).  \n\n#### **Text Elements**  \nAll text is **sans-serif** (e.g., Arial) and horizontally centered for alignment. Font sizes and weights are optimized for readability:  \n- **Data Values (Prices)**:  \n  - Position: Centered over each bar, `5px` above the bar’s top edge.  \n  - Style: Bold, `14px`, black.  \n  - Examples:  \n    - Ford: `x = 50px` (20px + 60px/2), `y = 25px` (30px - 5px), text: `\"$130.96\"`.  \n    - Toyota: `x = 150px`, `y = 80.5px`, text: `\"$82.56\"`.  \n    - Honda: `x = 250px`, `y = 94px`, text: `\"$70.55\"`.  \n- **Category Labels (Vehicle Names)**:  \n  - Position: Centered over each bar, `10px` below the baseline (`y = 190px`).  \n  - Style: Regular, `12px`, black.  \n  - Examples:  \n    - Ford: `x = 50px`, `y = 190px`, text: `\"Ford F150\"`.  \n    - Toyota: `x = 150px`, `y = 190px`, text: `\"Toyota RAV4\"`.  \n    - Honda: `x = 250px`, `y = 190px`, text: `\"Honda Civic\"`.  \n- **Ford Sub-Label (\"(Regular Cab)\")**:  \n  - Position: Centered over the Ford bar, `2px` below the main label (`y = 204px`).  \n  - Style: Regular, `10px`, black.  \n  - Example: `x = 50px`, `y = 204px`, text: `\"(Regular Cab)\"`.  \n- **Title (\"Total fueling cost\")**:  \n  - Position: Centered horizontally, `5px` below the horizontal line (`y = 221px`).  \n  - Style: Bold, `13px`, black.  \n  - Example: `x = 150px` (300px/2), `y = 221px`, text: `\"Total fueling cost\"`.  \n\n#### **Horizontal Line**  \n- Position: Spans from the left edge of the Ford bar to the right edge of the Honda bar (`x = 20px` to `x = 280px`), `10px` below the lowest category label (`y = 214px`).  \n- Style: Solid black, `2px` thick.  \n- Example: `<line x1=\"20\" y1=\"214\" x2=\"280\" y2=\"214\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>`.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalist Design**: Uses solid colors, clean lines, and simple shapes for a modern, uncluttered look.  \n- **Visual Hierarchy**:  \n  - **Most Prominent**: Data values (bold, largest font) to emphasize fueling costs.  \n  - **Next**: Title (bold, medium font) to clarify the graph’s purpose.  \n  - **Least Prominent**: Category labels (regular font) to provide context without distracting from key data.  \n- **Symmetry**: Equal spacing between bars and consistent margins (20px left/right) create balance.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Currency Symbols**: Dollar signs ($) in data values indicate currency.  \n- **Ford Sub-Label**: \"(Regular Cab)\" is included to specify the truck model, using a smaller font to avoid cluttering the graph.  \n- **Alignment**: All elements (bars, text, line) are horizontally centered or aligned to reinforce structure.  \n\n\n### **Key SVG Code Snippets**\nBelow are the critical SVG elements to recreate the graph, using the dimensions and positions outlined above:  \n\n```svg\n<svg width=\"300\" height=\"250\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Bars -->\n  <rect x=\"20\" y=\"30\" width=\"60\" height=\"150\" fill=\"#9370DB\"/>\n  <rect x=\"120\" y=\"85.5\" width=\"60\" height=\"94.5\" fill=\"#9370DB\"/>\n  <rect x=\"220\" y=\"99\" width=\"60\" height=\"81\" fill=\"#9370DB\"/>\n\n  <!-- Data Values (Prices) -->\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"25\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">$130.96</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"80.5\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">$82.56</text>\n  <text x=\"250\" y=\"94\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">$70.55</text>\n\n  <!-- Category Labels (Vehicle Names) -->\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"190\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Ford F150</text>\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"190\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Toyota RAV4</text>\n  <text x=\"250\" y=\"190\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Honda Civic</text>\n\n  <!-- Ford Sub-Label -->\n  <text x=\"50\" y=\"204\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"10\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">(Regular Cab)</text>\n\n  <!-- Horizontal Line -->\n  <line x1=\"20\" y1=\"214\" x2=\"280\" y2=\"214\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n\n  <!-- Title -->\n  <text x=\"150\" y=\"221\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"13\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Total fueling cost</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Proportions and Layout Rules**\n- **Bar Heights**: Calculated as `(value / maximum value) × maximum bar height`.

  "v1_43": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we need a detailed breakdown of its structure, elements, and design. Below is a comprehensive description organized by the user’s requested focus areas, including critical geometric and layout details.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **vertical bar graph** comparing the total fueling costs of three vehicles. Key elements include:  \n- **Three vertical rectangular bars**: Representing fueling costs for the Ford F150 (Regular Cab), Toyota RAV4, and Honda Civic.  \n- **Text elements**:  \n  - **Data values**: Prices ($130.96, $82.56, $70.55) at the top of each bar.  \n  - **Category labels**: Vehicle names (\"Ford F150\", \"Toyota RAV4\", \"Honda Civic\") below the bars; \"Ford F150\" includes a sub-label \"(Regular Cab)\".  \n  - **Title**: \"Total fueling cost\" at the bottom, below a horizontal line.  \n- **Horizontal line**: Separates the category labels from the title.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **solid, flat colors** (no gradients, patterns, or transparency) for a clean, modern look:  \n- **Bars**: Medium purple (#9370DB; RGB: 147, 112, 219).  \n- **Text**: Black (#000000; RGB: 0, 0, 0) for high contrast and readability.  \n- **Horizontal line**: Black (same as text).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe graph adheres to **standard vertical bar graph conventions**, with all bars rising from a **common baseline** (bottom edge alignment). Below is a breakdown using **SVG coordinates** (top-left = `(0,0)`):  \n\n#### **Baseline (Critical for Bar Alignment)**  \nAll bars have their **bottom edges aligned** at a horizontal baseline (`y = 180px`). This is the \"x-axis\" of the graph, ensuring consistent vertical positioning.  \n\n#### **Bars**  \nThree rectangular bars with identical widths (`60px`) and spacing (`40px` between bars). Heights vary proportionally to their values (Ford = tallest, Honda = shortest):  \n- **Ford F150**:  \n  - Position: `x = 20px` (left margin), `y = 30px` (top of bar, calculated as `baseline y - height`).  \n  - Dimensions: `width = 60px`, `height = 150px` (rises from `y = 180px` to `y = 30px`).  \n- **Toyota RAV4**:  \n  - Position: `x = 120px` (left margin + Ford bar width + spacing), `y = 85.5px`.  \n  - Dimensions: `width = 60px`, `height = 94.5px` (calculated as `(82.56/130.96) × 150px`).  \n- **Honda Civic**:  \n  - Position: `x = 220px` (left margin + 2× bar width + 2× spacing), `y = 99px`.  \n  - Dimensions: `width = 60px`, `height = 81px` (calculated as `(70.55/130.96) × 150px`).  \n\n#### **Text Elements**  \nAll text is **sans-serif** (e.g., Arial) and horizontally centered for alignment.

  "v1_44": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this infographic, the following detailed description covers **all critical elements**—including layout, color, typography, and geometric proportions—organized by the user’s specified focus areas.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe infographic is a **vertical, structured design** with three primary sections:  \n- **Top Header**: Headline and subhead.  \n- **Middle Charts**: Two side-by-side horizontal bar charts (left: *Plastic made*; right: *Plastic thrown out*).  \n- **Bottom Narrative**: A paragraph with a plastic bottle icon, explaining key data.  \n\n### Key Objects\n| Section       | Elements                                                                 |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Header**    | Bold headline, smaller subhead.                                         |\n| **Left Chart** | 9 pink bars (8 categories + *Total*), y-axis category labels, x-axis values. |\n| **Right Chart**| 9 purple bars (8 categories + *Total*), y-axis category labels, x-axis values. |\n| **Bottom**    | Simple plastic bottle icon (line art), paragraph with highlighted text. |\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nThe design uses a **flat, modern aesthetic** with solid colors (no gradients or shadows) and sans-serif fonts for readability. Below are exact color codes (hex) and visual properties:\n\n### Typography\n| Element               | Color       | Font Style       | Size (Relative) | Alignment |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Headline              | `#000000`   | Bold sans-serif  | 28px            | Left      |\n| Subhead               | `#666666`   | Regular sans-serif | 16px          | Left      |\n| Chart Titles (Left)   | `#E85D75`   | Regular sans-serif | 18px          | Centered  |\n| Chart Titles (Right)  | `#8A64C8`   | Regular sans-serif | 18px          | Centered  |\n| Category Labels       | `#666666`   | Regular sans-serif | 12px          | Right     |\n| Bar Values            | `#666666`   | Regular sans-serif | 12px          | Left      |\n| Paragraph Text        | `#333333`   | Regular sans-serif | 14px          | Left      |\n| Bold Paragraph Text   | `#333333`   | Bold sans-serif   | 14px          | Left      |\n| Highlighted Text (Pink) | `#E85D75` | Regular sans-serif | 14px          | Left      |\n| Highlighted Text (Purple) | `#8A64C8` | Regular sans-serif | 14px      | Left      |\n\n### Colors\n| Element               | Color Code  | Description                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| Left Chart Bars       | `#E85D75`   | Medium pink (matches left chart title) |\n| Right Chart Bars      | `#8A64C8`   | Medium purple (matches right chart title) |\n| Plastic Bottle Icon   | `#888888`   | Light gray (line art)        |\n| Grid Lines (Subtle)   | `#EEEEEE`   | 1px horizontal lines between chart categories |\n\n### Shapes\n- **Bars**: Rectangles (solid color, no borders) extending right from the y-axis.  \n- **Plastic Bottle Icon**: Simple line art (cap + body with 3 horizontal lines, 24x24px relative to paragraph text).  \n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe layout follows a **top-to-bottom hierarchical flow** (headline → charts → narrative) with equal margins and balanced spacing. Below is a breakdown of **relative proportions** (assuming a 100% total height/width for the SVG):\n\n### Section Layout\n| Section       | Height (Relative) | Width (Relative) | Positioning                          |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Header**    | 15% (10% headline + 5% subhead) | 100%             | Top of the image, left-aligned.      |\n| **Charts**    | 60%               | 90%              | Below header, centered (5% margins left/right). |\n| **Narrative** | 25%               | 100%             | Bottom of the image, left-aligned.   |\n\n### Chart Layout (Left/Right)\nThe two charts are **side-by-side** (45% width each) with a 5% gap between them. Each chart has:  \n- **Y-Axis (Categories)**: 30% of the chart width (right-aligned labels).  \n- **Bars**: 70% of the chart width (extend right from the y-axis).  \n\n#### Category Order (Y-Axis, Top-to-Bottom)\n*Same for both charts*:  \n`Industrial Machines` → `Electronics` → `Transportation` → `Consumer Products` → `Other` → `Textiles` → `Construction` → `Packaging` → `Total`  \n\n#### Bar Positioning\nEach category has a **bar to the right of its label** (left chart: pink; right chart: purple). The `Total` bar is the **longest** in each chart (spans 100% of the bar area).\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe design uses a **clean, data-driven style** with:  \n- **Flat Design**: No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects (solid colors only).  \n- **Color Coding**: Pink (`#E85D75`) for \"plastic made\" and purple (`#8A64C8`) for \"plastic thrown out\" to distinguish datasets.  \n- **Hierarchical Typography**: Large, bold headlines draw attention; smaller, lighter text (subhead, categories) guides focus to data.  \n- **Minimal Icons**: A simple plastic bottle (line art) reinforces the \"waste\" theme without cluttering the narrative.  \n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Header Text\n- **Headline**: `Plastic Waste is Out of Control` (bold, black, left-aligned).  \n- **Subhead**: `In 2015, humans threw out almost as much plastic as they made.` (gray, smaller, left-aligned).  \n\n### Chart Text\n| Chart               | Title                          | Category Labels (Y-Axis)       | Bar Values (X-Axis)             |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Left (Made)**     | `Plastic made (metric tonnes)` | `Industrial Machines`, `Electronics`, etc. | `3M`, `18M`, `27M`, ..., `407M` |\n| **Right (Thrown Out)** | `Plastic thrown out (metric tonnes)` | Same as left chart | `1M`, `13M`, `17M`, ..., `302M` |\n\n### Narrative Text (Bottom)\nA paragraph with **highlighted data** and a plastic bottle icon (left of text):  \n> `In 2015, humans produced 407 million metric tons of new plastic, continuing the trend of making more and more plastic each year. Meanwhile, 302 million metric tons was discarded as waste, meaning it wasn't recycled or incinerated; it's just sitting in a dump or the ocean somewhere.`  \n\n- **Bold Text**: `407`, `302` (emphasizes key totals).  \n- **Colored Text**:  \n  - `new plastic` (pink: `#E85D75`, matches left chart).  \n  - `discarded as waste` (purple: `#8A64C8`, matches right chart).  \n\n### Symbols\n- **Plastic Bottle Icon**: Simple line art (24x24px) with:  \n  - A rectangular cap (top).  \n  - A rectangular body with 3 horizontal lines (indicating a bottle shape).  \n  - Light gray (`#888888`), positioned **left of the paragraph** (vertically aligned with the top of the text).  \n\n\n## 6. Geometric Details and Proportions (Critical for SVG)\nThe **most important detail for accuracy** is the **relative length of the bars**, which must be scaled to their respective `Total` values (left chart: 407M; right chart: 302M). Below are the **proportions** (bar length as a percentage of the `Total` bar length):\n\n### Left Chart (Plastic Made, Total = 407M)\n| Category           | Value | Bar Length (% of Total) |\n|--------------------|-------|-------------------------|\n| Industrial Machines | 3M    | 0.74% (3/407)           |\n| Electronics         | 18M   | 4.42% (18/407)          |\n| Transportation      | 27M   | 6.63% (27/407)          |\n| Consumer Products   | 42M   | 10.32% (42/407)         |\n| Other               | 47M   | 11.55% (47/407)         |\n| Textiles            | 59M   | 14.50% (59/407)         |\n| Construction        | 65M   | 15.97% (65/407)         |\n| Packaging           | 146M  | 35.87% (146/407)        |\n| **Total**           | 407M  | 100% (full bar length)  |\n\n### Right Chart (Plastic Thrown Out, Total = 302M)\n| Category           | Value | Bar Length (% of Total) |\n|--------------------|-------|-------------------------|\n| Industrial Machines | 1M    | 0.33% (1/302)           |\n| Electronics         | 13M   | 4.31% (13/302)          |\n| Transportation      | 17M   | 5.63% (17/302)          |\n| Consumer Products   | 37M   | 12.25% (37/302)         |\n| Other               | 38M   | 12.58% (38/302)         |\n| Textiles            | 42M   | 13.91% (42/302)         |\n| Construction        | 13M   | 4.31% (13/302)          |\n| Packaging           | 141M  | 46.69% (141/302)        |\n| **Total**           | 302M  | 100% (full bar length)  |\n\n### Example: SVG Implementation for Bars\nFor the left chart’s `Packaging` bar (146M, 35.87% of Total):  \n- If the `Total` bar is 200px long (relative to the chart’s bar area), the `Packaging` bar would be `200px * 0.3587 = 71.74px` long.  \n\nThis scaling ensures the bars accurately reflect the data hierarchy (e.g., `Packaging` is the largest category in both charts).\n\n\n## 7. Final Layout Checklist (SVG)\nTo ensure fidelity to the original, the SVG must adhere to these **non-negotiable layout rules**:  \n1. **Bar Proportions**: All bars are scaled to their respective `Total` values (left: 407M; right: 302M).  \n2. **Category Order**: Y-axis categories are listed **top-to-bottom** as:  \n   `Industrial Machines` → `Electronics` → `Transportation` → `Consumer Products` → `Other` → `Textiles` → `Construction` → `Packaging` → `Total`.  \n3. **Color Consistency**: Pink (`#E85D75`) for \"made\" data (chart title, bars, `new plastic` text); purple (`#8A64C8`) for \"thrown out\" data (chart title, bars, `discarded as waste` text).  \n4. **Spacing**: Equal margins (5% of total width) on the left/right of the image; 5% gap between the two charts.  \n5. **Typography**: Sans-serif fonts for all text (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, or a web-safe sans-serif).  \n\nBy following this description, the SVG will be a **pixel-accurate reproduction** of the original infographic, with all data and visual elements intact.\n\n\n## Summary of Critical SVG Values\n| Element               | Value                                  |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Left Chart Bar Color  | `#E85D75`                              |\n| Right Chart Bar Color | `#8A64C8`                              |\n| Headline Font         | Bold sans-serif, 28px, `#000000`       |\n| Chart Title Font      | 18px, `#E85D75` (left), `#8A64C8` (right) |\n| Bar Length Proportion (Left) | Scaled to 407M (Total) |\n| Bar Length Proportion (Right) | Scaled to 302M (Total) |\n| Plastic Bottle Icon   | 24x24px, `#888888`, line art           |\n\nThis detailed breakdown provides everything needed to create an accurate, visually consistent SVG—from color codes to geometric scaling.",
  "v1_45": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this infographic, the following detailed description covers **all critical elements**—including layout, color, typography, and geometric proportions—organized by the user’s specified focus areas.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe infographic is a **vertical, structured design** with three primary sections:  \n- **Top Header**: Headline and subhead.  \n- **Middle Charts**: Two side-by-side horizontal bar charts (left: *Plastic made*; right: *Plastic thrown out*).  \n- **Bottom Narrative**: A paragraph with a plastic bottle icon, explaining key data.  \n\n### Key Objects\n| Section       | Elements                                                                 |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Header**    | Bold headline, smaller subhead.                                         |\n| **Left Chart** | 9 pink bars (8 categories + *Total*), y-axis category labels, x-axis values. |\n| **Right Chart**| 9 purple bars (8 categories + *Total*), y-axis category labels, x-axis values. |\n| **Bottom**    | Simple plastic bottle icon (line art), paragraph with highlighted text. |\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nThe design uses a **flat, modern aesthetic** with solid colors (no gradients or shadows) and sans-serif fonts for readability. Below are exact color codes (hex) and visual properties:\n\n### Typography\n| Element               | Color       | Font Style       | Size (Relative) | Alignment |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Headline              | `#000000`   | Bold sans-serif  | 28px            | Left      |\n| Subhead               | `#666666`   | Regular sans-serif | 16px          | Left      |\n| Chart Titles (Left)   | `#E85D75`   | Regular sans-serif | 18px          | Centered  |\n| Chart Titles (Right)  | `#8A64C8`   | Regular sans-serif | 18px          | Centered  |\n| Category Labels       | `#666666`   | Regular sans-serif | 12px          | Right     |\n| Bar Values            | `#666666`   | Regular sans-serif | 12px          | Left      |\n| Paragraph Text        | `#333333`   | Regular sans-serif | 14px          | Left      |\n| Bold Paragraph Text   | `#333333`   | Bold sans-serif   | 14px          | Left      |\n| Highlighted Text (Pink) | `#E85D75` | Regular sans-serif | 14px          | Left      |\n| Highlighted Text (Purple) | `#8A64C8` | Regular sans-serif | 14px      | Left      |\n\n### Colors\n| Element               | Color Code  | Description                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------------|\n| Left Chart Bars       | `#E85D75`   | Medium pink (matches left chart title) |\n| Right Chart Bars      | `#8A64C8`   | Medium purple (matches right chart title) |\n| Plastic Bottle Icon   | `#888888`   | Light gray (line art)        |\n| Grid Lines (Subtle)   | `#EEEEEE`   | 1px horizontal lines between chart categories |\n\n### Shapes\n- **Bars**: Rectangles (solid color, no borders) extending right from the y-axis.  \n- **Plastic Bottle Icon**: Simple line art (cap + body with 3 horizontal lines, 24x24px relative to paragraph text).  \n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe layout follows a **top-to-bottom hierarchical flow** (headline → charts → narrative) with equal margins and balanced spacing. Below is a breakdown of **relative proportions** (assuming a 100% total height/width for the SVG):\n\n### Section Layout\n| Section       | Height (Relative) | Width (Relative) | Positioning                          |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Header**    | 15% (10% headline + 5% subhead) | 100%             | Top of the image, left-aligned.      |\n| **Charts**    | 60%               | 90%              | Below header, centered (5% margins left/right). |\n| **Narrative** | 25%               | 100%             | Bottom of the image, left-aligned.   |\n\n### Chart Layout (Left/Right)\nThe two charts are **side-by-side** (45% width each) with a 5% gap between them. Each chart has:  \n- **Y-Axis (Categories)**: 30% of the chart width (right-aligned labels).  \n- **Bars**: 70% of the chart width (extend right from the y-axis).  \n\n#### Category Order (Y-Axis, Top-to-Bottom)\n*Same for both charts*:  \n`Industrial Machines` → `Electronics` → `Transportation` → `Consumer Products` → `Other` → `Textiles` → `Construction` → `Packaging` → `Total`  \n\n#### Bar Positioning\nEach category has a **bar to the right of its label** (left chart: pink; right chart: purple). The `Total` bar is the **longest** in each chart (spans 100% of the bar area).\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe design uses a **clean, data-driven style** with:  \n- **Flat Design**: No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects (solid colors only).  \n- **Color Coding**: Pink (`#E85D75`) for \"plastic made\" and purple (`#8A64C8`) for \"plastic thrown out\" to distinguish datasets.  \n- **Hierarchical Typography**: Large, bold headlines draw attention; smaller, lighter text (subhead, categories) guides focus to data.  \n- **Minimal Icons**: A simple plastic bottle (line art) reinforces the \"waste\" theme without cluttering the narrative.  \n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Header Text\n- **Headline**: `Plastic Waste is Out of Control` (bold, black, left-aligned).  \n- **Subhead**: `In 2015, humans threw out almost as much plastic as they made.` (gray, smaller, left-aligned).  \n\n### Chart Text\n| Chart               | Title                          | Category Labels (Y-Axis)       | Bar Values (X-Axis)             |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Left (Made)**     | `Plastic made (metric tonnes)` | `Industrial Machines`, `Electronics`, etc. | `3M`, `18M`, `27M`, ..., `407M` |\n| **Right (Thrown Out)** | `Plastic thrown out (metric tonnes)` | Same as left chart | `1M`, `13M`, `17M`, ..., `302M` |\n\n### Narrative Text (Bottom)\nA paragraph with **highlighted data** and a plastic bottle icon (left of text):  \n> `In 2015, humans produced 407 million metric tons of new plastic, continuing the trend of making more and more plastic each year. Meanwhile, 302 million metric tons was discarded as waste, meaning it wasn't recycled or incinerated; it's just sitting in a dump or the ocean somewhere.`  \n\n- **Bold Text**: `407`, `302` (emphasizes key totals).  \n- **Colored Text**:  \n  - `new plastic` (pink: `#E85D75`, matches left chart).  \n  - `discarded as waste` (purple: `#8A64C8`, matches right chart).  \n\n### Symbols\n- **Plastic Bottle Icon**: Simple line art (24x24px) with:  \n  - A rectangular cap (top).  \n  - A rectangular body with 3 horizontal lines (indicating a bottle shape).  \n  - Light gray (`#888888`), positioned **left of the paragraph** (vertically aligned with the top of the text).  \n\n\n## 6. Geometric Details and Proportions (Critical for SVG)\nThe **most important detail for accuracy** is the **relative length of the bars**, which must be scaled to their respective `Total` values (left chart: 407M; right chart: 302M).

Colors & Textures\n| Element | Color (Hex) | Notes |\n|---------|-------------|-------|\n| Background | `#FFFFFF` | Solid white. |\n| Title/Subtitle | `#000000` | Bold (title) / regular (subtitle) sans-serif. |\n| Legend Labels | `#000000` | Regular sans-serif. |\n| **Gas Price Layers** | `#E6F9E6` (light mint, 2020–2022) / `#F0E6FA` (light lavender, Q4 2022) / `#FFF2E6` (light peach, 2023) | Top layer of each bar. |\n| **Electricity Price Layers** | `#B3E0B3` (medium sage, 2020–2022) / `#D9B3FF` (medium purple, Q4 2022) / `#FFD9B3` (medium peach, 2023) | Middle layer of each bar. |\n| **Standing Charges Layers** | `#669966` (dark forest, 2020–2022) / `#9966CC` (dark purple, Q4 2022) / `#FF9933` (dark orange, 2023) | Bottom layer of each bar. |\n| **Layer Text (Dark Layers)** | `#FFFFFF` | White text on dark standing charges layers (contrast). |\n| **Layer Text (Light/Medium Layers)** | `#000000` | Black text on gas/electricity layers. |\n| Forecast Box Border | `#E0E0E0` | 1px solid light gray. |\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships & Layout\nThe image uses a **left-right split** for historical vs. forecast data, with the forecast section emphasized by a border. Key proportions:\n\n### Overall Canvas\n- **Width**: ~1200px (standard chart width).  \n- **Height**: ~800px (tall enough to accommodate tall forecast bars).  \n\n### Title & Legend\n- **Title**: Left-aligned, top of the canvas (e.g., `x=20px`, `y=30px`), font size: 24pt (bold).  \n- **Subtitle**: Below the title (e.g., `x=20px`, `y=60px`), font size: 16pt (regular).  \n- **Legend**: Left-aligned, below the subtitle (e.g., `x=20px`, `y=100px`). Each row (3 total) includes 3 swatches (12x12px) and a label (font size: 16pt).  \n\n### Historical Data Section (Left)\n- **Position**: Below the legend (e.g., `x=20px`, `y=200px`).  \n- **Bars**: 5 bars, each **40px wide** with **20px spacing** (total width: `5*40 + 4*20 = 280px`).  \n- **Bar Height**: Proportional to total value (linear scale). For example:  \n  - Shortest bar: £1,042 (Q4-Q1 2020-2021) → ~50px tall.  \n  - Tallest historical bar: £3,549 (Q4 2022) → ~175px tall.  \n- **Total Value Labels**: Top-left of each bar (e.g., `x=30px`, `y=210px` for £1,042), font size: 16pt.  \n- **Period Labels**: Below each bar, centered (e.g., `x=40px`, `y=550px` for Q4-Q1 2020-2021), font size: 12pt.  \n\n### Forecast Section (Right)\n- **Box**: Right of the historical section (e.g., `x=350px`, `y=100px`), **700px wide × 550px tall**, with a 1px light gray border.  \n- **Title**: Left-aligned inside the box (e.g., `x=370px`, `y=120px`), font size: 16pt (bold).  \n- **Bars**: 4 bars, each **120px wide** with **30px spacing** (total width: `4*120 + 3*30 = 570px`).  \n- **Bar Height**: Proportional to total value. For example:  \n  - Tallest bar: £6,620 (Q2 2023) → ~400px tall.  \n  - Shortest forecast bar: £5,390 (Q1 2023) → ~325px tall.  \n- **Total Value Labels**: Top of each bar (e.g., `x=380px`, `y=150px` for £5,390), font size: 16pt.  \n- **Period Labels**: Below each bar, centered inside the box (e.g., `x=440px`, `y=620px` for Q1 2023), font size: 12pt.  \n\n\n## 4. Style & Artistic Characteristics\n- **Chart Type**: Stacked bar chart (shows composition of total energy price cap by component).  \n- **Color Coding**:  \n  - **Green Palette (2020–2022)**: Early historical data.  \n  - **Purple Palette (Q4 2022)**: Late historical data (transition to forecasts).  \n  - **Peach Palette (2023)**: Forecasts (highlighted with a border).  \n- **Readability**:  \n  - White text on dark standing charges layers (contrast).  \n  - Black text on light/medium gas/electricity layers.  \n  - Total value labels positioned to avoid overlap (top-left for short bars, top for tall bars).  \n- **Professionalism**: Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial/Helvetica), minimal clutter, and a border around forecasts to distinguish them from historical data.  \n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols & Specific Details\nAll text uses a **sans-serif font** (e.g., Arial) for readability. Key text elements:\n\n### Title & Subtitle\n- **Main Title**: \"Energy price cap update\" (bold, 24pt, `x=20px`, `y=30px`).  \n- **Subtitle**: \"ICAEW chart of the week\" (regular, 16pt, `x=20px`, `y=60px`).  \n\n### Legend\n- **Row 1**: Swatches (`#E6F9E6`, `#F0E6FA`, `#FFF2E6`) + \"Gas price/kWh\" (16pt, `x=60px`, `y=100px`).  \n- **Row 2**: Swatches (`#B3E0B3`, `#D9B3FF`, `#FFD9B3`) + \"Electricity price/kWh\" (16pt, `x=60px`, `y=130px`).  \n- **Row 3**: Swatches (`#669966`, `#9966CC`, `#FF9933`) + \"Standing charges\" (16pt, `x=60px`, `y=160px`).  \n\n### Historical Bars (Left)\n| Period | Total Value | Standing Charges (£) | Electricity (p/kWh) | Gas (p/kWh) |\n|--------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Q4-Q1 2020-2021 | £1,042 | £184 (dark green, white text) | 17.2p (medium green, black text) | 3.0p (light green, black text) |\n| Q2-Q3 2021 | £1,138 | £188 (dark green, white text) | 19.0p (medium green, black text) | 3.3p (light green, black text) |\n| Q4-Q1 2021-2022 | £1,277 | £186 (dark green, white text) | 20.8p (medium green, black text) | 4.1p (light green, black text) |\n| Q2-Q3 2022 | £1,971 | £265 (dark green, white text) | 28.3p (medium green, black text) | 7.4p (light green, black text) |\n| Q4 2022 | £3,549 | £273 (dark purple, white text) | 51.9p (medium purple, black text) | 14.8p (light purple, black text) |\n\n### Forecast Bars (Right, Inside Bordered Box)\n| Period | Total Value | Standing Charges (£) | Electricity (p/kWh) | Gas (p/kWh) |\n|--------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Q1 2023 | £5,390 | £275 (dark orange, white text) | 80.5p (medium peach, black text) | 23.2p (light peach, black text) |\n| Q2 2023 | £6,620 | £280 (dark orange, white text) | 91.8p (medium peach, black text) | 30.8p (light peach, black text) |\n| Q3 2023 | £5,900 | £280 (dark orange, white text) | 78.3p (medium peach, black text) | 27.9p (light peach, black text) |\n| Q4 2023 | £5,890 | £250 (dark orange, white text) | 79.8p (medium peach, black text) | 27.8p (light peach, black text) |\n\n### Layer Text Positioning\n- **Dark Layers (Standing Charges)**: Text centered horizontally, 5px from the top of the layer (e.g., £184 in the first historical bar: `x=40px`, `y=450px`).  \n- **Light/Medium Layers (Gas/Electricity)**: Text centered horizontally, 5px from the top of the layer (e.g., 17.2p in the first historical bar: `x=40px`, `y=400px`).  \n\n\n## 6. SVG Implementation Notes\nTo recreate this chart accurately:  \n1. **Use Groups**: Group each bar’s layers (e.g., `<g id=\"historical-bar-1\">` for Q4-Q1 2020-2021).  \n2. **Linear Scaling**: Calculate bar heights using a linear scale (e.g., 1px = £20 → £1,042 = 52px tall, £6,620 = 331px tall).  \n3. **Border for Forecasts**: Draw a rectangle with a 1px `#E0E0E0` border around the forecast section.  \n4. **Text Alignment**: Use `text-anchor=\"middle\"` for centered labels (periods, layer values) and `text-anchor=\"start\"` for left-aligned labels (title, total values).  \n\nExample SVG snippet for a historical bar:\n```svg\n<g id=\"historical-bar-1\">\n  <!-- Standing Charges (Bottom Layer) -->\n  <rect x=\"20px\" y=\"450px\" width=\"40px\" height=\"50px\" fill=\"#669966\"/>\n  <text x=\"40px\" y=\"475px\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" font-size=\"12pt\">£184</text>\n  <!-- Electricity (Middle Layer) -->\n  <rect x=\"20px\" y=\"400px\" width=\"40px\" height=\"50px\" fill=\"#B3E0B3\"/>\n  <text x=\"40px\" y=\"425px\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#000000\" font-size=\"12pt\">17.2p</text>\n  <!-- Gas (Top Layer) -->\n  <rect x=\"20px\" y=\"370px\" width=\"40px\" height=\"30px\" fill=\"#E6F9E6\"/>\n  <text x=\"40px\" y=\"385px\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#000000\" font-size=\"12pt\">3.0p</text>\n  <!-- Total Value -->\n  <text x=\"30px\" y=\"350px\" fill=\"#000000\" font-size=\"16pt\">£1,042</text>\n  <!-- Period Label -->\n  <text x=\"40px\" y=\"550px\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"#000000\" font-size=\"12pt\">Q4-Q1 2020-2021</text>\n</g>\n```\n\n\nThis detailed breakdown covers all elements needed to recreate the chart as an SVG, including geometric proportions, color codes, text positioning, and style.

Key dimensions:  \n\n| Element               | Dimensions       | Notes                                      |\n|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **Terrace**           | 258in × 96in     | 21’6” × 8’0” (exterior: double 6px walls).  |\n| **Dining Area**       | 118in × 156in    | 9’10” × 13’0”.                             |\n| **Kitchen**           | 89in × 147in     | 7’5” × 12’3” (contains oven/DW).           |\n| **Second Bedroom**    | 130in × 175in    | 10’10” × 14’7”.                            |\n| **Master Bedroom**    | 154in × 213in    | 12’10” × 17’9” (attached to closet).       |\n| **WC**                | 62in × 62in      | 5’2” × 5’2” (square).                      |\n| **Foyer**             | 72in × 106in     | 6’0” × 8’10” (6’34” corrected to standard).|\n| **Living Room**       | 174in × 245in    | 14’6” × 20’5” (largest room).              |\n| **Master Closet**     | 59in × 82in      | 4’11” × 6’10” (attached to Master Bedroom).|\n| **Hall Closet (CL)**  | 27in × 84in      | 2’3” × 7’0” (vertical, in hall).           |\n\n\n## **5. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Architectural Floor Plan**: Standard technical diagram with clean lines, geometric shapes, and industry symbols (e.g., dashed lines for doors, circles for oven burners).  \n- **Wall Thickness**: Exterior walls (Terrace) use a **double 6px stroke**; interior walls use a **single 4px stroke**.  \n- **Door Swings**: Dashed lines form a **triangle** to indicate swing direction (e.g., Dining Area → Kitchen door swings into the Dining Area).  \n- **Text Placement**: Room names are **centered** in each space; dimensions are centered below room names. Fixture labels (e.g., “oven”) are placed directly on/above symbols.  \n\n\n## **6. Text, Symbols, & Specific Details**\nAll text and symbols are critical for SVG accuracy. Below is a breakdown of key elements:  \n\n### **Room Labels**\n- **Bold, Centered Text**: Room names (e.g., “TERRACE”, “LIVING ROOM”) are placed in the center of each space.  \n- **Dimensions**: Regular font, centered below room names (e.g., “21’6” × 8’0”” below “TERRACE”).  \n\n### **Fixtures & Symbols**\n| Fixture       | Symbol/Description                                  | Position/Notes                                  |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Oven**      | Rectangle with 3 black circles (burners) on top.    | Left side of Kitchen; labeled “oven”.           |\n| **Dishwasher (DW)** | Rectangle labeled “DW”.                         | Right of oven in Kitchen.                       |\n| **Closet (CL)** | Rectangle labeled “CL” with dimensions (e.g., “84” × 27”). | Hall (vertical, 84in tall); includes up/down arrow. |\n| **Toilet**    | Small rectangle (tank) with a circle (seat) below.  | Center of WC; labeled “WC”.                     |\n| **Tub**       | Large oval (1:2 aspect ratio).                     | Left side of Bath; labeled “BATH”.              |\n| **Sink**      | Small rectangle.                                    | Center of Bath (above tub).                     |\n| **Linen Closet (LC)** | Small rectangle labeled “LC”.                  | Above sink in Bath.                             |\n| **Entrance**  | Two parallel lines with an arrowhead (pointing in). | Bottom-right; labeled “Entrance”.               |\n\n### **Doors**\n- **Dashed Lines**: Stroke-dasharray: `4, 2` (4px dash, 2px gap).  \n- **Swing Direction**: Dashed lines form a **triangle** to indicate which room the door swings into (e.g., Dining Area → Kitchen door swings into the Dining Area).  \n\n### **Arrows**\n- **Closet Direction**: Up/down arrow (two vertical lines with arrowheads) on the hall closet to indicate it runs vertically.  \n- **Entrance**: Arrowhead pointing into the Foyer (indicates entry direction).  \n\n\n## **7. SVG Implementation Guidelines**\nTo recreate the image accurately, use the following SVG elements and properties:  \n\n### **Walls**\n- **Exterior (Terrace)**: Double `<rect>` elements (6px stroke, 6px gap between them).  \n  Example: `<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"258\" height=\"96\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"6\" fill=\"white\" />`  \n  `<rect x=\"6\" y=\"6\" width=\"246\" height=\"84\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"6\" fill=\"white\" />`  \n- **Interior**: Single `<rect>` elements (4px stroke).  \n  Example: `<rect x=\"0\" y=\"96\" width=\"118\" height=\"156\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"white\" />` (Dining Area).  \n\n### **Doors**\n- **Dashed Lines**: `<line>` or `<path>` elements with `stroke-dasharray=\"4, 2\"`.  \n  Example (Dining Area → Kitchen door):  \n  `<path d=\"M118 174 L130 174 L118 186\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-dasharray=\"4, 2\" fill=\"none\" />`  \n  (Starts at the right wall of the Dining Area, curves to the right, then down to form a triangle.)  \n\n### **Text**\n- **Room Names**: Bold, 16px font (e.g., `<text x=\"129\" y=\"48\" font-size=\"16\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"black\">TERRACE</text>`).  \n- **Dimensions**: Regular, 12px font (e.g., `<text x=\"129\" y=\"68\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\">21’6” × 8’0”</text>`).  \n- **Fixture Labels**: Regular, 12px font (e.g., `<text x=\"143\" y=\"126\" font-size=\"12\" fill=\"black\">oven</text>`).  \n\n### **Fixtures**\n- **Oven Burners**: `<circle>` elements (r=3px, fill=black).  \n  Example: `<circle cx=\"135\" cy=\"113\" r=\"3\" fill=\"black\" />` (3 circles for burners).  \n- **Tub**: `<ellipse>` element (rx=30px, ry=15px).  \n  Example: `<ellipse cx=\"319\" cy=\"355\" rx=\"30\" ry=\"15\" stroke=\"black\" fill=\"white\" />`.  \n\n\n## **8. Coordinate System (1in = 1px)**\nTo maintain proportionality, use the following origin and key coordinates (top-left corner = (0,0)):  \n\n| Element               | X (px) | Y (px) | Width (px) | Height (px) |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|------------|-------------|\n| **Terrace**           | 0      | 0      | 258        | 96          |\n| **Dining Area**       | 0      | 96     | 118        | 156         |\n| **Kitchen**           | 118    | 96     | 89         | 147         |\n| **Hall**              | 207    | 96     | 30         | 147         |\n| **Second Bedroom**    | 237    | 96     | 130        | 175         |\n| **Master Bedroom**    | 367    | 96     | 154        | 213         |\n| **WC**                | 207    | 243    | 62         | 62          |\n| **Foyer**             | 207    | 305    | 72         | 106         |\n| **Living Room**       | 0      | 252    | 174        | 245         |\n| **Bath**              | 279    | 305    | 80         | 106         |\n| **Master Closet**     | 521    | 96     | 59         | 82          |\n\n\n## **9. Final Notes for SVG**\n- **Scaling**: Use `viewBox=\"0 0 600 500\"` (adjust based on total width/height) to ensure the plan fits within the viewport.  \n- **Grouping**: Use `<g>` elements to group related elements (e.g., `<g id=\"kitchen\">` for oven, DW, and Kitchen walls).  \n- **Accessibility**: Add `title` elements to describe rooms/fixtures (e.g., `<title>Terrace (21’6” × 8’0”)</title>`).  \n\nBy following this detailed description, you can recreate the floor plan as an accurate, scalable SVG with all technical and aesthetic details intact.",
  "v1_5": "To accurately recreate the image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of its components, layout, and properties.

For example:\n- **Row 1, Column 1**: Text `5 + a = 7` is placed at `(6px, 21px)` (left padding: 1px + 5px = 6px; vertical midpoint: (1px + 41px)/2 = 21px).\n- **Row 1, Column 2**: Text `40 + y = 45` is placed at `(207px, 21px)` (left padding: 202px + 5px = 207px; vertical midpoint: 21px).\n\nFull text coordinates:\n\n| Row | Column | Text           | X-Coordinate | Y-Coordinate (Baseline) |\n|-----|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n| 1   | 1      | `5 + a = 7`    | 6px          | 21px                    |\n| 1   | 2      | `40 + y = 45`  | 207px        | 21px                    |\n| 2   | 1      | `10 + y = 15`  | 6px          | 62px                    |\n| 2   | 2      | `39 + a = 41`  | 207px        | 62px                    |\n| 3   | 1      | `20 + a = 22`  | 6px          | 103px                   |\n| 3   | 2      | `24 + y = 29`  | 207px        | 103px                   |\n| 4   | 1      | `48 + a = 50`  | 6px          | 144px                   |\n| 4   | 2      | `15 + a =17`   | 207px        | 144px                   |\n| 5   | 1      | `10 + a = 12`  | 6px          | 185px                   |\n| 5   | 2      | `34 + y = 39`  | 207px        | 185px                   |\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Style**: Minimalistic and utilitarian. Designed for **clarity** (mathematical content) with no decorative elements.\n- **Layout**: Grid-based, symmetrical (equal column widths, equal row heights).\n- **Visual Hierarchy**: Flat (all cells are equally emphasized; no focus on specific cells).\n- **Artistic Intent**: To present equations in a structured, easy-to-read format. Functionality takes priority over aesthetics.\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Text**:\n  - **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial), 16px, black.\n  - **Pattern**: Equations follow `[number] + [variable] = [number]` (e.g., `5 + a = 7`).\n  - **Critical Exception**: Cell (4,2) contains `15 + a =17` (**missing space** before `17`—must reproduce this error).\n- **Symbols**: Mathematical operators (`+`, `=`) and variables (`a`, `y`). No other symbols.\n- **Consistency**: All equations (except cell 4,2) have consistent spacing around operators (e.g., `= ` with a space).\n\n\n## SVG Reproduction Guidelines\nTo recreate the table in SVG, use the following elements:\n\n### Borders\nDraw horizontal/vertical lines with:\n- `stroke=\"#000000\"` (black)\n- `stroke-width=\"1\"` (1px)\n\n### Text\nUse `<text>` elements with:\n- `font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\"`\n- `font-size=\"16\"`\n- `fill=\"#000000\"`\n- `x`/`y` coordinates as listed in the **Text Positioning** table.\n\n### Example SVG Code Snippet\n```svg\n<svg width=\"403\" height=\"206\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Horizontal Borders -->\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"41\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"41\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"82\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"82\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"123\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"123\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"164\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"164\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"206\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n  <!-- Vertical Borders -->\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"201\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"201\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"403\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n  <!-- Text (Equations) -->\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"21\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">5 + a = 7</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"21\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">40 + y = 45</text>\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"62\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">10 + y = 15</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"62\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">39 + a = 41</text>\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"103\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">20 + a = 22</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"103\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">24 + y = 29</text>\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"144\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">48 + a = 50</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"144\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">15 + a =17</text> <!-- Missing space -->\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"185\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">10 + a = 12</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"185\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">34 + y = 39</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n## Key Notes for Accuracy\n- **Border Width**: Maintain 1px for all borders (critical for grid alignment).\n- **Cell Dimensions**: Ensure columns (200px) and rows (40px) are equal (excluding borders).\n- **Text Positioning**: Use 5px left padding and vertical centering (baseline at cell midpoints).\n- **Missing Space**: Reproduce `15 + a =17` (cell 4,2) exactly—this is a unique detail in the original image.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately reflect the structure, content, and style of the original image.",

For example:\n- **Row 1, Column 1**: Text `5 + a = 7` is placed at `(6px, 21px)` (left padding: 1px + 5px = 6px; vertical midpoint: (1px + 41px)/2 = 21px).\n- **Row 1, Column 2**: Text `40 + y = 45` is placed at `(207px, 21px)` (left padding: 202px + 5px = 207px; vertical midpoint: 21px).\n\nFull text coordinates:\n\n| Row | Column | Text           | X-Coordinate | Y-Coordinate (Baseline) |\n|-----|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n| 1   | 1      | `5 + a = 7`    | 6px          | 21px                    |\n| 1   | 2      | `40 + y = 45`  | 207px        | 21px                    |\n| 2   | 1      | `10 + y = 15`  | 6px          | 62px                    |\n| 2   | 2      | `39 + a = 41`  | 207px        | 62px                    |\n| 3   | 1      | `20 + a = 22`  | 6px          | 103px                   |\n| 3   | 2      | `24 + y = 29`  | 207px        | 103px                   |\n| 4   | 1      | `48 + a = 50`  | 6px          | 144px                   |\n| 4   | 2      | `15 + a =17`   | 207px        | 144px                   |\n| 5   | 1      | `10 + a = 12`  | 6px          | 185px                   |\n| 5   | 2      | `34 + y = 39`  | 207px        | 185px                   |\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Style**: Minimalistic and utilitarian. Designed for **clarity** (mathematical content) with no decorative elements.\n- **Layout**: Grid-based, symmetrical (equal column widths, equal row heights).\n- **Visual Hierarchy**: Flat (all cells are equally emphasized; no focus on specific cells).\n- **Artistic Intent**: To present equations in a structured, easy-to-read format. Functionality takes priority over aesthetics.\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Text**:\n  - **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial), 16px, black.\n  - **Pattern**: Equations follow `[number] + [variable] = [number]` (e.g., `5 + a = 7`).\n  - **Critical Exception**: Cell (4,2) contains `15 + a =17` (**missing space** before `17`—must reproduce this error).\n- **Symbols**: Mathematical operators (`+`, `=`) and variables (`a`, `y`). No other symbols.\n- **Consistency**: All equations (except cell 4,2) have consistent spacing around operators (e.g., `= ` with a space).\n\n\n## SVG Reproduction Guidelines\nTo recreate the table in SVG, use the following elements:\n\n### Borders\nDraw horizontal/vertical lines with:\n- `stroke=\"#000000\"` (black)\n- `stroke-width=\"1\"` (1px)\n\n### Text\nUse `<text>` elements with:\n- `font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\"`\n- `font-size=\"16\"`\n- `fill=\"#000000\"`\n- `x`/`y` coordinates as listed in the **Text Positioning** table.\n\n### Example SVG Code Snippet\n```svg\n<svg width=\"403\" height=\"206\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Horizontal Borders -->\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"41\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"41\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"82\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"82\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"123\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"123\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"164\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"164\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"206\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n  <!-- Vertical Borders -->\n  <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"201\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"201\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"403\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"403\" y2=\"206\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n  <!-- Text (Equations) -->\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"21\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">5 + a = 7</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"21\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">40 + y = 45</text>\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"62\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">10 + y = 15</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"62\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">39 + a = 41</text>\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"103\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">20 + a = 22</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"103\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">24 + y = 29</text>\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"144\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">48 + a = 50</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"144\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">15 + a =17</text> <!-- Missing space -->\n  <text x=\"6\" y=\"185\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">10 + a = 12</text>\n  <text x=\"207\" y=\"185\" font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\">34 + y = 39</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n## Key Notes for Accuracy\n- **Border Width**: Maintain 1px for all borders (critical for grid alignment).\n- **Cell Dimensions**: Ensure columns (200px) and rows (40px) are equal (excluding borders).\n- **Text Positioning**: Use 5px left padding and vertical centering (baseline at cell midpoints).\n- **Missing Space**: Reproduce `15 + a =17` (cell 4,2) exactly—this is a unique detail in the original image.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately reflect the structure, content, and style of the original image.",
  "v1_50": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this architectural floor plan, the following detailed description covers **geometric shapes, spatial relationships, fixtures, text, and stylistic conventions**—all critical for precise reconstruction. The plan is a **2D technical drawing** of a residential layout, using standard architectural symbols and a black-and-white color scheme.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe floor plan consists of **rectangular rooms** (with right-angle walls) connected by hallways, plus standard residential fixtures (plumbing, appliances) and exterior spaces (garages, porch, patio).

Key doors:\n- **Master Bedroom**: Right wall, 3’ from the top edge; swings inward (V points left).\n- **Bedroom 1 & 2**: Each has a door on their left wall (facing the hallway); swings inward (V points right).\n- **Bathroom 1**: Left wall (adjacent to the master bedroom); swings inward (V points right).\n- **Bathroom 2**: Left wall (facing the hallway); swings inward (V points right).\n- **Utility Room**: Left wall (facing the hallway); swings inward (V points right).\n- **Single Garage**: Left wall; overhead door (rectangle with a horizontal line).\n- **Double Garage**: Front wall (bottom edge of the plan); overhead door (rectangle with a horizontal line).\n- **Porch**: Right wall (connecting to the living room); swings inward (V points left).\n- **Patio**: Bottom wall (connecting to the kitchen); swings outward (V points up).\n\n### Windows\nWindows are represented by **short horizontal lines** (1–2’ long) along exterior walls. Key windows:\n- **Master Bedroom**: Two windows on the left wall, centered 4’ from the top and bottom edges.\n- **Bedroom 1 & 2**: One window each on their top wall (facing the patio).\n- **Living Room**: Two windows on the right wall, centered 4’ from the top and bottom edges.\n- **Porch**: One window on the front wall (bottom edge of the plan), centered.\n- **Patio**: Two windows on the top wall, centered 4’ from the left and right edges.\n\n### Fixtures\nFixtures use standard architectural symbols:\n- **Bathroom 1**: Toilet (circle with a vertical line) in the bottom-left corner; sink (rectangle with a small circle for a faucet) in the bottom-right corner; bathtub (long rectangle) along the right wall.\n- **Bathroom 2**: Toilet (circle with a vertical line) in the bottom-left corner; sink (rectangle with a small circle) in the bottom-right corner; shower (square with diagonal lines) along the right wall.\n- **Kitchen**: Stove (rectangle with four circles for burners) on the upper wall (facing the patio); sink (rectangle with a small circle) on the lower wall (facing the dining room); cabinets (short horizontal lines) on the left and right walls.\n- **Dining Room**: Rectangular table (center of the room) with four chairs (small rectangles) at each corner.\n- **Living Room**: Couch (rectangle with a curved backrest) on the right wall; coffee table (small rectangle) in front of the couch.\n- **Utility Room**: Washer/dryer (two side-by-side rectangles) in the center of the room.\n\n### Closets\n- **Master Bedroom Closet**: Not explicitly labeled, but the \"Closet\" room (middle-left) is a 4’ × 6’ rectangle with a door on its left wall (facing the hallway).\n- **Bedroom 1 & 2**: Each has a small closet (2’ × 4’) on their right wall (not labeled, but implied by the room’s dimensions).\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nThe floor plan uses a **monochromatic black-and-white color scheme** with:\n- **Background**: Solid white (RGB: #FFFFFF).\n- **Walls**: Thin black lines (1px width, RGB: #000000).\n- **Doors/Windows**: Black lines (1px width) for swing indicators and window lines.\n- **Fixtures**: Black symbols (1px width) for toilets, sinks, stoves, etc.\n- **Text**: Black sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for room names, dimensions, and total area.\n\nNo textures or shading are used—this is a technical drawing, not a rendered image.\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe floor plan is organized with **public spaces (living, dining, kitchen) on the right** and **private spaces (bedrooms, bathrooms) on the left**. Key adjacencies:\n- **Master Bedroom** is adjacent to Bathroom 1 (left wall) and the central hallway (right wall).\n- **Bedroom 1 & 2** are adjacent to each other (right wall of Bedroom 1 = left wall of Bedroom 2) and the central hallway (left wall of each).\n- **Bathroom 1** is adjacent to the master bedroom (right wall) and the central hallway (left wall).\n- **Bathroom 2** is adjacent to the central hallway (left wall) and the utility room (right wall).\n- **Utility Room** is adjacent to Bathroom 2 (left wall) and the double garage (right wall).\n- **Single & Double Garages** are adjacent to each other (right wall of the single garage = left wall of the double garage) and the central hallway (right wall of the double garage).\n- **Kitchen** is adjacent to the dining room (left wall) and the patio (top wall).\n- **Dining Room** is adjacent to the kitchen (right wall) and the living room (bottom wall).\n- **Living Room** is adjacent to the dining room (top wall) and the porch (bottom wall).\n- **Porch** is adjacent to the living room (right wall) and the front of the house (bottom wall).\n- **Patio** is adjacent to the kitchen (bottom wall) and the back of the house (top wall).\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe floor plan follows **technical architectural drawing conventions**:\n- **Linear Style**: All elements are drawn with thin black lines (1px width) on a white background.\n- **Right Angles**: All walls and rooms are axis-aligned (no diagonal walls).\n- **Minimalism**: No shading, textures, or 3D effects—focus on clarity and functionality.\n- **Symbol Consistency**: Uses standard symbols for doors, windows, fixtures, and appliances (per ANSI/AIAA standards).\n- **Scale**: Relative proportions are accurate (e.g., the living room is larger than the bedrooms).\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Text\nAll text uses a **sans-serif font** (e.g., Arial) in uppercase. Key text:\n- **Room Names**: Centered in each room (12pt font). Examples: \"MASTER BEDROOM\", \"LIVING ROOM\".\n- **Dimensions**: Placed in the **lower-right corner** of each room (10pt font). Examples: \"19 X 15\", \"12 X 11.5\".\n- **Total Garage Area**: \"(773 SQ FT)\" centered in the combined single/double garage space (10pt font).\n- **Patio/Dining Room**: \"PATIO\" (centered in the patio, 12pt font); \"DINING ROOM\" (centered in the dining room, 12pt font).\n\n### Symbols\n- **Toilet**: Circle with a vertical line (1’ diameter).\n- **Sink**: Rectangle (1’ × 0.5’) with a small circle (0.25’ diameter) for a faucet.\n- **Bathtub**: Rectangle (5’ × 2’) with a small circle (0.25’ diameter) for a faucet.\n- **Shower**: Square (3’ × 3’) with diagonal lines (1’ apart).\n- **Stove**: Rectangle (3’ × 2’) with four circles (0.5’ diameter) for burners.\n- **Washer/Dryer**: Two rectangles (2’ × 3’) side by side.\n- **Couch**: Rectangle (6’ × 3’) with a curved backrest (1’ tall).\n- **Coffee Table**: Rectangle (3’ × 2’) centered in front of the couch.\n\n### Specific Details\n- **Garage**: The single garage (14’ × 23.25’) and double garage (19’ × 21.23’) are combined into a single 773 sq ft space (total calculated as 14×23.25 + 19×21.23 = 325.5 + 403.37 = 728.87? Wait, the plan says 773 sq ft—likely a rounding error, but the text \"(773 SQ FT)\" must be included as-is.\n- **Porch**: The porch is a 8’ × 12’ rectangle with a door on its right wall (connecting to the living room) and a window on its front wall (bottom edge of the plan).\n- **Patio**: The patio is a 21’ × 12’ rectangle with a door on its bottom wall (connecting to the kitchen) and two windows on its top wall.\n\n\n## Key Measurements for SVG Reconstruction\nTo ensure accurate proportions, use the following **relative measurements** (scale: 1 unit = 1 foot):\n- **Master Bedroom**: 19 units wide (left-right) × 15 units tall (up-down).\n- **Living Room**: 21.5 units wide × 18.5 units tall.\n- **Hallway**: 3 units wide (consistent throughout).\n- **Doors**: 3 units wide (standard interior door).\n- **Windows**: 2 units wide (standard residential window).\n\n### Example Coordinates (Hypothetical)\nFor a 1000px × 1000px SVG canvas (scale: 1px = 0.1 foot):\n- **Master Bedroom**: Left = 0px, Top = 0px, Width = 190px (19’), Height = 150px (15’).\n- **Living Room**: Left = 500px, Top = 600px, Width = 215px (21.5’), Height = 185px (18.5’).\n- **Porch**: Left = 300px, Top = 800px, Width = 80px (8’), Height = 120px (12’).\n\n\n## Summary for SVG Recreation\nTo accurately recreate this floor plan as an SVG, focus on:\n1. **Geometric Precision**: Use rectangles for rooms, \"V\"-shapes for doors, and short lines for windows.\n2. **Symbol Consistency**: Follow standard architectural symbols for fixtures (toilet, sink, stove).\n3. **Text Placement**: Center room names and place dimensions in the lower-right corner of each room.\n4. **Spatial Relationships**: Ensure all rooms are adjacent to the correct hallways/other rooms (e.g., the kitchen is next to the dining room).\n5. **Scale**: Maintain relative proportions (e.g., the living room is larger than the bedrooms).\n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will be a precise, functional reproduction of the original floor plan.",

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nThe floor plan uses a **monochromatic black-and-white color scheme** with:\n- **Background**: Solid white (RGB: #FFFFFF).\n- **Walls**: Thin black lines (1px width, RGB: #000000).\n- **Doors/Windows**: Black lines (1px width) for swing indicators and window lines.\n- **Fixtures**: Black symbols (1px width) for toilets, sinks, stoves, etc.\n- **Text**: Black sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) for room names, dimensions, and total area.\n\nNo textures or shading are used—this is a technical drawing, not a rendered image.\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe floor plan is organized with **public spaces (living, dining, kitchen) on the right** and **private spaces (bedrooms, bathrooms) on the left**. Key adjacencies:\n- **Master Bedroom** is adjacent to Bathroom 1 (left wall) and the central hallway (right wall).\n- **Bedroom 1 & 2** are adjacent to each other (right wall of Bedroom 1 = left wall of Bedroom 2) and the central hallway (left wall of each).\n- **Bathroom 1** is adjacent to the master bedroom (right wall) and the central hallway (left wall).\n- **Bathroom 2** is adjacent to the central hallway (left wall) and the utility room (right wall).\n- **Utility Room** is adjacent to Bathroom 2 (left wall) and the double garage (right wall).\n- **Single & Double Garages** are adjacent to each other (right wall of the single garage = left wall of the double garage) and the central hallway (right wall of the double garage).\n- **Kitchen** is adjacent to the dining room (left wall) and the patio (top wall).\n- **Dining Room** is adjacent to the kitchen (right wall) and the living room (bottom wall).\n- **Living Room** is adjacent to the dining room (top wall) and the porch (bottom wall).\n- **Porch** is adjacent to the living room (right wall) and the front of the house (bottom wall).\n- **Patio** is adjacent to the kitchen (bottom wall) and the back of the house (top wall).\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe floor plan follows **technical architectural drawing conventions**:\n- **Linear Style**: All elements are drawn with thin black lines (1px width) on a white background.\n- **Right Angles**: All walls and rooms are axis-aligned (no diagonal walls).\n- **Minimalism**: No shading, textures, or 3D effects—focus on clarity and functionality.\n- **Symbol Consistency**: Uses standard symbols for doors, windows, fixtures, and appliances (per ANSI/AIAA standards).\n- **Scale**: Relative proportions are accurate (e.g., the living room is larger than the bedrooms).\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Text\nAll text uses a **sans-serif font** (e.g., Arial) in uppercase. Key text:\n- **Room Names**: Centered in each room (12pt font). Examples: \"MASTER BEDROOM\", \"LIVING ROOM\".\n- **Dimensions**: Placed in the **lower-right corner** of each room (10pt font). Examples: \"19 X 15\", \"12 X 11.5\".\n- **Total Garage Area**: \"(773 SQ FT)\" centered in the combined single/double garage space (10pt font).\n- **Patio/Dining Room**: \"PATIO\" (centered in the patio, 12pt font); \"DINING ROOM\" (centered in the dining room, 12pt font).\n\n### Symbols\n- **Toilet**: Circle with a vertical line (1’ diameter).\n- **Sink**: Rectangle (1’ × 0.5’) with a small circle (0.25’ diameter) for a faucet.\n- **Bathtub**: Rectangle (5’ × 2’) with a small circle (0.25’ diameter) for a faucet.\n- **Shower**: Square (3’ × 3’) with diagonal lines (1’ apart).\n- **Stove**: Rectangle (3’ × 2’) with four circles (0.5’ diameter) for burners.\n- **Washer/Dryer**: Two rectangles (2’ × 3’) side by side.\n- **Couch**: Rectangle (6’ × 3’) with a curved backrest (1’ tall).\n- **Coffee Table**: Rectangle (3’ × 2’) centered in front of the couch.\n\n### Specific Details\n- **Garage**: The single garage (14’ × 23.25’) and double garage (19’ × 21.23’) are combined into a single 773 sq ft space (total calculated as 14×23.25 + 19×21.23 = 325.5 + 403.37 = 728.87? Wait, the plan says 773 sq ft—likely a rounding error, but the text \"(773 SQ FT)\" must be included as-is.\n- **Porch**: The porch is a 8’ × 12’ rectangle with a door on its right wall (connecting to the living room) and a window on its front wall (bottom edge of the plan).\n- **Patio**: The patio is a 21’ × 12’ rectangle with a door on its bottom wall (connecting to the kitchen) and two windows on its top wall.\n\n\n## Key Measurements for SVG Reconstruction\nTo ensure accurate proportions, use the following **relative measurements** (scale: 1 unit = 1 foot):\n- **Master Bedroom**: 19 units wide (left-right) × 15 units tall (up-down).\n- **Living Room**: 21.5 units wide × 18.5 units tall.\n- **Hallway**: 3 units wide (consistent throughout).\n- **Doors**: 3 units wide (standard interior door).\n- **Windows**: 2 units wide (standard residential window).\n\n### Example Coordinates (Hypothetical)\nFor a 1000px × 1000px SVG canvas (scale: 1px = 0.1 foot):\n- **Master Bedroom**: Left = 0px, Top = 0px, Width = 190px (19’), Height = 150px (15’).\n- **Living Room**: Left = 500px, Top = 600px, Width = 215px (21.5’), Height = 185px (18.5’).\n- **Porch**: Left = 300px, Top = 800px, Width = 80px (8’), Height = 120px (12’).\n\n\n## Summary for SVG Recreation\nTo accurately recreate this floor plan as an SVG, focus on:\n1. **Geometric Precision**: Use rectangles for rooms, \"V\"-shapes for doors, and short lines for windows.\n2. **Symbol Consistency**: Follow standard architectural symbols for fixtures (toilet, sink, stove).\n3. **Text Placement**: Center room names and place dimensions in the lower-right corner of each room.\n4. **Spatial Relationships**: Ensure all rooms are adjacent to the correct hallways/other rooms (e.g., the kitchen is next to the dining room).\n5. **Scale**: Maintain relative proportions (e.g., the living room is larger than the bedrooms).\n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will be a precise, functional reproduction of the original floor plan.",

Center: (190, 460). |\n\n#### **Arrow Positions**\nArrows connect nodes with consistent gaps:  \n- **Start → 1st Decision**: Vertical arrow (20px length) from start node’s bottom (y=60) to 1st decision node’s top (y=80).  \n- **1st Decision → \"Plug in Lamp\"**: Horizontal arrow (30px length) from 1st decision node’s right edge (x=270) to action node’s left edge (x=300).  \n- **1st Decision → 2nd Decision**: Vertical arrow (20px length) from 1st decision node’s bottom (y=240) to 2nd decision node’s top (y=260).  \n- **2nd Decision → \"Replace Bulb\"**: Horizontal arrow (30px length) from 2nd decision node’s right edge (x=270) to action node’s left edge (x=300).  \n- **2nd Decision → \"Repair Lamp\"**: Vertical arrow (20px length) from 2nd decision node’s bottom (y=420) to action node’s top (y=440).  \n\n#### **\"Yes\"/\"No\" Label Positions**\nLabels are positioned **above** their respective arrows, centered:  \n- **\"No\" (1st Decision → \"Plug in Lamp\")**: (285, 150) (center of the 30px horizontal arrow).  \n- **\"Yes\" (1st Decision → 2nd Decision)**: (190, 250) (center of the 20px vertical arrow).  \n- **\"Yes\" (2nd Decision → \"Replace Bulb\")**: (285, 330) (center of the 30px horizontal arrow).  \n- **\"No\" (2nd Decision → \"Repair Lamp\")**: (190, 430) (center of the 20px vertical arrow).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Standard Flow Chart Notation**:  \n  - Start node: Rounded rectangle (pink).  \n  - Decision nodes: Diamonds (yellow).  \n  - Action nodes: Rounded rectangles (green).  \n- **Consistency**:  \n  - All rounded rectangles use a **10px border radius**.  \n  - All arrowheads are **8px × 8px filled triangles** (consistent size).  \n  - Gaps between nodes are uniform (20px vertical, 30px horizontal) for a clean layout.  \n- **Readability**:  \n  - Bold, sans-serif text (e.g., Arial) ensures clarity.  \n  - High-contrast colors (pink/yellow/green) distinguish node types at a glance.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text is **centered** in its shape. Key text elements:  \n\n| Element             | Text Content          | Font Size | FontWeight | Color |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------|------------|-------|\n| Start Node          | \"Lamp doesn't work\"   | 14px      | Bold       | Black |\n| 1st Decision Node   | \"Lamp plugged in?\"    | 14px      | Bold       | Black |\n| 2nd Decision Node   | \"Bulb burned out?\"    | 14px      | Bold       | Black |\n| \"Plug in Lamp\"      | \"Plug in lamp\"        | 14px      | Bold       | Black |\n| \"Replace Bulb\"      | \"Replace bulb\"        | 14px      | Bold       | Black |\n| \"Repair Lamp\"       | \"Repair lamp\"         | 14px      | Bold       | Black |\n| \"Yes\"/\"No\" Labels   | \"Yes\" / \"No\"          | 12px      | Bold       | Black |\n\n#### **Critical SVG Notes**\n- **Diamonds**: Represented as `<polygon>` elements with four points (e.g., 1st decision node: `points=\"190,80 270,160 190,240 110,160\"`).  \n- **Arrowheads**: Created with `<polygon>` elements (e.g., right-pointing arrowhead: `points=\"300,160 292,156 292,164\"`).  \n- **Font**: Use `font-family: sans-serif` to match the clean, modern style.  \n- **Responsiveness**: For scalability, use relative units (e.g., `em`) or define a viewBox (e.g., `viewBox=\"0 0 500 500\"`).  \n\n\n### **Summary of Layout Logic**\nThe chart follows a **top-to-bottom, left-to-right** flow:  \n1. **Start**: \"Lamp doesn't work\" (pink rounded rectangle) at the top.  \n2. **1st Decision**: \"Lamp plugged in?\" (yellow diamond) below the start node.  \n   - **No**: Redirects to \"Plug in lamp\" (green action node) to the right.  \n   - **Yes**: Proceeds to the 2nd decision node below.  \n3. **2nd Decision**: \"Bulb burned out?\" (yellow diamond) below the 1st decision node.  \n   - **Yes**: Redirects to \"Replace bulb\" (green action node) to the right.  \n   - **No**: Proceeds to \"Repair lamp\" (green action node) at the bottom.  \n\nThis layout ensures logical progression and easy readability, with consistent spacing and color coding to guide the user through the troubleshooting process.\n\n\n### **SVG Template Skeleton**\nTo recreate the chart, use this structure (adjust coordinates/units as needed):  \n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 500 500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Start Node: \"Lamp doesn't work\" -->\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"20\" width=\"180\" height=\"40\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#FFD1DC\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"190\" y=\"40\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Lamp doesn't work</text>\n\n  <!-- 1st Decision Node: \"Lamp plugged in?\" -->\n  <polygon points=\"190,80 270,160 190,240 110,160\" fill=\"#FFFF99\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"190\" y=\"160\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Lamp plugged in?</text>\n\n  <!-- Arrow: Start → 1st Decision -->\n  <line x1=\"190\" y1=\"60\" x2=\"190\" y2=\"80\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <polygon points=\"190,80 182,76 182,84\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n\n  <!-- Action Node: \"Plug in lamp\" -->\n  <rect x=\"300\" y=\"140\" width=\"150\" height=\"40\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#98FB98\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"375\" y=\"160\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Plug in lamp</text>\n\n  <!-- Arrow: 1st Decision → \"Plug in lamp\" (No) -->\n  <line x1=\"270\" y1=\"160\" x2=\"300\" y2=\"160\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <polygon points=\"300,160 292,156 292,164\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <text x=\"285\" y=\"150\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">No</text>\n\n  <!-- Arrow: 1st Decision → 2nd Decision (Yes) -->\n  <line x1=\"190\" y1=\"240\" x2=\"190\" y2=\"260\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <polygon points=\"190,260 182,256 182,264\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <text x=\"190\" y=\"250\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Yes</text>\n\n  <!-- 2nd Decision Node: \"Bulb burned out?\" -->\n  <polygon points=\"190,260 270,340 190,420 110,340\" fill=\"#FFFF99\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"190\" y=\"340\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Bulb burned out?</text>\n\n  <!-- Action Node: \"Replace bulb\" -->\n  <rect x=\"300\" y=\"320\" width=\"140\" height=\"40\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#98FB98\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"370\" y=\"340\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Replace bulb</text>\n\n  <!-- Arrow: 2nd Decision → \"Replace bulb\" (Yes) -->\n  <line x1=\"270\" y1=\"340\" x2=\"300\" y2=\"340\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <polygon points=\"300,340 292,336 292,344\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <text x=\"285\" y=\"330\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Yes</text>\n\n  <!-- Action Node: \"Repair lamp\" -->\n  <rect x=\"125\" y=\"440\" width=\"130\" height=\"40\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\" fill=\"#98FB98\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"190\" y=\"460\" font-size=\"14px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">Repair lamp</text>\n\n  <!-- Arrow: 2nd Decision → \"Repair lamp\" (No) -->\n  <line x1=\"190\" y1=\"420\" x2=\"190\" y2=\"440\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <polygon points=\"190,440 182,436 182,444\" fill=\"#000000\"/>\n  <text x=\"190\" y=\"430\" font-size=\"12px\" font-weight=\"bold\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">No</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\nThis template includes all critical elements (shapes, colors, text, arrows) and follows the layout logic described. Adjust coordinates or units (e.g., `px` to `em`) for responsiveness, and ensure the viewBox covers the entire chart (e.g., `viewBox=\"0 0 500 500\"`).",
  "v1_53": "To recreate this flowchart accurately as an SVG, below is a comprehensive, technical description of its structure, elements, and visual properties. The description adheres to standard flowchart conventions (ISO 5807) and includes precise geometric details, proportions, and layout instructions.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **vertical flowchart** depicting a tea-making process. It uses standard flowchart symbols:  \n- **Ellipses**: For *Start* (top) and *Stop* (bottom) nodes.  \n- **Rectangles**: For process steps (e.g., \"Turn on kettle\").  \n- **Diamond**: For a decision point (\"Water boiled?\").  \n- **Arrows**: To indicate the flow of logic, with labels for decision outcomes (\"Y\" = Yes, \"N\" = No).  \n\n#### Key Nodes (Top-to-Bottom Order):\n1. **Start** (ellipse)  \n2. **Turn on kettle** (rectangle)  \n3. **Wait for kettle to boil** (rectangle)  \n4. **Water boiled?** (diamond, decision point)  \n5. **Wait** (rectangle, loop subprocess)  \n6. **Pour water on teabag in cup** (rectangle)  \n7. **Wait 2-3 min** (rectangle)  \n8. **Add milk and sugar** (rectangle)  \n9. **Stop** (ellipse)  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll nodes have a **1px solid black border** and flat, solid fills (no gradients). Text is consistent across all nodes.  \n\n| Element               | Fill Color       | Text Style                          |\n|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Start Ellipse         | Light Green      | Sans-serif (e.g., Arial), 16px, black, centered |\n| Stop Ellipse          | Light Pink       | Same as above                        |\n| Process Rectangles    | Light Yellow     | Same as above                        |\n| Decision Diamond      | Orange           | Same as above                        |\n| Arrows                | Black (2px line) | —                                    |\n| Arrowheads            | Black (filled)   | —                                    |\n\n#### Color Codes (Hex):\n- Start: `#98FB98` (Pale Green)  \n- Stop: `#FFC0CB` (Pale Pink)  \n- Processes: `#FFFFE0` (Light Yellow)  \n- Decision: `#FFA500` (Orange)  \n- Borders/Arrows: `#000000` (Black)  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe flowchart is **centered vertically and horizontally** on a canvas (suggested size: `800px × 1000px`). Nodes are evenly spaced, with consistent vertical gaps between them. The decision node introduces a **loop** (via the \"Wait\" node) to the right of the main flow.  \n\n#### Canvas Setup:\n- **Width**: `800px` (to accommodate the right-aligned \"Wait\" node).  \n- **Height**: `1000px` (to fit all nodes with vertical spacing).  \n- **Center**: `(400px, 500px)` (horizontal/vertical midpoint).  \n\n#### Node Dimensions & Positions:\nAll measurements are relative to the canvas’s top-left corner (`(0,0)`).  \n\n| Node                  | Shape       | Width (px) | Height (px) | Center Coordinates (x, y) | Bounding Box (x1, y1, x2, y2) |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Start                 | Ellipse     | 200        | 80          | (400, 100)                | (300, 60, 500, 140)          |\n| Turn on kettle        | Rectangle   | 250        | 60          | (400, 230)                | (275, 200, 525, 260)         |\n| Wait for kettle to boil | Rectangle | 250        | 60          | (400, 350)                | (275, 320, 525, 380)         |\n| Water boiled?         | Diamond     | 180        | 180         | (400, 500)                | (310, 410, 490, 590)         |\n| Wait                  | Rectangle   | 150        | 60          | (675, 500)                | (600, 470, 750, 530)         |\n| Pour water on teabag  | Rectangle   | 250        | 60          | (400, 680)                | (275, 650, 525, 710)         |\n| Wait 2-3 min          | Rectangle   | 250        | 60          | (400, 770)                | (275, 740, 525, 800)         |\n| Add milk and sugar    | Rectangle   | 250        | 60          | (400, 860)                | (275, 830, 525, 890)         |\n| Stop                  | Ellipse     | 200        | 80          | (400, 950)                | (300, 910, 500, 990)         |\n\n#### Critical Notes on Shapes:\n- **Ellipses** (Start/Stop): Wider than tall (aspect ratio: 2.5:1).  \n- **Rectangles** (Processes): Wider than tall (aspect ratio: ~4.17:1) for readability.  \n- **Diamond** (Decision): A perfect square rotated 45° (so its bounding box is 180px × 180px). The unrotated square is ~127px × 127px (calculated as `180 / √2`).  \n\n\n### **4. Flow and Spatial Logic**\nThe flowchart follows a **vertical top-to-bottom flow** with a single loop (for the decision point). Below is a breakdown of the flow and arrow connections:  \n\n#### Main Flow (Vertical):\n`Start` → `Turn on kettle` → `Wait for kettle to boil` → `Water boiled?` (decision) → [If **Yes**] → `Pour water on teabag` → `Wait 2-3 min` → `Add milk and sugar` → `Stop`.  \n\n#### Loop (Decision Branch):\n[If **No** to \"Water boiled?\"] → `Wait` → `Wait for kettle to boil` (repeat until water boils).  \n\n#### Arrow Details:\nAll arrows are **2px solid black** with **filled triangular arrowheads** (6px base × 4px height). Arrowheads point in the direction of flow.  \n\n| From Node             | To Node               | Arrow Path (Coordinates)                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Start                 | Turn on kettle        | Vertical line: `(400, 140)` (bottom of Start) → `(400, 200)` (top of \"Turn on kettle\").  |\n| Turn on kettle        | Wait for kettle to boil | Vertical line: `(400, 260)` (bottom of \"Turn on kettle\") → `(400, 320)` (top of \"Wait for kettle\"). |\n| Wait for kettle to boil | Water boiled?        | Vertical line: `(400, 380)` (bottom of \"Wait for kettle\") → `(400, 410)` (top of diamond). |\n| Water boiled? (N)     | Wait                  | Horizontal line: `(490, 500)` (right vertex of diamond) → `(600, 500)` (left edge of \"Wait\"). |\n| Wait                  | Wait for kettle to boil | Two-segment line: `(600, 500)` (left edge of \"Wait\") → `(525, 500)` (right edge of \"Wait for kettle\") → `(525, 350)` (middle of \"Wait for kettle\"’s right edge). |\n| Water boiled? (Y)     | Pour water on teabag  | Vertical line: `(400, 590)` (bottom vertex of diamond) → `(400, 650)` (top of \"Pour water\"). |\n| Pour water on teabag  | Wait 2-3 min          | Vertical line: `(400, 710)` (bottom of \"Pour water\") → `(400, 740)` (top of \"Wait 2-3 min\"). |\n| Wait 2-3 min          | Add milk and sugar    | Vertical line: `(400, 800)` (bottom of \"Wait 2-3 min\") → `(400, 830)` (top of \"Add milk\"). |\n| Add milk and sugar    | Stop                  | Vertical line: `(400, 890)` (bottom of \"Add milk\") → `(400, 910)` (top of Stop).          |\n\n#### Decision Node Labels:\n- **\"Y\" (Yes)**: Centered below the diamond at `(400, 600)` (10px below the diamond’s bottom vertex).  \n- **\"N\" (No)**: Centered to the right of the diamond at `(550, 500)` (60px to the right of the diamond’s right vertex).  \n\n\n### **5. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe flowchart uses a **minimalist, functional style** with no decorative elements. Key style rules:  \n- **Consistency**: All process rectangles have the same dimensions; all ellipses have the same dimensions.  \n- **Readability**: Text is centered in all nodes (sans-serif, 16px) for clarity.  \n- **Loop Visualization**: The \"Wait\" node is offset to the right of the main flow, with an arrow looping back to the \"Wait for kettle to boil\" node to emphasize repetition.  \n- **Alignment**: All nodes in the main flow are **horizontally centered** (x = 400px) for a clean, balanced layout.  \n\n\n### **6. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text**: All node text is **black, sans-serif (e.g., Arial)**, 16px, and centered. No bold/italic styles are used.  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - Ellipses = Start/Stop (standard flowchart convention).  \n  - Rectangles = Processes (actions to perform).  \n  - Diamond = Decision (binary \"Yes/No\" question).  \n- **Loop Indication**: The \"Wait\" node’s arrow returning to \"Wait for kettle to boil\" clearly marks a **repeat loop** (continue waiting until water boils).  \n\n\n### **7. SVG-Specific Implementation Notes**\nTo recreate this in SVG, use the following tags and attributes:  \n\n#### Ellipses (Start/Stop):\n```svg\n<ellipse cx=\"400\" cy=\"100\" rx=\"100\" ry=\"40\" fill=\"#98FB98\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"105\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Start</text>\n</ellipse>\n```\n- `rx` = half the width (200px ÷ 2 = 100px).  \n- `ry` = half the height (80px ÷ 2 = 40px).  \n- Text is vertically centered by adjusting `y` to `cy + 5` (compensates for font baseline).  \n\n#### Rectangles (Processes):\n```svg\n<rect x=\"275\" y=\"200\" width=\"250\" height=\"60\" fill=\"#FFFFE0\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"235\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Turn on kettle</text>\n</rect>\n```\n- `x` = center x - (width ÷ 2) (400 - 125 = 275).  \n- `y` = center y - (height ÷ 2) (230 - 30 = 200).  \n- Text is vertically centered by adjusting `y` to `y + (height ÷ 2) + 5` (200 + 30 + 5 = 235).  \n\n#### Diamond (Decision Node):\n```svg\n<rect x=\"310\" y=\"410\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" transform=\"rotate(45 400 500)\" fill=\"#FFA500\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"1\">\n  <text x=\"400\" y=\"505\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"16\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Water boiled?</text>\n</rect>\n```\n- The diamond is a square rotated 45° around its center (`(400, 500)`).  \n- `x` = center x - (width ÷ 2) (400 - 90 = 310).  \n- `y` = center y - (height ÷ 2) (500 - 90 = 410).  \n- Text is vertically centered by adjusting `y` to `cy + 5` (500 + 5 = 505).  \n\n#### Arrows:\nUse `<line>` tags with `marker-end` for arrowheads. Define a marker for arrowheads:  \n```svg\n<defs>\n  <marker id=\"arrowhead\" markerWidth=\"6\" markerHeight=\"4\" refX=\"6\" refY=\"2\" orient=\"auto\">\n    <polygon points=\"0 0, 6 2, 0 4\" fill=\"#000000\" />\n  </marker>\n</defs>\n\n<!-- Example Arrow: Start → Turn on Kettle -->\n<line x1=\"400\" y1=\"140\" x2=\"400\" y2=\"200\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\" />\n```\n- `marker-end` attaches the arrowhead to the end of the line.  \n- `refX=\"6\"` aligns the arrowhead’s tip with the line’s endpoint.  \n\n#### Loop Arrow (Wait → Wait for Kettle to Boil):\nUse a `<path>` tag for the two-segment arrow:  \n```svg\n<path d=\"M 600 500 L 525 500 L 525 350\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\" marker-end=\"url(#arrowhead)\" />\n```\n- `M` = Move to (start of arrow: left edge of \"Wait\" node).  \n- `L` = Line to (first segment: left to right edge of \"Wait for kettle\" node).  \n- `L` = Line to (second segment: up to middle of \"Wait for kettle\" node’s right edge).  \n\n\n### **Final SVG Structure**\nThe SVG will have a `<defs>` section for the arrowhead marker, followed by all nodes (ellipses, rectangles) in top-to-bottom order, then all arrows (lines/paths) with the arrowhead marker.  \n\nThis description provides **pixel-perfect instructions** for recreating the flowchart in SVG, including dimensions, positions, colors, and style. The layout is designed for clarity and adherence to standard flowchart practices, ensuring the SVG is both functional and visually consistent.",
  "v1_54": "To accurately recreate this flowchart as an SVG, below is a comprehensive, technical description covering all visual and structural details. The breakdown follows the user’s requirements, with a focus on **geometric precision**, **color values**, **spatial relationships**, and **style consistency**—critical for SVG rendering.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image is a **standard flowchart** using traditional symbols. Key elements include:\n\n| Element Type | Shapes | Examples |\n|--------------|--------|----------|\n| **Terminators** (start/end) | Rectangles (sharp corners) | `START`, `END` |\n| **Process Nodes** | Rectangles (sharp corners) | `Alarm Rings`, `Hit Snooze Button`, `Climb Out of Bed` |\n| **Process Node (Delayed Action)** | Rounded rectangle (border radius = ½ height) | `Delay` |\n| **Decision Node** | Diamond (rotated square, width = height) | `Ready to get up?` |\n| **Connectors** | Arrows (line + triangle head) | All directional links between nodes |\n| **Text** | Inline labels/annotations | Node titles (e.g., `START`), decision labels (e.g., `YES`/`NO!`), context notes (e.g., `Set for 5 minutes`) |\n\n\n## 2.

Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Flowchart Standards**: Adheres to ISO 5807 (traditional symbols for terminators, processes, decisions).  \n- **Color Logic**:  \n  - Blue (`START`/`END`): Indicates the beginning/end of the process.  \n  - Red (process nodes): Highlights active actions (e.g., `Alarm Rings`, `Hit Snooze Button`).  \n  - Green (decision node): Draws attention to the critical choice point.  \n  - Orange (`Delay`): Differentiates a timed process from immediate actions.  \n- **Layout**: Vertical main path with a right-branching decision—typical for linear processes with alternative paths.  \n- **Minimalism**: No decorative elements (gradients, shadows); focus on **clarity** for technical communication.  \n- **Arrow Consistency**: All arrows use a 2px stem and 8px triangle head for uniform visibility.\n\n\n## 5. Key SVG Notes for Accurate Recreation\n- **Diamond Rotation**: The decision node is a square rotated 45° around its center (`transform=\"rotate(45 160 260)\"`), where `160 260` is the diamond’s center coordinates.  \n- **Rounded Corners**: The `Delay` node uses `rx=\"20\" ry=\"20\"` (half its height) for a standard \"rounded rectangle\" look.  \n- **Text Alignment**: All node labels use `text-anchor=\"middle\"` and `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"` to center text horizontally/vertically within the shape.  \n- **Viewport**: The `viewBox=\"0 0 600 500\"` ensures all elements are visible and properly scaled.  \n- **Stroke Widths**: Arrows use a 2px stroke—thick enough for visibility but not bulky.  \n\n\n## Final SVG Structure\nCombine all elements into a single SVG file, maintaining the order above (background elements first, foreground elements last). The final code will look like this (abbreviated for brevity):\n\n```svg\n<svg width=\"600\" height=\"500\" viewBox=\"0 0 600 500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Main Vertical Path -->\n  <rect x=\"100\" y=\"20\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0066CC\"/>\n  <text x=\"160\" y=\"40\" font-family=\"sans-serif\" font-size=\"16px\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\">START</text>\n  <line x1=\"160\" y1=\"60\" x2=\"160\" y2=\"90\" stroke=\"#FFA500\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n  <polygon points=\"156 84, 160 90, 164 84\" fill=\"#FFA500\"/>\n  <!-- ...

The coordinates, colors, and shapes are optimized for clarity and adherence to flowchart standards, ensuring the final render matches the original image exactly.",
  "v1_55": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description of its components, layout, and visual properties:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **line graph** comparing three U.S. nationwide economic metrics over time, accompanied by a title, legend, and axis labels. Key elements include:  \n- **Title**: \"US Nationwide:\" (top-left).  \n- **Legend**: Three entries (blue, orange, red) mapping colors to metrics (left-aligned below the title).  \n- **Axis Labels**:  \n  - **Y-axis**: \"Growth rate:\" (above the axis) and percentage values (`0`, `50%`, `100%`, `150%`) on the left.  \n  - **X-axis**: Years (`1960`, `1970`, `1980`, `1990`, `2000`, `2008`, `2010`, `2017`) at the bottom.  \n- **Graph Lines**: Three solid lines (blue, orange, red) connecting data points.  \n- **Data Points**: Solid circles (radius = 3px) at each year, matching the line color.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n| Element | Color (Hex) | Texture/Style |\n|---------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Title Text** | `#000000` (black) | Sans-serif, bold, 14pt. |\n| **Legend Text** | `#000000` | Sans-serif, regular, 10pt. |\n| **Axis Labels (Y/X)** | `#000000` | Sans-serif, regular, 10pt. |\n| **Blue Line/Data Points** | `#0071C5` (dark blue) | Solid line (2px), solid circle (radius 3px). |\n| **Orange Line/Data Points** | `#FFA500` (orange) | Solid line (2px), solid circle (radius 3px). |\n| **Red Line/Data Points** | `#FF0000` (red) | Solid line (2px), solid circle (radius 3px). |\n| **Axes Lines** | `#000000` | Solid line (1px). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nAssume a **500x500px canvas** with margins for text and labels. Below is a coordinate system (**top-left origin**) for key elements:  \n\n#### **Title**  \n- \"US Nationwide:\" positioned at `(50, 20)` (left-margin: 50px, top-margin: 20px).  \n\n#### **Legend**  \nThree horizontal entries, left-aligned below the title. Each entry has a circle (3px radius) followed by text:  \n- **Blue**: Circle at `(50, 60)`, text \"Median House Price\" at `(70, 60)`.  \n- **Orange**: Circle at `(50, 80)`, text \"Median Gross Rent per Month\" at `(70, 80)`.  \n- **Red**: Circle at `(50, 100)`, text \"Median Household Income\" at `(70, 100)`.  \n\n#### **Y-Axis**  \n- **Line**: Vertical line from `(50, 150)` (top, 150% label) to `(50, 450)` (bottom, 0% label).  \n- **Labels**:  \n  - `150%` at `(30, 150)` (left of the axis, aligned with the top).  \n  - `100%` at `(30, 250)` (middle-top).  \n  - `50%` at `(30, 350)` (middle-bottom).  \n  - `0` at `(30, 450)` (bottom, aligned with the x-axis).  \n- **\"Growth rate:\"**: Text at `(50, 120)` (above the y-axis, left-aligned).  \n\n#### **X-Axis**  \n- **Line**: Horizontal line from `(50, 450)` (left, 1960) to `(425, 450)` (right, 2017).  \n- **Labels**: Years centered below the axis line, at the x-coordinate of their data point:  \n  - `1960` at `(100, 470)`  \n  - `1970` at `(150, 470)`  \n  - `1980` at `(200, 470)`  \n  - `1990` at `(250, 470)`  \n  - `2000` at `(300, 470)`  \n  - `2008` at `(350, 470)`  \n  - `2010` at `(375, 470)`  \n  - `2017` at `(425, 470)`  \n\n#### **Data Points & Lines**  \nEach line connects data points at the specified years. The y-coordinate of each point corresponds to the growth rate (**0% = 450px, 150% = 150px**; 1% = ~2.67px). Below are the **(x, y)** coordinates for each data point:  \n\n| Metric | 1960 | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2008 | 2010 | 2017 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Median House Price (Blue)** | `(100, 450)` (0%) | `(150, 400)` (~12.5%) | `(200, 350)` (50%) | `(250, 350)` (50%) | `(300, 300)` (75%) | `(350, 150)` (125%) | `(375, 250)` (100%) | `(425, 225)` (~112.5%) |\n| **Median Gross Rent (Orange)** | `(100, 450)` (0%) | `(150, 425)` (~6.25%) | `(200, 375)` (25%) | `(250, 325)` (43.75%) | `(300, 310)` (~47.5%) | `(350, 275)` (62.5%) | `(375, 275)` (62.5%) | `(425, 250)` (75%) |\n| **Median Household Income (Red)** | `(100, 450)` (0%) | `(150, 410)` (~10%) | `(200, 430)` (~5%) | `(250, 400)` (~12.5%) | `(300, 380)` (~17.5%) | `(350, 360)` (~22.5%) | `(375, 370)` (~20%) | `(425, 350)` (~25%) |\n\n- **Lines**: Connect consecutive data points for each metric (e.g., blue line connects `(100,450)` → `(150,400)` → `(200,350)`, etc.).  \n- **Z-Order**: Lines are drawn above the axes; data points are drawn above the lines (to be visible).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalist/Professional**: Clean layout with no grid lines, borders, or decorative elements.  \n- **Data-Centric**: Emphasizes the three lines and their trends, with clear labeling for readability.  \n- **Uneven X-Axis Spacing**: Years are not evenly spaced (e.g., 2000–2008 is 8 years, 2008–2010 is 2 years) to highlight specific events (e.g., 2008 financial crisis).  \n- **Line Weight**: Data lines are thicker (2px) than axes (1px) to draw attention to the trends.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text Alignment**: All text (title, legend, axes) is left-aligned except x-axis year labels (centered).  \n- **Legend Order**: Matches the line order in the graph (blue = highest peak, red = lowest trend).  \n- **Data Point Consistency**: Every year has a data point (no missing values).  \n- **Axis Limits**: Y-axis ranges from 0% to 150% (no negative values); x-axis ranges from 1960 to 2017 (inclusive).  \n\n\n### **Key SVG Considerations for Recreation**\n- **Coordinate System**: Use a top-left origin (standard for SVG).  \n- **Line Drawing**: Use `<line>` elements for axes and `<polyline>` for data lines (with `stroke` matching the line color, `stroke-width=\"2\"`, `fill=\"none\"`).  \n- **Data Points**: Use `<circle>` elements with `cx`/`cy` set to the coordinates above, `r=\"3\"`, and `fill` matching the line color.  \n- **Text**: Use `<text>` elements with `font-family=\"Arial, sans-serif\"`, `font-size`, and `fill=\"#000000\"`.  \n- **Margins**: Reserve 50px on the left (for text) and 50px on the bottom (for x-axis labels) to avoid clipping.  \n\nExample SVG snippet for the blue line:  \n```svg\n<polyline points=\"100,450 150,400 200,350 250,350 300,300 350,150 375,250 425,225\" stroke=\"#0071C5\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\"/>\n<circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"450\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#0071C5\"/>\n<circle cx=\"150\" cy=\"400\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#0071C5\"/>\n<!-- Repeat circles for all blue data points -->\n```\n\nThis description provides all the geometric, stylistic, and layout details needed to accurately reproduce the image as an SVG.",

Line Chart: Data & Geometry**\nThe core of the infographic is a **line chart** showing gold medals won by Team GB in 5 sports (1996–2016).  \n\n### **Axes**\n- **Y-Axis (Vertical)**:  \n  - **Scale**: `0–9` gold medals (integer increments).  \n  - **Position**: Left edge of the chart (`x=50px`).  \n  - **Ticks**: Numerical values (`0` to `9`) aligned **right** of the axis (10pt, black).  \n  - **Grid Lines**: Horizontal light gray (`#E0E0E0`) lines at each tick, spanning from the y-axis to the right edge of the chart (`x=750px`).  \n\n- **X-Axis (Horizontal)**:  \n  - **Labels**: 6 Olympic games (1996–2016), each with a **national flag** (host country) and text (city + year).  \n  - **Position**: Bottom of the chart (`y=450px`).  \n  - **Spacing**: 6 data points (1996–2016) with **140px intervals** (800px width ÷ 5 gaps = 140px per interval).  \n  - **Flag Dimensions**: `12px (width) × 8px (height)` (recreated with `<rect>` and `<path>` for scalability).  \n  - **Label Text**: \"Atlanta 1996\", \"Sydney 2000\", etc. (10pt, black, centered below each flag).  \n\n| Year  | Host City | Flag (Host Country) | X-Position (Tick Center) |\n|-------|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1996  | Atlanta   | USA                 | `x=160px`                |\n| 2000  | Sydney    | Australia           | `x=300px`                |\n| 2004  | Athens    | Greece              | `x=440px`                |\n| 2008  | Beijing   | China               | `x=580px`                |\n| 2012  | London    | UK                  | `x=720px`                |\n| 2016  | Rio       | Brazil              | `x=860px` (adjusted for 800px width: `x=760px`) |\n\n### **Data Points & Lines**\nEach sport has a **solid line** (2px thick) connecting **circular data points** (6px diameter). The line color matches the legend swatch.  \n\n#### **Exact Data Table (Critical for SVG)**\n| Sport      | 1996 (x=160px) | 2000 (x=300px) | 2004 (x=440px) | 2008 (x=580px) | 2012 (x=720px) | 2016 (x=760px) |\n|------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| **Rowing** (red) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=370px` (2 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=370px` (2 medals) | `y=290px` (4 medals) | `y=330px` (3 medals) |\n| **Cycling** (orange) | `y=450px` (0 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=370px` (2 medals) | `y=50px` (8 medals) | `y=50px` (8 medals) | `y=170px` (6 medals) |\n| **Athletics** (yellow) | `y=450px` (0 medals) | `y=370px` (2 medals) | `y=330px` (3 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=290px` (4 medals) | `y=370px` (2 medals) |\n| **Sailing** (blue) | `y=330px` (3 medals) | `y=330px` (3 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=290px` (4 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=370px` (2 medals) |\n| **Boxing** (green) | `y=450px` (0 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=450px` (0 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) | `y=330px` (3 medals) | `y=410px` (1 medal) |\n\n#### **Key Geometry Rules**\n- **Y-Axis Scale**: `y=450px` = 0 medals (bottom of the chart), `y=50px` = 9 medals (top of the chart). Each tick is **40px apart** (400px height ÷ 10 ticks = 40px per medal).  \n- **Line Drawing**: Connect data points in sequence (1996 → 2000 → 2004 → 2008 → 2012 → 2016) using `<line>` or `<path>` elements.  \n- **Data Point Precision**: Circles are centered exactly at the intersection of the x-tick (year) and y-value (medals).\n\n\n## **5. Olympic Rings (Left Side)**\nA set of **5 interlocking gray circles** (official Olympic ring design) positioned to the left of the 1996 data point.  \n- **Dimensions**: Each circle has a **40px diameter** and **2px stroke** (`#CCCCCC`).  \n- **Position**: Center of the first ring (leftmost) at `(x=50px, y=250px)` (vertical center of the chart).  \n- **Overlap**: Rings interlock per Olympic guidelines (each ring overlaps the next by 10px).  \n- **Visibility**: Spans from `y=210px` (bottom of the lowest ring) to `y=290px` (top of the highest ring).\n\n\n## **6. Sport Icons (2016 Data Points)**\nThree outline icons (16px × 16px) are placed **10px to the right** of the 2016 data points for the top three sports (Cycling, Rowing, Sailing).  \n- **Cycling**: Bicycle icon (`x=770px, y=170px`).  \n- **Rowing**: Oars icon (`x=770px, y=330px`).  \n- **Sailing**: Sailboat icon (`x=770px, y=370px`).  \n- **Style**: Light gray (`#999999`), 1px stroke, no fill.  \n- **Source**: Use open-source SVG icons (e.g., from Font Awesome) or recreate with `<path>` elements.\n\n\n## **7. Credits & Logos (Bottom Section)**\nPositioned at the bottom of the image (`y=470px` to `y=500px`), the credits include source information and partner branding.  \n\n### **Left: Source Text & Icons**\n- **Icons**:  \n  - Creative Commons (CC): `10px × 10px` (white on black background).  \n  - Link: `10px × 10px` (gray).  \n  - Equals Sign: `10px × 10px` (gray).  \n- **Text**:  \n  - `@StatistaCharts` (8pt, gray).  \n  - `Source: BBC` (8pt, gray).  \n- **Layout**: Icons + text are left-aligned (`x=50px`), spaced 5px apart.  \n\n### **Right: Brand Logos**\nThree logos are aligned horizontally, spaced 10px apart (`x=500px` to `x=750px`):  \n- **indy100**: Red (`#E3120B`), bold sans-serif (14pt), most prominent.  \n- **The Independent**: Black, serif (12pt) (e.g., Times New Roman).  \n- **Statista**: Blue (`#0071CE`), sans-serif (12pt) with a `12px × 12px` square icon (blue) to the right.  \n\n\n## **8. Critical SVG Coding Rules**\nTo ensure scalability and accuracy, follow these rules for SVG elements:  \n\n### **Text Elements**\n- Use **web-safe fonts** (e.g., `Arial`, `Helvetica`) for consistency.  \n- Align text to the grid (e.g., title centered at `y=30px`).  \n- Use `<text>` elements with `font-size`, `font-family`, and `fill` attributes.  \n\n### **Lines & Circles**\n- **Y-Axis**: A vertical line from `(50px, 50px)` to `(50px, 450px)` (2px stroke, black).  \n- **X-Axis**: A horizontal line from `(50px, 450px)` to `(750px, 450px)` (2px stroke, black).  \n- **Grid Lines**: Horizontal lines at each y-tick (e.g., `y=50px`, `y=90px`, ..., `y=450px`), spanning from `x=50px` to `x=750px` (1px stroke, `#E0E0E0`).  \n- **Data Points**: `<circle>` elements with `cx`, `cy`, `r=3px` (6px diameter), and `fill` matching the sport color.  \n- **Lines**: `<path>` elements connecting data points (e.g., for Cycling: `M160 450 L300 410 L440 370 L580 50 L720 50 L760 170`).  \n\n### **Flags**\nRecreate flags using `<rect>` and `<path>` elements (avoid `<image>` for scalability):  \n- **USA Flag**: Red and white stripes (12px width × 8px height) with a blue field (4px × 4px) and white stars.  \n- **Australia Flag**: Blue field with a Union Jack (top-left) and seven white stars.  \n- **Greece Flag**: Blue and white horizontal stripes (9 stripes) with a white cross (top-left).  \n\n### **Logos**\n- **indy100**: Use `<text>` with `font-weight=\"bold\"` and `fill=\"#E3120B\"`.  \n- **The Independent**: Use a serif font (e.g., `Times New Roman`) with `fill=\"#000000\"`.  \n- **Statista**: Combine `<text>` (blue) with a `<rect>` (blue square) to the right.  \n\n\n## **9. Example SVG Snippet (Critical Elements)**\nBelow is a simplified SVG snippet for the **Cycling line** and **1996 data point** to illustrate the structure:  \n```svg\n<svg width=\"800\" height=\"500\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <!-- Y-Axis -->\n  <line x1=\"50\" y1=\"50\" x2=\"50\" y2=\"450\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n  \n  <!-- X-Axis -->\n  <line x1=\"50\" y1=\"450\" x2=\"750\" y2=\"450\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-width=\"2\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Grid Lines (y=50px to y=450px, 40px intervals) -->\n  <line x1=\"50\" y1=\"50\" x2=\"750\" y2=\"50\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <line x1=\"50\" y1=\"90\" x2=\"750\" y2=\"90\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <!-- Repeat for y=130, 170, ..., 450 -->\n  \n  <!-- Cycling Line (Orange: #F37021) -->\n  <path d=\"M160 450 L300 410 L440 370 L580 50 L720 50 L760 170\" stroke=\"#F37021\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Cycling Data Points (Orange Circles) -->\n  <circle cx=\"160\" cy=\"450\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#F37021\"/> <!-- 1996: 0 medals -->\n  <circle cx=\"300\" cy=\"410\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#F37021\"/> <!-- 2000: 1 medal -->\n  <circle cx=\"440\" cy=\"370\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#F37021\"/> <!-- 2004: 2 medals -->\n  <circle cx=\"580\" cy=\"50\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#F37021\"/>   <!-- 2008: 8 medals -->\n  <circle cx=\"720\" cy=\"50\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#F37021\"/>   <!-- 2012: 8 medals -->\n  <circle cx=\"760\" cy=\"170\" r=\"3\" fill=\"#F37021\"/>  <!-- 2016: 6 medals -->\n  \n  <!-- Cycling Icon (Bicycle) -->\n  <path d=\"M770 170 ...\" stroke=\"#999999\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\"/> <!-- Replace with actual bicycle path -->\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n## **10. Final Checks for SVG Accuracy**\nBefore finalizing the SVG, verify:  \n- **Data Points**: Exact alignment with x-ticks (years) and y-values (medals).  \n- **Colors**: Hex codes match the legend and branding.  \n- **Icons**: Scalable (no raster images) and positioned correctly.  \n- **Text**: Font sizes, families, and alignment are consistent.  \n- **Grid Lines**: Perfectly aligned with y-ticks.  \n- **Olympic Rings**: Correct interlocking and dimensions.  \n\nBy following this guide, the SVG will be **pixel-perfect** and **scalable**, ensuring the image retains its clarity at any size.",
  "v1_58": "To recreate this image as an accurate SVG, the following detailed description covers all geometric, visual, and structural elements, including precise coordinates, colors, and layout rules.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of a **centered data table** with a title and horizontal divider above it. Key elements include:  \n- **Title**: \"Dataset 1\" (centered at the top).  \n- **Horizontal Divider**: A thin light-blue line below the title.  \n- **Table**: A 3-column, 11-row grid (1 header row + 10 data rows) with a black border.  \n  - **Header Cells**: 3 columns with colored backgrounds:  \n    - Column 1: \"Department\" (yellow).  \n    - Column 2: \"Name\" (green).  \n    - Column 3: \"Salary\" (light blue).  \n  - **Data Cells**: 10 rows of employee data (department, name, salary) with white backgrounds.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **flat, solid colors** (no gradients or textures). Exact hex codes are specified for consistency:  \n\n| Element                | Color (Hex)       | Description                                  |\n|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Title (\"Dataset 1\")    | `#000000` (black) | Bold, sans-serif.                            |\n| Horizontal Divider     | `#ADD8E6` (light blue) | 2px height, full table width.                |\n| Table Borders          | `#000000` (black) | 1px solid border around the table and cells. |\n| \"Department\" Header    | `#FFD700` (gold)  | Bold text on yellow background.              |\n| \"Name\" Header          | `#90EE90` (light green) | Bold text on green background.           |\n| \"Salary\" Header        | `#ADD8E6` (light blue) | Bold text on blue background.            |\n| Data Cells             | `#FFFFFF` (white) | Regular text on white background.            |\n| Text (all)             | `#000000` (black) | Sans-serif font (e.g., Arial).               |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **centered** and **grid-aligned** for clarity. Below is a coordinate system (assuming an SVG viewport of `width=\"600\"` and `height=\"540\"` to accommodate all elements):  \n\n| Element                | Position (X/Y)       | Dimensions       | Alignment/Rules                              |\n|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Title (\"Dataset 1\")** | `x=\"300\" y=\"40\"`     | `font-size=\"24\"` | Centered (`text-anchor=\"middle\"`), bold.     |\n| **Horizontal Divider** | `x=\"0\" y=\"50\"`       | `width=\"600\" height=\"2\"` | Full table width, 10px below the title.      |\n| **Table Container**    | `x=\"0\" y=\"80\"`       | `width=\"600\" height=\"440\"` | Centered, 1px black border.                  |\n| **Columns**            | Equal width         | `200px` each     | Column 1: 0–200px; Column 2: 200–400px; Column 3: 400–600px. |\n| **Rows**               | Equal height        | `40px` each      | 11 rows total (1 header + 10 data).          |\n| **Header Cells**       | Row 1 (y=80–120)    | `200px × 40px`   | Background colors applied to column 1–3.     |\n| **Data Rows**          | Rows 2–11 (y=120–520) | `200px × 40px` per cell | 10 rows of employee data.                    |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe design is **minimalist and functional**, typical of data tables. Key style rules:  \n- **Flat Design**: No shadows, gradients, or 3D effects.  \n- **Consistent Borders**: 1px black borders around all cells and the table.  \n- **Font Consistency**:  \n  - Title: Bold, 24px sans-serif (e.g., Arial).  \n  - Headers: Bold, 16px sans-serif.  \n  - Data: Regular, 16px sans-serif.  \n- **Alignment**:  \n  - Title: Centered.  \n  - Headers: Left-aligned with 10px padding.  \n  - Data:  \n    - **Department/Name**: Left-aligned with 10px padding.  \n    - **Salary**: Right-aligned with 10px padding (using `text-anchor=\"end\"`).  \n\n\n### **5.

  "v1_60": "To accurately recreate the image as an SVG, here’s a detailed, structured description covering all required aspects—including geometric precision, styling, and data formatting:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **7-row × 5-column table** with a grid layout. Key elements include:\n- **Header Row**: Topmost row with blue background and white bold text.\n- **Data Rows**: 5 rows (USA, China, Australia, India, South Korea) with white backgrounds and black text.\n- **Total Row**: Bottom row (blue background, white bold text) summarizing totals/averages.\n- **Cells**: Rectangular cells with thin borders, each containing text (labels or numbers).\n- **Columns**: \n  1. **Country** (text labels: left-aligned).\n  2. **Sales Volume** (numeric values: right-aligned).\n  3. **Revenue** (currency values: right-aligned).\n  4. **Profit** (currency values: right-aligned).\n  5. **Profit Margin** (percentage values: right-aligned).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Colors**\n| Element                | Background Color | Text Color | Border Color |\n|------------------------|------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Header Row Cells       | #0071CE (dark blue) | #FFFFFF (white) | #E0E0E0 (light gray) |\n| Data Row Cells         | #FFFFFF (white)  | #000000 (black) | #E0E0E0 (light gray) |\n| Total Row Cells        | #0071CE (dark blue) | #FFFFFF (white) | #E0E0E0 (light gray) |\n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Flat Design**: No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects—consistent with modern minimalist style.\n- **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial/Helvetica) for readability. Header/total text is **bold**; data text is regular.\n\n#### **Borders**\n- **Thickness**: 1px solid #E0E0E0 (light gray) around all cells and the entire table.\n- **Visibility**: Subtle to avoid cluttering the grid while defining cell boundaries.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe table uses a **consistent grid** with fixed row heights and column widths. Below is a breakdown of dimensions (assumes a 800px-wide table for scalability; adjust proportions as needed):\n\n#### **Row Heights**\n- All rows (header, data, total) have the **same height** (e.g., 40px for a 280px-tall table: 7 rows × 40px = 280px).\n- **Row Order**: Header (top) → USA → China → Australia → India → South Korea → Total (bottom).\n\n#### **Column Widths**\nColumns are sized to accommodate content, with consistent widths per column:\n| Column             | Width (px) | Percentage of Table Width | Justification |\n|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Country            | 200        | 25%                       | Left-aligned (data cells); centered (header) |\n| Sales Volume       | 120        | 15%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n| Revenue            | 200        | 25%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n| Profit             | 200        | 25%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n| Profit Margin      | 80         | 10%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n\n#### **Cell Alignment**\n- **Header Cells**: Text is **centered** (e.g., \"Country\" is in the middle of its blue cell).\n- **Data Cells**: \n  - **Country Column**: Text left-aligned (e.g., \"USA\" starts at the left of its white cell).\n  - **Numeric Columns** (Sales Volume, Revenue, Profit, Profit Margin): Text **right-aligned** (numbers are easier to compare when aligned by their decimal points).\n- **Total Row**: \n  - \"Total / Avg\" (first column) is left-aligned.\n  - Numeric values (all columns) are right-aligned (matches data rows).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean lines, flat colors, and no decorative elements—focused on readability.\n- **Contrast**: High contrast between blue header/total rows and white data rows improves scannability.\n- **Consistency**: \n  - Same font (sans-serif) and font size (e.g., 14px) throughout.\n  - Uniform borders and padding (10px inside cells) to prevent text from touching edges.\n- **Professional Tone**: Suitable for business reports—uses standard currency/percentage formatting.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text and symbols are critical for accuracy. Below is a breakdown of **every cell’s content** (including formatting rules):\n\n#### **Header Row (Bold White Text, Centered)**\n| Column 1       | Column 2         | Column 3    | Column 4   | Column 5          |\n|----------------|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Country**    | **Sales Volume** | **Revenue** | **Profit** | **Profit Margin** |\n\n#### **Data Rows (Black Regular Text)**\n| Country       | Sales Volume (Right-Aligned) | Revenue (Right-Aligned) | Profit (Right-Aligned) | Profit Margin (Right-Aligned) |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| USA           | 40.080                        | $15.971.880             | $3.086.421             | 19,3%                         |\n| China         | 35.070                        | $15.866.670             | $3.032.162             | 19,1%                         |\n| Australia     | 27.054                        | $14.812.566             | $2.868.636             | 19,4%                         |\n| India         | 23.046                        | $10.608.174             | $1.853.710             | 17,5%                         |\n| South Korea   | 16.032                        | $10.494.948             | $1.975.844             | 18,8%                         |\n\n#### **Total Row (Bold White Text)**\n| Column 1         | Column 2 (Total) | Column 3 (Total) | Column 4 (Total) | Column 5 (Average) |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Total / Avg**  | 141.282          | $67.754.238      | $12.816.772      | 18,8%              |\n\n#### **Key Formatting Rules**\n- **Thousands Separator**: Dots (.) (e.g., 40.080 = 40,080).\n- **Decimal Separator**: Commas (,) (e.g., 19,3% = 19.3%).\n- **Currency**: $ symbol **before** the number (e.g., $15.971.880).\n- **Percentage**: % symbol **after** the number (e.g., 19,3%).\n- **Alignment**: Numeric values (all columns except Country) are **right-aligned** for consistency.\n\n\n### **6. Geometric Details for SVG**\nTo recreate the table accurately in SVG, use **<rect>** for cells and **<text>** for content. Below is a template with coordinates (based on an 800px-wide × 280px-tall table):\n\n#### **Row Heights**\n- Each row is 40px tall (7 rows × 40px = 280px).\n- **Y-Coordinates**: \n  - Header: y=0 to y=40.\n  - USA: y=40 to y=80.\n  - China: y=80 to y=120.\n  - Australia: y=120 to y=160.\n  - India: y=160 to y=200.\n  - South Korea: y=200 to y=240.\n  - Total: y=240 to y=280.\n\n#### **Column Widths**\n- **X-Coordinates**: \n  - Country: x=0 to x=200 (200px wide).\n  - Sales Volume: x=200 to x=320 (120px wide).\n  - Revenue: x=320 to x=520 (200px wide).\n  - Profit: x=520 to x=720 (200px wide).\n  - Profit Margin: x=720 to x=800 (80px wide).\n\n#### **Cell Padding**\nAdd **10px padding** inside all cells to prevent text from touching borders:\n- **Country Column**: Text starts at x=10 (left padding).\n- **Numeric Columns**: Text ends at x=(column width - 10) (right padding). For example, Sales Volume text ends at x=310 (320 - 10).\n\n#### **Example SVG Code Snippet**\n```svg\n<svg width=\"800\" height=\"280\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" font-family=\"Arial\">\n  <!-- Table Border -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"280\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Header Row (y=0 to y=40) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"100\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Country</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"260\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Sales Volume</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"420\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Revenue</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"520\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"620\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Profit</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"720\" y=\"0\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"760\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Profit Margin</text>\n  \n  <!-- Data Row: USA (y=40 to y=80) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"40\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"start\">USA</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"40\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"310\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">40.080</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"40\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"510\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">$15.971.880</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"520\" y=\"40\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"710\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">$3.086.421</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"720\" y=\"40\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"790\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">19,3%</text>\n  \n  <!-- Repeat Data Rows for China, Australia, India, South Korea (adjust y-coordinate by 40px per row) -->\n  \n  <!-- Total Row (y=240 to y=280) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"240\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"start\">Total / Avg</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"240\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"310\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">141.282</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"240\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"510\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">$67.754.238</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"520\" y=\"240\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"710\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">$12.816.772</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"720\" y=\"240\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"790\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">18,8%</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **7. Critical Notes for SVG Accuracy**\n- **Alignment**: Numeric values (all columns except Country) must be **right-aligned** to match the image.\n- **Separators**: Use **dots (.) for thousands** and **commas (,) for decimals** (e.g., 40.080 = 40,080; 19,3% = 19.3%).\n- **Symbols**: Include $ (before revenue/profit) and % (after profit margin) as shown.\n- **Borders**: Ensure 1px light gray (#E0E0E0) borders around all cells and the table perimeter.\n- **Font**: Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial) with consistent size (14px recommended) for readability.\n\nThis description provides all the geometric, stylistic, and data-specific details needed to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. Adjust dimensions (width/height) as needed—all proportions (column widths, row heights) are maintained in the template.",
  "v1_61": "To accurately recreate the image as an SVG, here’s a detailed, structured description covering all required aspects—including geometric precision, styling, and data formatting:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **7-row × 5-column table** with a grid layout. Key elements include:\n- **Header Row**: Topmost row with blue background and white bold text.\n- **Data Rows**: 5 rows (USA, China, Australia, India, South Korea) with white backgrounds and black text.\n- **Total Row**: Bottom row (blue background, white bold text) summarizing totals/averages.\n- **Cells**: Rectangular cells with thin borders, each containing text (labels or numbers).\n- **Columns**: \n  1. **Country** (text labels: left-aligned).\n  2. **Sales Volume** (numeric values: right-aligned).\n  3. **Revenue** (currency values: right-aligned).\n  4. **Profit** (currency values: right-aligned).\n  5. **Profit Margin** (percentage values: right-aligned).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Colors**\n| Element                | Background Color | Text Color | Border Color |\n|------------------------|------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Header Row Cells       | #0071CE (dark blue) | #FFFFFF (white) | #E0E0E0 (light gray) |\n| Data Row Cells         | #FFFFFF (white)  | #000000 (black) | #E0E0E0 (light gray) |\n| Total Row Cells        | #0071CE (dark blue) | #FFFFFF (white) | #E0E0E0 (light gray) |\n\n#### **Textures**\n- **Flat Design**: No gradients, shadows, or 3D effects—consistent with modern minimalist style.\n- **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial/Helvetica) for readability. Header/total text is **bold**; data text is regular.\n\n#### **Borders**\n- **Thickness**: 1px solid #E0E0E0 (light gray) around all cells and the entire table.\n- **Visibility**: Subtle to avoid cluttering the grid while defining cell boundaries.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe table uses a **consistent grid** with fixed row heights and column widths. Below is a breakdown of dimensions (assumes a 800px-wide table for scalability; adjust proportions as needed):\n\n#### **Row Heights**\n- All rows (header, data, total) have the **same height** (e.g., 40px for a 280px-tall table: 7 rows × 40px = 280px).\n- **Row Order**: Header (top) → USA → China → Australia → India → South Korea → Total (bottom).\n\n#### **Column Widths**\nColumns are sized to accommodate content, with consistent widths per column:\n| Column             | Width (px) | Percentage of Table Width | Justification |\n|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| Country            | 200        | 25%                       | Left-aligned (data cells); centered (header) |\n| Sales Volume       | 120        | 15%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n| Revenue            | 200        | 25%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n| Profit             | 200        | 25%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n| Profit Margin      | 80         | 10%                       | Right-aligned (all cells) |\n\n#### **Cell Alignment**\n- **Header Cells**: Text is **centered** (e.g., \"Country\" is in the middle of its blue cell).\n- **Data Cells**: \n  - **Country Column**: Text left-aligned (e.g., \"USA\" starts at the left of its white cell).\n  - **Numeric Columns** (Sales Volume, Revenue, Profit, Profit Margin): Text **right-aligned** (numbers are easier to compare when aligned by their decimal points).\n- **Total Row**: \n  - \"Total / Avg\" (first column) is left-aligned.\n  - Numeric values (all columns) are right-aligned (matches data rows).\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean lines, flat colors, and no decorative elements—focused on readability.\n- **Contrast**: High contrast between blue header/total rows and white data rows improves scannability.\n- **Consistency**: \n  - Same font (sans-serif) and font size (e.g., 14px) throughout.\n  - Uniform borders and padding (10px inside cells) to prevent text from touching edges.\n- **Professional Tone**: Suitable for business reports—uses standard currency/percentage formatting.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text and symbols are critical for accuracy. Below is a breakdown of **every cell’s content** (including formatting rules):\n\n#### **Header Row (Bold White Text, Centered)**\n| Column 1       | Column 2         | Column 3    | Column 4   | Column 5          |\n|----------------|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|\n| **Country**    | **Sales Volume** | **Revenue** | **Profit** | **Profit Margin** |\n\n#### **Data Rows (Black Regular Text)**\n| Country       | Sales Volume (Right-Aligned) | Revenue (Right-Aligned) | Profit (Right-Aligned) | Profit Margin (Right-Aligned) |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| USA           | 40.080                        | $15.971.880             | $3.086.421             | 19,3%                         |\n| China         | 35.070                        | $15.866.670             | $3.032.162             | 19,1%                         |\n| Australia     | 27.054                        | $14.812.566             | $2.868.636             | 19,4%                         |\n| India         | 23.046                        | $10.608.174             | $1.853.710             | 17,5%                         |\n| South Korea   | 16.032                        | $10.494.948             | $1.975.844             | 18,8%                         |\n\n#### **Total Row (Bold White Text)**\n| Column 1         | Column 2 (Total) | Column 3 (Total) | Column 4 (Total) | Column 5 (Average) |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **Total / Avg**  | 141.282          | $67.754.238      | $12.816.772      | 18,8%              |\n\n#### **Key Formatting Rules**\n- **Thousands Separator**: Dots (.) (e.g., 40.080 = 40,080).\n- **Decimal Separator**: Commas (,) (e.g., 19,3% = 19.3%).\n- **Currency**: $ symbol **before** the number (e.g., $15.971.880).\n- **Percentage**: % symbol **after** the number (e.g., 19,3%).\n- **Alignment**: Numeric values (all columns except Country) are **right-aligned** for consistency.\n\n\n### **6. Geometric Details for SVG**\nTo recreate the table accurately in SVG, use **<rect>** for cells and **<text>** for content. Below is a template with coordinates (based on an 800px-wide × 280px-tall table):\n\n#### **Row Heights**\n- Each row is 40px tall (7 rows × 40px = 280px).\n- **Y-Coordinates**: \n  - Header: y=0 to y=40.\n  - USA: y=40 to y=80.\n  - China: y=80 to y=120.\n  - Australia: y=120 to y=160.\n  - India: y=160 to y=200.\n  - South Korea: y=200 to y=240.\n  - Total: y=240 to y=280.\n\n#### **Column Widths**\n- **X-Coordinates**: \n  - Country: x=0 to x=200 (200px wide).\n  - Sales Volume: x=200 to x=320 (120px wide).\n  - Revenue: x=320 to x=520 (200px wide).\n  - Profit: x=520 to x=720 (200px wide).\n  - Profit Margin: x=720 to x=800 (80px wide).\n\n#### **Cell Padding**\nAdd **10px padding** inside all cells to prevent text from touching borders:\n- **Country Column**: Text starts at x=10 (left padding).\n- **Numeric Columns**: Text ends at x=(column width - 10) (right padding). For example, Sales Volume text ends at x=310 (320 - 10).\n\n#### **Example SVG Code Snippet**\n```svg\n<svg width=\"800\" height=\"280\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" font-family=\"Arial\">\n  <!-- Table Border -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"280\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  \n  <!-- Header Row (y=0 to y=40) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"100\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Country</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"0\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"260\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Sales Volume</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"420\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Revenue</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"520\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"620\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Profit</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"720\" y=\"0\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"760\" y=\"20\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\">Profit Margin</text>\n  \n  <!-- Data Row: USA (y=40 to y=80) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"40\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"start\">USA</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"40\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"310\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">40.080</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"40\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"510\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">$15.971.880</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"520\" y=\"40\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"710\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">$3.086.421</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"720\" y=\"40\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"790\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"14\" fill=\"#000000\" text-anchor=\"end\">19,3%</text>\n  \n  <!-- Repeat Data Rows for China, Australia, India, South Korea (adjust y-coordinate by 40px per row) -->\n  \n  <!-- Total Row (y=240 to y=280) -->\n  <rect x=\"0\" y=\"240\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"start\">Total / Avg</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"200\" y=\"240\" width=\"120\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"310\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">141.282</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"320\" y=\"240\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"510\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">$67.754.238</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"520\" y=\"240\" width=\"200\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"710\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">$12.816.772</text>\n  \n  <rect x=\"720\" y=\"240\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#0071CE\" stroke=\"#E0E0E0\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n  <text x=\"790\" y=\"260\" font-size=\"14\" font-weight=\"bold\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">18,8%</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **7.

  "v1_62": "To accurately recreate the image as an SVG, we need a **detailed, structured description** of the table’s layout, colors, text, and style. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of all elements, optimized for precision in vector graphics.\n\n\n## 1.

SVG-Specific Notes for Recreation\nTo recreate the table in SVG, use **`<rect>` elements for cells** and **`<text>` elements for content**. Below are critical considerations:\n\n### 1. Table Border\nDraw a 1px solid `#BDC3C7` rectangle around the entire table:\n```svg\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"280\" fill=\"white\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n```\n\n### 2. Cell Borders\nDraw 1px solid `#BDC3C7` rectangles for each cell. For example, the header cell for `JAN` (Row 1, Column 2):\n```svg\n<rect x=\"160\" y=\"0\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#27AE60\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n```\n\n### 3. Text Positioning\n- **Centered Text (Headers)**: Calculate the x-coordinate as `cell.x + cell.width/2 - text.width/2`.\n- **Left-Aligned Text (Labels)**: Use `cell.x + padding.left` (e.g., `0 + 8 = 8` for Column 1).\n- **Right-Aligned Text (Numbers)**: Calculate the x-coordinate as `cell.x + cell.width - padding.right - text.width` (e.g., `160 + 80 - 8 - text.width` for Column 2).\n\n### 4. Text Measurement\nTo ensure proper alignment, measure the width of each text element using a tool like `getBBox()` in SVG. For example, the text `$5,000` in Column 2 (Row 3) will have a width of approximately `50px` (depending on the font), so the x-coordinate would be `160 + 80 - 8 - 50 = 182px`.\n\n### 5. Example SVG Markup (Row 1, Column 2)\n```svg\n<!-- Cell for \"JAN\" (Row 1, Column 2) -->\n<rect x=\"160\" y=\"0\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#27AE60\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n<!-- Text for \"JAN\" (centered) -->\n<text \n  x=\"200\" <!-- 160 + 80/2 - 15 (text width)/2 = 200 -->\n  y=\"24\" <!-- 0 + 40/2 + 4 (vertical alignment) = 24 -->\n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"14\" \n  font-weight=\"bold\" \n  fill=\"white\" \n  text-anchor=\"middle\"\n>JAN</text>\n```\n\n### 6. Example SVG Markup (Row 3, Column 2)\n```svg\n<!-- Cell for \"$5,000\" (Row 3, Column 2) -->\n<rect x=\"160\" y=\"75\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" fill=\"white\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n<!-- Text for \"$5,000\" (right-aligned) -->\n<text \n  x=\"232\" <!-- 160 + 80 - 8 - 50 (text width) = 232 -->\n  y=\"94\" <!-- 75 + 30/2 + 4 (vertical alignment) = 94 -->\n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12\" \n  fill=\"black\" \n  text-anchor=\"end\"\n>$5,000</text>\n```\n\n\n## 7. Key Takeaways for Accurate Recreation\n- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform column widths, row heights, padding, and borders.\n- **Alignment**: Strictly follow text alignment rules (left for labels, right for numbers).\n- **Colors**: Use the exact hex codes specified (or match the image’s color palette).\n- **Text Precision**: Include all symbols (`$`, commas) and exact values (e.g., `$3,833` not `$3,833.33`).\n- **Hierarchy**: Emphasize headers, categories, and totals using color, font weight, and row height as described.\n\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the structure, style, and content of the original table. The key to success is **precision**—every cell, text element, and color must match the description exactly.",

SVG-Specific Notes for Recreation\nTo recreate the table in SVG, use **`<rect>` elements for cells** and **`<text>` elements for content**. Below are critical considerations:\n\n### 1. Table Border\nDraw a 1px solid `#BDC3C7` rectangle around the entire table:\n```svg\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"280\" fill=\"white\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n```\n\n### 2. Cell Borders\nDraw 1px solid `#BDC3C7` rectangles for each cell. For example, the header cell for `JAN` (Row 1, Column 2):\n```svg\n<rect x=\"160\" y=\"0\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#27AE60\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n```\n\n### 3. Text Positioning\n- **Centered Text (Headers)**: Calculate the x-coordinate as `cell.x + cell.width/2 - text.width/2`.\n- **Left-Aligned Text (Labels)**: Use `cell.x + padding.left` (e.g., `0 + 8 = 8` for Column 1).\n- **Right-Aligned Text (Numbers)**: Calculate the x-coordinate as `cell.x + cell.width - padding.right - text.width` (e.g., `160 + 80 - 8 - text.width` for Column 2).\n\n### 4. Text Measurement\nTo ensure proper alignment, measure the width of each text element using a tool like `getBBox()` in SVG. For example, the text `$5,000` in Column 2 (Row 3) will have a width of approximately `50px` (depending on the font), so the x-coordinate would be `160 + 80 - 8 - 50 = 182px`.\n\n### 5. Example SVG Markup (Row 1, Column 2)\n```svg\n<!-- Cell for \"JAN\" (Row 1, Column 2) -->\n<rect x=\"160\" y=\"0\" width=\"80\" height=\"40\" fill=\"#27AE60\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n<!-- Text for \"JAN\" (centered) -->\n<text \n  x=\"200\" <!-- 160 + 80/2 - 15 (text width)/2 = 200 -->\n  y=\"24\" <!-- 0 + 40/2 + 4 (vertical alignment) = 24 -->\n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"14\" \n  font-weight=\"bold\" \n  fill=\"white\" \n  text-anchor=\"middle\"\n>JAN</text>\n```\n\n### 6. Example SVG Markup (Row 3, Column 2)\n```svg\n<!-- Cell for \"$5,000\" (Row 3, Column 2) -->\n<rect x=\"160\" y=\"75\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" fill=\"white\" stroke=\"#BDC3C7\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>\n\n<!-- Text for \"$5,000\" (right-aligned) -->\n<text \n  x=\"232\" <!-- 160 + 80 - 8 - 50 (text width) = 232 -->\n  y=\"94\" <!-- 75 + 30/2 + 4 (vertical alignment) = 94 -->\n  font-family=\"Arial\" \n  font-size=\"12\" \n  fill=\"black\" \n  text-anchor=\"end\"\n>$5,000</text>\n```\n\n\n## 7. Key Takeaways for Accurate Recreation\n- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform column widths, row heights, padding, and borders.\n- **Alignment**: Strictly follow text alignment rules (left for labels, right for numbers).\n- **Colors**: Use the exact hex codes specified (or match the image’s color palette).\n- **Text Precision**: Include all symbols (`$`, commas) and exact values (e.g., `$3,833` not `$3,833.33`).\n- **Hierarchy**: Emphasize headers, categories, and totals using color, font weight, and row height as described.\n\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the structure, style, and content of the original table. The key to success is **precision**—every cell, text element, and color must match the description exactly.",
  "v1_64": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed breakdown of its components, organized by the requested focus areas. The image is a **side-by-side composite of two head-and-shoulders photographs** (50% width each, equal height), with distinct backgrounds, subjects, and styling.\n\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image is split vertically into two equal-width panels (left/right), each containing a **human subject** (centered, facing forward) and a **background** with partial text/designs. Key objects per panel:\n\n#### Left Panel\n- **Subject**: A person with long, wavy hair (shoulder to mid-back length) wearing a **yellow dress** and a **silver necklace**.\n  - **Dress**: High neck, short puff sleeves (ending at the bicep), pleated bodice (vertical pleats from neck to waist), and a flowy, A-line skirt (cropped at the waist).\n  - **Necklace**: Thin chain (~1mm width) with a small cross pendant (equal-length arms, ~5mm tall) and a tiny loop at the top for the chain.\n- **Background**: Solid dark gray/black rectangle with partial white serif text:  \n  - Top left: \"THE CINEMA\" (truncated, \"THE\" fully visible, \"CINEMA\" cut off at \"MA\" below).  \n  - Center-left: \"MA\" (truncated, likely part of \"CINEMA\").\n\n#### Right Panel\n- **Subject**: A person with shoulder-length, layered wavy hair (slightly shorter than the left subject) wearing a **white floral dress**.\n  - **Dress**: Round neck, short puff sleeves (ending at the bicep), fitted bodice, and a straight skirt (cropped at the waist). The fabric features a **scattered floral pattern** (see *Colors/Textures* for details).\n- **Background**: Light gray/white rectangle with a faint architectural design (subtle columns and a frieze, suggesting a building facade) and partial indistinct serif text (similar to the left panel but less legible).\n\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n#### Left Panel\n- **Background**: Near-black (RGB ~#101010) with white text.  \n- **Dress**: Muted pale yellow (RGB ~#F0E68C), sheer/chiffon-like fabric with **vertical pleats** (visible as fine, evenly spaced lines on the bodice). The skirt is flowy, with a soft, non-pleated texture.  \n- **Hair**: Medium brown (RGB ~#8B4513) with subtle warm highlights, loose waves (voluminous, with larger curls than the right subject).  \n- **Necklace**: Bright silver (RGB ~#C0C0C0), metallic sheen.  \n- **Skin/Lips**: Warm fair skin (RGB ~#F8D7DA), bright pink lipstick (RGB ~#FF69B4), natural blush.  \n\n#### Right Panel\n- **Background**: Pale gray (RGB ~#E0E0E0) with a faint gray architectural pattern (RGB ~#C0C0C0).  \n- **Dress**: White base (RGB ~#FFFFFF) with a **floral print** featuring:  \n  - Large flowers: Bright pink (RGB ~#FF69B4) and red (RGB ~#FF0000) petals, green leaves (RGB ~#2E8B57).  \n  - Small flowers: Pale pink buds (RGB ~#FFB6C1), brown seed pods (RGB ~#8B4513).  \n  - The pattern is scattered (non-uniform, with clusters and single blooms) and printed on a smooth, non-sheer fabric.  \n- **Hair**: Medium brown (RGB ~#8B4513) with blonde balayage highlights (RGB ~#DAA520), layered waves (softer, shorter layers around the face).  \n- **Skin/Lips**: Warm fair skin (matching the left subject), natural pink lipstick (RGB ~#FFB6C1), minimal blush.  \n\n#### Shared Elements\n- **Eyes**: Brown (RGB ~#8B4513) with natural makeup (thin eyeliner, mascara).  \n- **Eyebrows**: Well-groomed, medium brown (matching hair color).  \n\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe image is a **1:2 width ratio** (each panel 50% of total width) with identical height (head-and-shoulders crop, waist-level bottom). Key alignments:  \n- **Subjects**: Centered in their respective panels, with eyes at the same horizontal level (midway up the image).  \n- **Necklines**: Left dress has a higher neck (closer to the chin) than the right dress (slightly lower, at the base of the neck).  \n- **Background Text/Designs**: Left panel’s \"THE CINEMA\" is at the **top-left corner** (truncated, \"THE\" fully visible, \"CINEMA\" cut off at \"MA\" below the subject’s hair). Right panel’s architectural pattern is at the **top-right corner** (faint columns and a frieze, partial text).  \n- **Negative Space**: Minimal—subjects occupy 80% of their panel’s height, with small gaps at the top (background text) and bottom (waist crop).  \n\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Overall Style**: Realistic, photographic composite (not illustrative). The left panel has a **formal/elegant vibe** (dark background, chiffon dress), while the right panel is **casual/daytime** (light background, floral dress).  \n- **Cropping**: Both subjects are cropped at the **waist**, with heads occupying 1/3 of the panel height (eyes at the \"rule of thirds\" horizontal line).  \n- **Contrast**: Strong left/right contrast (dark vs. light background, solid vs. patterned dress) creates visual balance.  \n- **Lighting**: Left panel has soft, cool lighting (highlights on the dress and necklace); right panel has warm, diffused lighting (highlights on the hair and dress).  \n\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n- **Left Panel Text**:  \n  - \"THE CINEMA\": Uppercase, serif font (e.g., Times New Roman), white, positioned at the **top-left corner** (truncated, \"THE\" fully visible, \"CINEMA\" cut off at the \"MA\" below the subject’s hair).  \n  - \"MA\": Uppercase, serif font, white, positioned **below the subject’s hair** (truncated, likely part of \"CINEMA\").  \n- **Right Panel Text/Design**:  \n  - Faint architectural pattern: **Columns** (vertical lines) and a **frieze** (horizontal decorative band) at the top-right corner, gray, low opacity.  \n  - Partial text: Indistinct serif font (likely \"THE\" or \"CINEMA\"), white, blended into the background.  \n- **Necklace**: Left subject’s necklace has a **cross pendant** with a small loop at the top (for the chain) and equal-length arms (1:1 ratio).  \n- **Dress Details**:  \n  - Left dress: Short puff sleeves (1/4 arm length, ending at the bicep), pleats on the bodice only (skirt is flowy).  \n  - Right dress: Slightly puffier shoulders (subtle volume) with straight short sleeves (ending at the bicep), fitted bodice (no pleats).  \n\n\n### Critical SVG Reproduction Notes\nTo ensure accuracy, prioritize these geometric and layout details:  \n- **Panel Divide**: A straight vertical line at 50% width (no gap between panels).  \n- **Dress Silhouettes**:  \n  - Left: High neck, short puff sleeves, pleated bodice (vertical lines), A-line skirt.  \n  - Right: Round neck, short puff sleeves, fitted bodice, straight skirt.  \n- **Floral Pattern**: Use **scattered, non-uniform placement** (large flowers ~10% of dress width, small flowers ~2% of dress width).  \n- **Hair Textures**: Left hair has **larger, looser waves** (curves with 5–10cm radius); right hair has **smaller, layered waves** (curves with 2–5cm radius).  \n- **Necklace**: Thin chain (1mm stroke) with a cross (5mm tall, 5mm wide) centered at the base of the neck.  \n- **Backgrounds**: Left is a solid dark rectangle with text; right is a solid light rectangle with a low-opacity architectural pattern.  \n\nFor SVG, use **layers** (background, subject, clothing, accessories) and **clipping paths** (to crop subjects at the waist). The floral pattern can be a **pattern swatch** with random placement, and pleats can be **repeating line patterns** on the left dress bodice.\n\n\nThis description includes all necessary details for precise SVG reproduction, from geometric shapes to color codes and texture indications. Let me know if you need further clarification on any element!",
  "v1_65": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into geometric, textural, and spatial components, with a focus on reproducible elements for vector art.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe central figure is a woman standing on a stage,占据 ~80% of the frame. Key objects include:  \n- **Oscar Statuette**: Held in her **left hand** (viewer’s right), the statuette is a stylized golden knight (humanoid form) standing on a rectangular black base. The figure has:  \n  - A rigid, upright posture with legs together.  \n  - Right arm raised to hold a **crusader’s sword** (diagonal, pointing upward).  \n  - Left hand resting on the hip.  \n  - A rounded \"helmet\" on the head, with a smooth, polished surface.  \n  - The base is a thick, rectangular block with a slightly tapered top, matte black with a golden rim where the statuette attaches.  \n- **Dress**: Sleeveless, floor-length, with two distinct layers:  \n  - **Sheer Upper Bodice**: A lightweight, semi-transparent mesh/tulle covering the neckline, shoulders, and upper torso (from collarbone to waist). The neckline is a **scoop shape** (curved, dipping to the center of the chest), with the mesh extending over the shoulders in thin, straps that merge at the back.  \n  - **Feathery Skirt**: A dense, voluminous layer of short (1–2 inch), stiff white feathers starting at the waist and falling to the floor. The feathers are arranged in a radial pattern, creating a rounded, A-line silhouette.  \n- **Microphone**: A black, cylindrical handheld mic positioned **centrally** in the lower third of the frame, between the woman and the camera. The mic head is a rounded capsule, with a thin stem leading to an unseen base.  \n- **Accessories**:  \n  - **Headband**: A thin (1–2 mm wide) silver band with evenly spaced small (1–2 mm) rhinestones, worn across the forehead (just above the eyebrows) to push back loose hair.  \n  - **Earrings**: Long (3–4 inch) chandelier-style drops with multiple small (1–2 mm) rhinestones in a linear, cascading pattern, worn on both ears.  \n  - **Ring**: A large (5–6 mm) diamond solitaire on the **right hand’s ring finger** (viewer’s left), with a thin platinum band.  \n  - **Nails**: White-painted, oval-shaped, with a slight French tip (pale pink base, white tip).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Oscar Statuette**:  \n  - **Body**: Bright, reflective gold (CMYK: 0, 20, 80, 0) with a high-gloss finish (simulate with gradient fills to capture light reflections).  \n  - **Base**: Matte black (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 100) with a thin golden rim (matching the statuette).  \n- **Dress**:  \n  - **Sheer Bodice**: Pale pinkish-white (CMYK: 0, 5, 5, 0) with 50–60% opacity (to show underlying skin tone).  \n  - **Feathery Skirt**: Pure white (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 0) with a **fuzzy, textured fill** (use small, overlapping ellipses or a pattern of short, curved lines to mimic feather texture).  \n- **Accessories**:  \n  - **Headband/Ring/Earrings**: Silver (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 20) with rhinestones (100% white, high gloss).  \n  - **Nails**: White (CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 0) with a pale pink base (CMYK: 0, 10, 5, 0) for the French tip.  \n- **Hair**: Dark brown (CMYK: 40, 60, 80, 20) with subtle highlights (CMYK: 30, 50, 70, 10) to show wave texture.  \n- **Background**: A gradient of warm browns:  \n  - **Central Stripes**: Two vertical, golden-yellow (CMYK: 0, 20, 60, 0) stripes on either side of the woman, forming a **V-shape** (wider at the top, narrowing to the center). The stripes have a soft, diffused edge (simulate with a radial gradient to mimic stage lighting).  \n  - **Outer Background**: Dark brown (CMYK: 60, 40, 40, 80) with a slight blur (bokeh effect) to draw focus to the figure.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe woman is the **focal point**, centered in the frame with a slight tilt to her right (viewer’s left). Key spatial arrangements:  \n- **Oscar Statuette**: Held in her left hand, the base rests against her right hip (viewer’s left hip). The statuette’s head reaches to the middle of her chest, with the sword pointing upward to the right.  \n- **Microphone**: Positioned **directly in front of her chest**, ~2 inches below the statuette’s base. The mic head is aligned with the center of her collarbone.  \n- **Hands**:  \n  - **Right Hand**: Raised to her neck, palm facing inward, fingers curved to touch her collarbone and throat. The ring is on the ring finger, with the diamond facing forward.  \n  - **Left Hand**: Grips the Oscar’s base, fingers wrapped around the stem (thumb on one side, fingers on the other).  \n- **Head**: Tilted slightly to her right (viewer’s left), with eyes half-closed and mouth open in a smile.  \n- **Hair**: Long, wavy, falling over her right shoulder (viewer’s left) in loose, cascading curls. The headband is positioned **1 inch above her eyebrows**, with hair tucked behind it on the sides.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism with Vector Simplification**: The SVG should prioritize clean lines and geometric shapes while retaining realistic details (e.g., feather texture, jewelry sparkle). Avoid photorealism; instead, use gradients and patterns to mimic texture.  \n- **Lighting**: Warm, directional lighting from the top-center (simulated by the golden background stripes) creates highlights on:  \n  - The Oscar’s face, sword, and base.  \n  - The dress’s feathery skirt (add a subtle white gradient to the top of the feathers to mimic light hitting the tips).  \n  - The woman’s collarbone, shoulders, and hair (subtle highlights in the hair to show volume).  \n- **Depth**: The background has a **shallow depth of field** (blur effect) to separate the figure from the backdrop. Use a radial gradient on the outer background (darker in the center, lighter at the edges) to mimic this.  \n- **Pose**: Dynamic and emotional—her body is slightly leaning forward, with a relaxed, joyful stance. The right hand’s position (touching her neck) conveys surprise or gratitude.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for Reproduction**\n- **Facial Features**:  \n  - **Eyes**: Half-closed, with a slight crinkle at the corners (simulate with curved lines).  \n  - **Mouth**: Open in a smile, with visible teeth (use small, rectangular shapes for teeth, curved lines for lips).  \n  - **Cheeks**: Subtle blush (pale pink, CMYK: 0, 10, 5, 0) to mimic emotion.  \n- **Nails**: The right hand’s nails are visible on the neck—paint them white with a French tip, and add a slight shine (10% white gradient) to the tips.  \n- **Earrings**: The left earring (viewer’s right) is partially hidden by hair; the right earring (viewer’s left) is fully visible, with 3–4 tiers of rhinestones.  \n- **Headband**: The rhinestones are evenly spaced (every 3–4 mm) along the silver band. Add a small reflection (white dot) to each rhinestone to mimic sparkle.  \n- **Dress Sheer Layer**: The mesh should be semi-transparent, allowing the outline of her torso to show through. Use a low-opacity fill (50–60%) with a subtle texture (e.g., fine cross-hatching) to mimic tulle.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout**\n- **Figure Dimensions**: The woman is ~6 feet tall (standard human proportion), with the Oscar statuette (13.5 inches tall) scaling to her hand size.  \n- **Frame Ratio**: The image is in a **vertical orientation** (16:9 or 3:4), with the woman’s head at the top third and the Oscar at the lower third.  \n- **Negative Space**: The golden background stripes frame her shoulders, creating a **V-shape** that draws focus to her face. The outer background is dark, with the stripes narrowing to the center to mimic stage spotlights.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Workflow**\n1. **Trace the Figure**: Use the Pen tool to outline the woman’s silhouette, dress layers, and accessories.  \n2. **Add Texture**: Use patterns (feathers), gradients (Oscar, hair), and low-opacity fills (sheer bodice) to mimic texture.  \n3. **Lighting**: Apply radial gradients to the background and linear gradients to the Oscar/dress to simulate highlights.  \n4. **Accessories**: Use small circles (rhinestones) and geometric shapes (ring, headband) with shine effects.  \n5. **Microphone**: A simple cylinder with a rounded top, positioned centrally to overlap the dress.  \n\nThis description provides the precision needed for an SVG that retains the image’s emotional tone and visual hierarchy while adhering to vector art constraints.",
  "v1_66": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, below is a **comprehensive, technical description** of its structure, elements, and visual properties. The image is a **2-row × 5-column grid of photographic portraits** with bold yellow borders, designed for a graphic, structured aesthetic.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe core structure is a **uniform grid** of **10 rectangular cells** (2 rows × 5 columns). Each cell contains a **headshot or upper-body portrait** of a person, clipped to the cell’s bounds. Key elements include:\n- **Grid Cells**: 10 identical rectangles with sharp corners, each containing a portrait.\n- **Borders**: A thick, solid yellow border surrounding every cell (consistent across all cells).\n- **Portraits**: Realistic photographic images of people, centered in each cell. Subjects are facing forward with neutral to slight smiles.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are defined with **hex codes** (approximate, based on visual analysis) for precision. Textures are described to guide SVG effects (e.g., glitter, sequins).\n\n#### **Grid Borders**\n- **Color**: Pure yellow (`#FFFF00`).  \n- **Thickness**: 3px (centered on the cell’s edge, so the border is included in the cell’s dimensions).  \n- **Style**: Solid, no gradient or texture.\n\n#### **Cell Dimensions & Proportions**\nAssumed total image size (common for 2×5 grids):  \n- **Total**: 1000px (width) × 400px (height).  \n- **Each Cell**: 200px (width) × 200px (height) **including the 3px border**.  \n- **Inner Portrait Area**: 194px (width) × 194px (height) (200px − 2×3px border).  \n\n#### **Portrait Details (Row-by-Row, Column-by-Column)**\nEach cell is labeled by **row (1 = top, 2 = bottom)** and **column (1 = left, 5 = right)**. Subjects are centered horizontally/vertically, with eyes at the cell’s midpoint (e.g., 100px from left/top for Row 1, Column 1).\n\n---\n\n##### **Row 1 (Top Row)**  \n**Column 1 (Top-Left Cell)**  \n- **Subject**: Woman with a voluminous brown updo (medium brown: `#8B4513`), light skin, and a slight smile.  \n- **Background**: Solid bright pink (`#FF66CC`).  \n- **Clothing**: Strapless nude top (`#F5DEB3`).  \n- **Layout**: Head occupies the upper 2/3 of the cell; shoulders align with the cell’s bottom edge.  \n\n**Column 2 (Top-Center-Left Cell)**  \n- **Subject**: Woman with long straight dark brown hair (`#2F1700`), medium-light skin, and a warm smile.  \n- **Background**: Solid neutral beige (`#F0E6D6`).  \n- **Clothing**: Black strapless top (`#000000`).  \n- **Layout**: Hair falls to mid-torso; head/upper torso centered.  \n\n**Column 3 (Top-Center Cell)**  \n- **Subject**: Man with short straight blonde hair (`#F0E68C`), light skin, and a smile.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe grid is **perfectly aligned** with no gaps between cells. Key positional rules:  \n- **Cell Placement**:  \n  - Row 1 (top row) cells: Y-coordinate = 0 (top of the image).  \n  - Row 2 (bottom row) cells: Y-coordinate = 200px (midpoint of the image).  \n  - Column 1 (leftmost) cells: X-coordinate = 0.  \n  - Column 2: X = 200px; Column 3: X = 400px; Column 4: X = 600px; Column 5: X = 800px.  \n- **Example Coordinates**:  \n  - Top-Left Cell (Row 1, Column 1): `x=0, y=0` to `x=200, y=200`.  \n  - Bottom-Right Cell (Row 2, Column 5): `x=800, y=200` to `x=1000, y=400`.  \n- **Subject Centering**:  \n  - Eyes are at the **geometric center** of each cell (e.g., Row 1 cells: `x=100px, y=100px`; Row 2 cells: `x=100px, y=300px`).  \n  - Shoulders/upper torso align with the bottom of the cell.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Genre**: Graphic collage (realistic photography + structured grid design).  \n- **Visual Hierarchy**: Bold yellow borders (`#FFFF00`) create a strong frame for each portrait, unifying the grid while drawing attention to individual subjects.  \n- **Consistency**:  \n  - Uniform cell size, border thickness, and subject centering.  \n  - All subjects face forward, creating a cohesive, engaging composition.  \n- **Diversity**: Varied background colors (solid), clothing styles (glitter, sequins, checkers), and hair textures (curly, straight, wavy) add visual interest without disrupting the grid’s harmony.  \n- **Realism vs. Graphic Design**: Photographic portraits (realistic textures: hair strands, fabric, skin) are balanced by the grid’s graphic simplicity (solid borders, flat backgrounds).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No Text**: The image contains no visible text or logos.  \n- **Key Symbols/Accents**:  \n  - **Row 1, Column 3**: White earbuds (wire descends into the jacket).  \n  - **Row 2, Column 1**: Silver microphone (held in the right hand; handle is black).  \n  - **Row 2, Column 4**: Large silver hoop earrings (symmetrical, framing the face) and a multi-strand silver necklace.  \n  - **Row 2, Column 5**: Black bow tie (perfectly centered on the white dress shirt).  \n- **Textures to Simulate in SVG**:  \n  - **Glitter (Row 2, Column 1)**: Small silver dots (`#C0C0C0`) scattered across the dark blue outfit.  \n  - **Sequins (Row 2, Column 2)**: Small red squares (`#FF0000`) with a metallic gradient (light red center, dark red edges).  \n  - **Checkers (Row 2, Column 4)**: 10px × 10px squares, alternating black (`#000000`) and white (`#FFFFFF`).  \n  - **Jewelry (All Cells)**: Metallic gradients (light silver center, dark silver edges) to simulate shine.  \n\n\n### **SVG Technical Notes**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these guidelines for SVG creation:  \n- **Cell Paths**: Use `<rect>` elements with `width=\"200\" height=\"200\"`, `stroke=\"#FFFF00\"`, `stroke-width=\"3\"`, and `fill` set to the cell’s background color.  \n- **Portraits**: Embed each portrait as an `<image>` element with `x=\"3\" y=\"3\" width=\"194\" height=\"194\"` (to fit within the 3px border).  \n- **Clipping**: Use a `<clipPath>` for each cell to ensure portraits are clipped to the inner 194px × 194px area.  \n- **Gradients/Textures**: Use `<linearGradient>` for metallic jewelry and `<circle>`/`<rect>` elements for glitter/sequins.  \n\nExample SVG snippet for the **Top-Left Cell (Row 1, Column 1)**:  \n```svg\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" stroke=\"#FFFF00\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"#FF66CC\"/>\n<image x=\"3\" y=\"3\" width=\"194\" height=\"194\" xlink:href=\"portrait1.jpg\" clip-path=\"url(#cell1-clip)\"/>\n<clipPath id=\"cell1-clip\">\n  <rect x=\"3\" y=\"3\" width=\"194\" height=\"194\"/>\n</clipPath>\n```\n\n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as an SVG, including **geometric precision**, **color codes**, **spatial relationships**, and **artistic style**. The grid’s uniformity and bold borders are the most critical elements to preserve, as they define the image’s graphic identity.",
  "v1_67": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into measurable, vector-friendly elements—focusing on **shapes, colors, text, spatial relationships, and branding**—to ensure precision for digital reconstruction.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image features three **gable-top cartons** of \"Better Than Milk\" dairy-free drinks, placed side-by-side on a **white wooden shelf**. Behind the cartons are partial views of two additional containers (a clear glass bottle and a white ceramic bottle). Key shapes include:\n\n### Cartons (Primary Focus)\nEach carton is a **rectangular prism** with a subtle 1-point perspective (slightly angled sides to indicate depth). Core components:\n- **Front Face**: A tall rectangle (main branding surface).\n- **Side Faces**: Narrow rectangles (left/right) angled at 10° to the front face.\n- **Top Face**: A small rectangle connecting the front and side faces.\n- **Cap**: A cylindrical screw cap (domed top + ridged body) centered on the top face.\n\n### Shelf\nA rectangular shelf with a **front lip** (10% of the shelf’s height) that extends forward to create a shadow. The shelf spans the full width of the image.\n\n### Background Containers\n- **Clear Glass Bottle**: Behind the left carton (partial view), with a white screw cap.\n- **White Ceramic Bottle**: Behind the right carton (partial view), with a narrow neck.\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\nThe design uses **flat colors** (no gradients) for a modern, commercial look. Textures are implied via subtle tint variations (e.g., carton sides are lighter than the front face to indicate depth).\n\n### Carton Color Palette (Left to Right)\n| Component               | Oat (Unsweetened) | Rice Hazelnut | Almond |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------|\n| **Front Face**          | Tan (#E6D3A3)     | Orange (#FFA500) | Teal (#008080) |\n| **Side Faces**          | Lighter Tan (#F0E6CC) | Lighter Orange (#FFD700) | Lighter Teal (#E0FFFF) |\n| **Cap**                 | White (#FFFFFF)   | White (#FFFFFF) | White (#FFFFFF) |\n| **Circle Logo**         | Cream (#FFF3CD)   | Light Orange (#FFE4B5) | Light Teal (#B0E0E6) |\n| **\"BETTER THAN MILK\"**  | Dark Brown (#5C3317) | Dark Orange (#CC5500) | Dark Teal (#004040) |\n\n### Shelf\n- **Top Surface**: White (#FFFFFF) with a subtle gray shadow (#D3D3D3) along the front lip.\n- **Lip**: White (#FFFFFF) with a darker gray shadow (#A9A9A9) underneath to indicate depth.\n\n### Background Containers\n- **Clear Glass Bottle**: Transparent (no fill, 1px gray stroke #C0C0C0) with a white cap (#FFFFFF).\n- **White Ceramic Bottle**: Off-white (#F5F5F5) with a 1px gray stroke (#D3D3D3) for definition.\n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties (Continued)\n### Key Shapes per Carton\n| Component               | Shape               | Dimensions (Relative to Carton Height) |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Front Face**          | Rectangle           | 100% tall × 35% wide                   |\n| **Side Face (Left/Right)** | Rectangle       | 100% tall × 8% wide (angled at 10°)    |\n| **Top Face**            | Rectangle           | 8% tall × 35% wide (connects front/side faces) |\n| **Cap**                 | Cylinder            | 12% tall × 15% diameter (centered on top face) |\n| **Circle Logo**         | Circle              | 30% diameter (centered horizontally, 15% from top) |\n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe three cartons are **adjacent** (no gap between them) and centered on the shelf. The shelf spans the full width of the image, with the cartons occupying ~80% of the shelf’s width.\n\n### Relative Sizing (Assume Shelf = 300px Wide)\n| Element                 | Width (px) | Height (px) | Position (X/Y) |\n|-------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Shelf**               | 300        | 50          | X: 0, Y: 250   |\n| **Each Carton**         | 80         | 100         | Left Carton: X=30, Y=150; Middle: X=110, Y=150; Right: X=190, Y=150 |\n| **Clear Glass Bottle**  | 10         | 20          | X=10, Y=140    |\n| **White Ceramic Bottle**| 12         | 25          | X=270, Y=135   |\n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe design follows a **flat, modern commercial style** with:\n- **Bold Branding**: The \"Better Than Milk\" logo (a circle with stacked text) is the most prominent element on each carton.\n- **Minimal Graphics**: Ingredient icons (oats, rice/hazelnut, almond) are stylized and simplified (no realistic textures).\n- **Sans-Serif Fonts**: All text uses clean, readable sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica) to align with retail branding.\n- **Subtle Perspective**: Carton sides are angled at 10° to create depth without overcomplicating the vector work.\n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\nAll text and symbols are critical for branding and must be reproduced exactly. Below is a breakdown of **text placement, fonts, and symbols** per carton:\n\n### Text Hierarchy (Per Carton)\n| Text Element           | Font Style         | Color       | Size (Relative to Carton Height) | Position |\n|------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|----------|\n| **\"BETTER THAN MILK\"** | Bold Sans-Serif    | See Carton Palette | \"BETTER\" = 10%, \"THAN\" = 8%, \"MILK\" = 12% | Centered in circle logo |\n| **\"organic\"**          | Light Sans-Serif   | Green (#008000) | 8% | 10% below circle logo (left-aligned) |\n| **Drink Type** (e.g., \"OAT DRINK\") | Bold Sans-Serif | Black (#000000) | 12% | 5% below \"organic\" (left-aligned) |\n| **\"dairy free\" / \"gluten free\"** | Regular Sans-Serif | Black (#000000) | 6% | 10% below drink type (two lines, left-aligned) |\n| **Volume** (e.g., \"35.8 FL OZ...\") | Regular Sans-Serif | Black (#000000) | 5% | Bottom center |\n\n### Carton-Specific Text\n| Carton               | Unique Text         | Position | Color       |\n|----------------------|---------------------|----------|-------------|\n| **Left (Oat)**       | \"unsweetened\"       | Top left | Black (#000000) |\n| **Middle (Rice)**    | \"hazelnut\"          | Below \"RICE DRINK\" | Brown (#8B4513) |\n\n### Symbols (Certification Logos)\nEach carton features three **centered, spaced logos** at the bottom (10% above the volume text). Use **SVG symbols** for reuse:\n| Logo                   | Shape       | Size (px) | Color Scheme |\n|------------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|\n| **USDA Organic**       | Circle      | 15×15     | Green (#008000) fill, white (#FFFFFF) shield/text |\n| **Non-GMO Project**    | Square      | 15×15     | Yellow (#FFD700) fill, black (#000000) butterfly/text |\n| **Vegan**              | Square      | 15×15     | Green (#008000) fill, white (#FFFFFF) \"V\" |\n\n### Ingredient Graphics (Per Carton)\n| Carton               | Graphic           | Shape       | Size (px) | Color       | Position |\n|----------------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Left (Oat)**       | Rolled Oats       | 3 curved rectangles | 15×10 | Light Brown (#D2B48C) | Centered horizontally, 10% below \"dairy free\" |\n| **Middle (Rice)**    | Rice + Hazelnut   | 5 small circles (rice) + 1 oval (hazelnut with crack) | Rice = 2×2, Hazelnut = 10×8 | Rice = White (#FFFFFF), Hazelnut = Brown (#8B4513) | Centered horizontally, 10% below \"dairy free\" |\n| **Right (Almond)**    | Almond            | Oval with indent | 20×12 | Light Brown (#D2B48C) | Centered horizontally, 10% below \"dairy free\" |\n\n\n## 6. Additional Notes for SVG Reproduction\nTo ensure the SVG is clean, efficient, and true to the image, follow these technical guidelines:\n\n### Layers\nOrganize elements into **layers** for easy editing:\n- `Shelf` (includes top surface and lip)\n- `Cartons` (sub-layers: `Left Carton`, `Middle Carton`, `Right Carton`)\n- `Background Containers` (sub-layers: `Glass Bottle`, `Ceramic Bottle`)\n- `Text` (sub-layers: `Logo Text`, `Drink Type`, `Certifications`)\n- `Symbols` (reusable elements: `Caps`, `Certification Logos`)\n\n### Paths & Fills\n- Use **closed paths** for all shapes (cartons, caps, logos) to ensure fill colors apply correctly.\n- For the carton’s side faces, use a **10° angle** (relative to the front face) to simulate depth.\n- The cap’s \"ridged\" texture can be represented with a **1px gray dashed line** (#808080) around the middle of the cylinder.\n\n### Text\n- Convert all text to **outlines** (except dynamic text) to avoid font dependency.\n- Align text consistently: \"organic\" and drink type should be left-aligned across all cartons; the circle logo text should be vertically centered.\n\n### Symbols\n- Use **SVG symbols** for repeated elements (e.g., caps, certification logos) to reduce file size. For example:\n  ```svg\n  <symbol id=\"cap\" viewBox=\"0 0 15 12\">\n    <circle cx=\"7.5\" cy=\"6\" r=\"7.5\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n    <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"6\" x2=\"15\" y2=\"6\" stroke=\"#808080\" stroke-dasharray=\"2,1\"/>\n  </symbol>\n  ```\n\n### Alignment\n- Use **alignment tools** (center, left/right align) to ensure consistency between cartons. For example:\n  - The circle logo should be centered horizontally on each carton.\n  - The certification logos should be spaced equally (5px apart) and centered at the bottom of each carton.\n\n\n## 7. Final Checks for Accuracy\nBefore exporting the SVG, verify:\n- **Color Matching**: Use a color picker to cross-check carton, text, and logo colors against the image.\n- **Spatial Consistency**: The three cartons should be adjacent (no gaps) and centered on the shelf.\n- **Symbol Reuse**: Ensure repeated elements (caps, logos) are linked to symbols to avoid redundancy.\n- **Text Outlines**: Convert all text to outlines to prevent font issues in different environments.\n\nBy following this description, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, branding, and visual style—while remaining optimized for digital use.",
  "v1_68": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, structured description of the visual elements, spatial relationships, and technical specifications. The focus is on **geometric precision**, **color values**, **texture replication**, and **layout logic** to ensure fidelity to the original.\n\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\nThe image features three primary components:  \n- **Fuji Apple**: A rounded, slightly oblong fruit (prolate spheroid) with a smooth, matte skin.  \n- **Sticker**: A rectangular label with a circular top section, affixed to the apple’s upper half.  \n- **Background**: A white, woven fabric (e.g., cotton/linen) with soft, random wrinkles.  \n\n### Apple\n- **Shape**: A smooth, organic curve approximating a prolate spheroid (vertical axis slightly longer than horizontal). The top (stem end) is marginally more rounded than the bottom (calyx end).  \n- **Key Features**:  \n  - **Calyx**: A small, shallow indent at the bottom center (10% of the apple’s width) with a greenish tint and subtle brown sepals.  \n  - **Lenticels**: Hundreds of tiny, irregularly shaped dots (1–3px in diameter) scattered across the skin, representing pores.  \n\n### Sticker\n- **Structure**: A two-part label:  \n  - **Top Section**: A circle (30% of the apple’s width) with a green background.  \n  - **Bottom Section**: A rectangle (same width as the circle, 50% of the circle’s height) with a white background and a barcode.  \n- **Content**:  \n  - **Text**: \"ORGANIC\" (small, uppercase), \"FUJI\" (large, bold), \"94131\" (medium, numeric), \"USA\" (small, uppercase) — all in white, centered on the green circle.  \n  - **Barcode**: A standard UPC-A with alternating black/white lines (varying widths) centered in the white rectangle.  \n\n### Background\n- **Shape**: A plain, rectangular field filling the entire frame.  \n- **Texture**: Soft, random wrinkles (gentle curves) and a subtle woven pattern.  \n\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n### Apple\n- **Skin Tone**: Warm red (#D84E4E) with gradient variations:  \n  - **Darker Accents**: #B53A3A (center of the apple, creating depth).  \n  - **Lighter Accents**: #E06A6A (edges, simulating light reflection).  \n  - **Green Tint**: #8FBC8F (calyx area, fading into red).  \n- **Lenticels**: Pale yellow (#FFFF99) to light yellow (#E6E600), irregularly shaped (round/elongated).  \n- **Finish**: Matte, with a subtle highlight (#FF8080, 30% opacity) on the upper right for shine.  \n\n### Sticker\n- **Green Circle**: Medium forest green (#2E8B57) with a linear gradient (lighter #90EE90 at the top, 40% opacity) to simulate gloss.  \n- **White Rectangle**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with a slight gray border (#D3D3D3) for definition.  \n- **Text**: All white (#FFFFFF), sans-serif font (e.g., Arial Bold for \"FUJI\", Arial for smaller text).  \n- **Barcode**: Black (#000000) lines on white (#FFFFFF) background, with standard UPC width variations (narrow: 1px, medium: 2px, wide: 3px).  \n\n### Background\n- **Base Color**: Off-white (#F5F5F5) with subtle gradients:  \n  - **Shadows**: #E0E0E0 (recessed wrinkles, 20% opacity).  \n  - **Highlights**: #FFFFFF (raised wrinkles, 10% opacity).  \n- **Texture**: Woven pattern (subtle crosshatch, #D3D3D3, 5% opacity) to mimic fabric.  \n\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n### Apple\n- **Layout**: Centered in the frame, occupying 80% of the vertical and 70% of the horizontal space.  \n- **Axis**: Vertical axis aligned with the image’s center.  \n- **Shadow**: Soft, light gray (#D3D3D3, 20% opacity) extending 10% of the apple’s width from the bottom edge, wider at the center.  \n\n### Sticker\n- **Position**: Upper half of the apple, 33% from the top (stem end), horizontally centered.  \n- **Alignment**: Green circle and white rectangle are vertically aligned with the apple’s central axis.  \n- **Perspective**: Slightly warped (horizontal stretch) to simulate adherence to the apple’s curved surface.  \n\n### Background\n- **Wrinkles**: Random, gentle curves behind the apple (no overlap with the fruit). Shadows/highlights follow wrinkle contours to create depth.  \n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Realism**: The image is a realistic photograph, but the SVG must translate this into vector-friendly elements:  \n  - **Apple Shape**: Bezier curves (not perfect ovals) to capture organic contours.  \n  - **Textures**: Gradients (for apple depth), pattern fills (for fabric), and small dots (for lenticels).  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light (from the upper left) creating:  \n  - **Apple Highlight**: Upper right (simulating reflection).  \n  - **Sticker Highlight**: Upper left (simulating gloss).  \n  - **Fabric Shadows**: Recessed wrinkles (darker) and raised wrinkles (lighter).  \n- **Simplicity**: Minimal clutter — the apple and sticker are the focal points, with a neutral background.  \n\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n### Sticker Text\n- **\"ORGANIC\"**: Small (10% of the circle’s height), uppercase, centered at the top of the green circle.  \n- **\"FUJI\"**: Large (30% of the circle’s height), bold, uppercase, centered in the middle.  \n- **\"94131\"**: Medium (15% of the circle’s height), numeric, centered below \"FUJI\".  \n- **\"USA\"**: Small (8% of the circle’s height), uppercase, centered at the bottom of the green circle.  \n\n### Barcode\n- **Type**: UPC-A (12-digit), but adapted for the PLU code \"94131\" (organic Fuji apple).  \n- **Dimensions**: Centered in the white rectangle, with:  \n  - **Width**: 90% of the rectangle’s width.  \n  - **Height**: 80% of the rectangle’s height.  \n  - **Margins**: Equal (5%) on left/right/top/bottom.  \n\n### Lenticels\n- **Distribution**: Random, with no specific pattern. More concentrated in the apple’s lower half but sparse overall.  \n- **Size**: 1–3px (0.5–2% of the apple’s width).  \n- **Shape**: Irregular (round, elongated, slightly distorted).  \n\n### Calyx\n- **Shape**: A small, concave circle (10% of the apple’s width) with 4–5 subtle brown (#8B4513) sepals extending from the center.  \n- **Color**: Pale green (#8FBC8F) fading into the apple’s red skin.  \n\n\n## 6. Technical Specifications for SVG Recreation\n### Apple\n- **Dimensions**: Assume a 1000px x 1200px canvas (apple occupies 800px x 1000px).  \n- **Shape**: Use a **closed bezier path** with 8–12 control points to capture the organic curve (top: more rounded, bottom: slightly flatter).  \n- **Gradient**: Radial gradient for the red skin (center: #B53A3A, edges: #E06A6A).  \n\n### Sticker\n- **Circle**: Radius = 150px (30% of the apple’s 500px width).  \n- **Rectangle**: 300px (width) x 75px (height), below the circle.  \n- **Text**:  \n  - \"FUJI\": Font size = 45px, bold.  \n  - \"94131\": Font size = 22px.  \n  - \"ORGANIC\"/\"USA\": Font size = 15px.  \n\n### Background\n- **Wrinkles**: Use **open bezier paths** (light gray, 20% opacity) to draw subtle curves. Add gradient fills (shadow/highlight) along the paths.  \n- **Woven Pattern**: A 10px x 10px grid (light gray, 5% opacity) tiled across the background.  \n\n### Shadow\n- **Apple Shadow**: A **ellipse** (800px x 50px) at the bottom of the apple, filled with #D3D3D3 (20% opacity), blurred (5px) to simulate softness.  \n\n\n## Summary of Key SVG Requirements\nTo ensure accuracy, the SVG must prioritize:  \n- **Organic Shapes**: Bezier curves for the apple and wrinkles, avoiding perfect geometric forms.  \n- **Gradients**: For depth (apple), gloss (sticker), and texture (background).  \n- **Patterns**: For the fabric’s woven texture.  \n- **Precise Text/Barcode**: Correct font sizes, alignment, and barcode dimensions.  \n- **Perspective**: Subtle warping of the sticker to match the apple’s curve.  \n\nBy following these specifications, the SVG will replicate the original image’s realism, texture, and composition while maintaining vector scalability.",

Most cubes are regular, but 10–15% are slightly irregular (e.g., 10–14 units in length/width) for realism.\n- **Dimensions**:  \n  - Length/width: `12 units` (standard), `10–14 units` (irregular).  \n  - Height: `8 units` (flattened to show depth).  \n- **Quantity**: ~25–30 cubes, scattered loosely across the bowl.\n\n#### **Sauce**\n- **Shape**: A liquid filling the bowl cavity, surrounding and partially submerging the tofu. From above, it appears as a circle (matching the bowl’s inner diameter) with a glossy, uneven surface.\n- **Details**: Tiny oil droplets (1 unit diameter) and subtle texture to simulate viscosity.\n\n#### **Scallions**\n- **Shape**: Long, thin stalks with **pointed ends**, arranged in a loose cluster.  \n- **Dimensions**:  \n  - Length: `20–30 units` (varied for naturalness).  \n  - Width: `2 units` (tapering to 0 at the tips).  \n- **Quantity**: 5–7 stalks, fanning out from the center.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is warm and vibrant, with contrasts between the creamy tofu, spicy sauce, and fresh scallions. Lighting is **soft top-down**, creating subtle gradients and highlights.\n\n#### **Bowl**\n- **Base Color**: Off-white (`#F0E6E6`) with a matte finish.  \n- **Rim**: A darker off-white (`#E0D6D6`) with **tiny brown speckles** (`#8B7355`) scattered randomly along the inner/outer edges of the rim.  \n- **Lighting**: Linear gradient on the rim (top = brighter `#F5F0F0`, bottom = darker `#E0D6D6`) to simulate top-down light.\n\n#### **Sauce**\n- **Base Color**: Deep red-brown (`#8B2323`) with a **glossy finish**.  \n- **Gradient**: Radial gradient from the center (lighter `#D9534F`) to the edges (darker `#8B2323`) to mimic lighting (brighter center, shadowed edges).  \n- **Highlights**: A small central circle (`30% of bowl diameter`) of pale orange (`#FFA07A`, 20% opacity) for the main gloss.  \n- **Texture**: Random 1-unit dots of `#FFA07A` (20% opacity) scattered across the sauce to simulate oil droplets (more concentrated in the center).\n\n#### **Tofu Cubes**\n- **Shape**: Squarish rectangular prisms (top-down view = squares with depth).  \n- **Base Color**: Pale yellowish-white (`#F0E6D6`) with a soft, porous texture.  \n- **Sauce Adhesion**: Dark red-brown (`#A52A2A`) stroke (`1 unit wide`) along cube edges to show sauce clinging to corners.  \n- **Lighting**: Linear gradient on each cube (top = brighter `#F0E6D6`, bottom = darker `#D2B48C`) to simulate depth and shadow from the sauce.  \n- **Irregularity**: 10–15% of cubes are slightly smaller (`10 units`) or larger (`14 units`) for natural variation.\n\n#### **Scallions**\n- **Shape**: Long, thin rectangles with **pointed ends** (width tapers from `2 units` at the base to `0` at the tip).  \n- **Base Color**: Medium green (`#2E8B57`) with a smooth, fresh texture.  \n- **Lighting**: Linear gradient (top = lighter `#3CB371`, bottom = darker `#2E8B57`) to add depth.  \n- **Quantity/Arrangement**: 5–7 stalks fanned out from the center (angles: 0°, 30°, 60°, 330°, 300°, 270°) with slight overlap for a natural cluster.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties (Continued)**\n#### **Additional Textures**\n- **Tofu Shadows**: Small dark circles (`10 units diameter`, `#8B2323`, 50% opacity) under each cube to simulate shadows on the sauce.  \n- **Scallion Shadows**: Thin lines (`1 unit wide`, `#2E8B57`, 30% opacity) under each stalk to mimic subtle shadows.  \n- **Highlights**:  \n  - Tofu: 3-unit circles (`#FFF3E0`, 70% opacity) on the **top-right corner** of each cube (10 o’clock position) for light reflection.  \n  - Scallions: 1-unit lines (`#90EE90`, 50% opacity) along the **top edge** of each stalk for a fresh sheen.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is **balanced and centered**, with a focus on the tofu and scallions. Key spatial rules:\n\n#### **Bowl**\n- **Position**: Centered in the image, occupying 90% of the frame width/height.  \n- **Proportions**:  \n  - Rim thickness: 8% of the bowl’s outer diameter (e.g., 8 units for a 100-unit bowl).  \n  - Inner cavity: 84% of the outer diameter (e.g., 84 units for a 100-unit bowl).  \n\n#### **Tofu Cubes**\n- **Distribution**: Scattered loosely across the bowl, with a slight concentration in the **upper half** (to mimic natural arrangement in a shallow bowl).  \n- **Spacing**: Cubes are 1–2 units apart, with sauce visible between them.  \n- **Submersion**: 30% of cubes are partially submerged (bottom 20% of the cube is covered by sauce, using a darker gradient `#A52A2A` at the base).\n\n#### **Scallions**\n- **Position**: **Exact center** of the bowl, forming a loose cluster.  \n- **Arrangement**: 5–7 stalks fanning out at 15–30° angles (e.g., 0°, 30°, 60°, 330°, 300°, 270°) with slight overlap.  \n- **Length**: Stalks are 25–30% of the bowl’s diameter (e.g., 25–30 units for a 100-unit bowl), so they do not reach the bowl’s edges.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **realistic, photographic style** with a focus on:  \n- **Texture**: Subtle details (bowl speckles, sauce gloss, tofu porosity) to mimic real materials.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft top-down light creating gradients, highlights, and shadows for depth.  \n- **Naturalness**: Irregularities in tofu size, scallion length, and speckle distribution to avoid a \"perfect\" look.  \n- **Composition**: Centered focus (scallions) with balanced tofu distribution to guide the viewer’s eye.\n\n\n### **5. Geometric Details for SVG**\nTo ensure precision, below are **measurable properties** (using a **100-unit bowl diameter** as a reference):\n\n| Element               | Shape               | Dimensions (Units)       | Position/Arrangement                  |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Bowl (Outer)          | Circle              | Diameter = 100           | Centered in the image                  |\n| Bowl (Inner Cavity)   | Circle              | Diameter = 84            | Concentric with outer bowl             |\n| Rim                   | Ring (Outer=100, Inner=84) | Thickness = 8            | Surrounds inner cavity                 |\n| Tofu Cube (Standard)  | Rectangle           | 12 (w) × 12 (h) × 8 (d)  | Scattered, 1–2 units apart             |\n| Scallion (Standard)   | Tapered Rectangle   | 25 (l) × 2 (w)           | Centered cluster, 15–30° angles        |\n| Sauce Highlight       | Circle              | Diameter = 30            | Centered in bowl                       |\n| Tofu Shadow           | Circle              | Diameter = 10            | Under each cube (50% opacity)          |\n\n\n### **6. Key Textures and Effects**\n- **Bowl Speckles**: 0.5–1 unit circles (`#8B7355`) scattered randomly along the rim (inner/outer edges).  \n- **Sauce Oil Droplets**: 1 unit circles (`#FFA07A`, 20% opacity) scattered across the sauce (more in the center).  \n- **Tofu Porosity**: Subtle 0.5 unit dots (`#D2B48C`, 30% opacity) on tofu faces to mimic soft texture.  \n- **Scallion Tips**: Pointed ends (width tapers to 0) for a fresh, sharp look.\n\n\n### **7. Lighting and Shadows**\n- **Top-Down Light**: Creates brighter areas (bowl rim top, sauce center, tofu tops) and darker areas (bowl bottom, sauce edges, tofu bottoms).  \n- **Tofu Highlights**: 3-unit circles (`#FFF3E0`, 70% opacity) on the **top-right corner** of each cube.  \n- **Scallion Highlights**: 1-unit lines (`#90EE90`, 50% opacity) along the **top edge** of each stalk.  \n- **Sauce Gradient**: Radial (center = light `#D9534F`, edges = dark `#8B2323`) to simulate depth.\n\n\n### **8. Final Notes for SVG**\n- **Layers**: Use the following layer order (bottom to top) for correct stacking:  \n  1. Bowl (Outer + Inner Cavity + Rim)  \n  2. Sauce (Gradient + Oil Droplets)  \n  3. Tofu Shadows  \n  4. Tofu Cubes (with sauce strokes + highlights)  \n  5. Scallion Shadows  \n  6. Scallions (with gradients + highlights)  \n  7. Sauce Highlight (Central gloss)  \n\n- **Irregularity**: Add 10–15% variation to tofu size (10–14 units) and scallion length (20–30 units) for realism.  \n- **Opacity**: Use low opacity (20–50%) for highlights/shadows to keep the image soft and natural.\n\n\nBy following these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, texture, and realism, while maintaining the measurable properties needed for a precise recreation.",
  "v1_71": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, technical description of its components, layout, and visual properties. The image is a **top-down, close-up view of a Caprese salad on an oval ceramic platter**, set against a dark wooden surface. The style is realistic, with a focus on fresh, vibrant ingredients and natural textures.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition centers on three core elements:  \n- **Oval Ceramic Platter**: The base for the salad, with a slight raised rim.  \n- **Caprese Salad**: Alternating slices of **tomato**, **mozzarella**, and **basil leaves**, arranged in a fan-like spiral pattern.  \n- **Balsamic Glaze**: A drizzled topping over the salad.  \n- **Dark Wooden Surface**: The background, visible around the platter.  \n\n#### Key Shapes:\n- **Platter**: Outer oval (raised rim) and inner oval (salad well).  \n- **Tomato/Mozzarella Slices**: Circular, with irregular edges (hand-sliced).  \n- **Basil Leaves**: Irregular polygons with 3–5 pointed lobes (typical of fresh basil).  \n- **Balsamic Drizzle**: Thin, curved paths with varying thickness.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified with **hex codes** for precision. Textures are described in terms of SVG-friendly techniques (e.g., dots, lines, opacity).\n\n#### **Platter**  \n- **Shape**: Oval with a **10px-thick raised rim**.  \n- **Color**: Off-white (ivory) base (#f0ebe6) with subtle gray specks (#888888) for ceramic texture (1px dots, scattered sparsely).  \n- **Rim**: Slightly darker than the base (#e0dbd6) to define the edge.  \n- **Shadow**: A darker brown oval (#221100) beneath the platter, offset **10px down/10px right** from the outer rim, with 50% opacity.  \n\n#### **Tomato Slices**  \n- **Shape**: Circular (150px diameter), 5mm thick, with irregular, hand-sliced edges (use a path with minor deviations from a perfect circle).  \n- **Color**: Bright red skin (#ff4433) fading to a lighter red flesh (#ff6655) at the center.  \n- **Details**:  \n  - Tiny black seeds (#000000) in the center (1px dots, 5–8 per slice).  \n  - A small white highlight (#ffffff) in the **top-right corner** (5px diameter) to simulate shine.  \n- **Texture**: Smooth but slightly matte, with the irregular edge adding a \"hand-cut\" feel.  \n\n#### **Mozzarella Slices**  \n- **Shape**: Circular (140px diameter), 4mm thick (smaller than tomatoes to fit underneath).  \n- **Color**: Pale white (#f8f8f8) with a subtle yellowish tint (#ffffe0) for creaminess.  \n- **Details**:  \n  - Tiny white pores (#ffffff) (1px dots, scattered) to mimic fresh cheese texture.  \n  - A soft white highlight (#ffffff) in the **top-left corner** (10px diameter) for depth.  \n- **Texture**: Matte with a slight \"squishy\" appearance.  \n\n#### **Basil Leaves**  \n- **Shape**: Irregular polygon with 3–5 pointed lobes (use a path to trace the natural leaf shape). Typical size: 50px long × 30px wide.  \n- **Color**: Vibrant green (#22aa22) with darker green veins (#118811).  \n- **Details**:  \n  - Thin veins (1px lines) running from the stem to the leaf tips.  \n  - A matte finish with subtle texture (tiny 1px lines along veins).  \n- **Position**: Tucked between tomato and mozzarella slices—some fully visible, others partially covered.  \n\n#### **Balsamic Glaze**  \n- **Shape**: Thin, curved paths (1–4px thick) with irregular, drizzled edges.  \n- **Color**: Dark brown (#331100) with a glossy sheen.  \n- **Details**:  \n  - A **white highlight (#ffffff)** along one edge of each line (1–2px thick) to simulate wetness.  \n  - Varying line lengths (50–300px) and directions (e.g., center-to-edge, cross-slice, small loops).  \n- **Texture**: Highly glossy, with uneven thickness to look homemade.  \n\n#### **Wooden Surface**  \n- **Color**: Dark brown (#442211) with lighter brown grain lines (#664422).  \n- **Texture**: Horizontal grain lines (1px thick, spaced 20px apart) with subtle curves for a natural look.  \n- **Position**: Fills the background, visible around the platter (especially at the bottom).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **asymmetrical but balanced**, with the salad filling 80% of the platter. Key spatial rules:  \n\n#### **Platter**  \n- **Size**: Outer oval: 800px wide (x-axis) × 1000px tall (y-axis) (assuming a 1000px × 1200px image).  \n- **Position**: Centered in the image (x=500, y=600).  \n- **Rim**: The inner salad well is offset **10px** from the outer rim (inner oval: 780px × 980px).  \n\n#### **Salad Arrangement**  \nThe salad is arranged in a **fan-like spiral** starting from the platter’s center and radiating outward. The pattern follows the oval shape of the platter, with more slices along the long axis.  \n- **Alternation**: Tomato → Mozzarella → Basil (repeat).  \n- **Overlap**: Each slice overlaps the previous one by **1/3–1/2 of its diameter** (e.g., a 150px tomato slice covers 50px of the mozzarella underneath).  \n- **Basil Placement**: Leaves are tucked between tomato and mozzarella, with 30–50% of the leaf visible (e.g., a leaf at (525, 600) is partially covered by a tomato slice at (550, 600)).  \n\n#### **Balsamic Drizzle**  \n- **Coverage**: Covers the top 70% of the salad, with lines extending from the center to the platter’s edge.  \n- **Direction**: Irregular—some lines follow the spiral pattern, others cross slices, and a few form small loops.  \n- **Layer**: Topmost element (sits above all salad components).  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Wooden Surface**: Fills the entire image, with the platter sitting on top. The surface’s grain lines run **horizontally** (parallel to the image’s bottom edge).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Perspective**: Top-down (bird’s-eye view), with the salad filling 90% of the frame.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, overhead light creating subtle shadows and highlights.  \n- **Color Palette**: High-contrast, with vibrant red (tomatoes), white (mozzarella), and green (basil) popping against the dark wooden background.  \n- **Realism**: Focus on natural textures (e.g., tomato seeds, mozzarella pores, basil veins) and organic arrangement (no perfect symmetry).  \n- **Depth**: Achieved via:  \n  - **Shadows**: Soft gray shadows (#444444, 20% opacity) between salad components.  \n  - **Layering**: Balsamic (top) → Tomato → Basil → Mozzarella (bottom).  \n\n\n### **5. Technical SVG Specifications**  \nBelow are precise values for SVG elements (assuming a 1000px × 1200px canvas):  \n\n#### **Platter**  \n- **Outer Rim**: `<ellipse cx=\"500\" cy=\"600\" rx=\"400\" ry=\"500\" fill=\"#f0ebe6\" stroke=\"#e0dbd6\" stroke-width=\"10\"/>`  \n- **Inner Salad Well**: `<ellipse cx=\"500\" cy=\"600\" rx=\"390\" ry=\"490\" fill=\"#f0ebe6\"/>`  \n- **Shadow**: `<ellipse cx=\"510\" cy=\"610\" rx=\"400\" ry=\"500\" fill=\"#221100\" opacity=\"0.5\"/>`  \n\n#### **Tomato Slices**  \n- **Example Slice (Center)**: `<circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"600\" r=\"75\" fill=\"#ff4433\"/>`  \n- **Flesh (Center)**: `<circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"600\" r=\"50\" fill=\"#ff6655\"/>`  \n- **Seeds**: `<circle cx=\"490\" cy=\"590\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#000000\"/>` (repeat 5–8 times)  \n- **Highlight**: `<circle cx=\"550\" cy=\"550\" r=\"2.5\" fill=\"#ffffff\" opacity=\"0.8\"/>`  \n\n#### **Mozzarella Slices**  \n- **Example Slice (Under Tomato)**: `<circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"600\" r=\"70\" fill=\"#f8f8f8\" fill-opacity=\"0.9\"/>`  \n- **Tint**: `<circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"600\" r=\"70\" fill=\"#ffffe0\" fill-opacity=\"0.1\"/>`  \n- **Pores**: `<circle cx=\"480\" cy=\"620\" r=\"1\" fill=\"#ffffff\"/>` (repeat 10–15 times)  \n- **Highlight**: `<circle cx=\"450\" cy=\"550\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#ffffff\" opacity=\"0.7\"/>`  \n\n#### **Basil Leaf**  \n- **Shape**: `<path d=\"M525 600 Q530 580 540 570 Q550 560 560 570 Q570 580 580 590 Q570 600 560 610 Q550 620 540 610 Q530 600 525 600\" fill=\"#22aa22\"/>` (adjust path for natural lobes)  \n- **Veins**: `<line x1=\"525\" y1=\"600\" x2=\"560\" y2=\"570\" stroke=\"#118811\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>` (repeat for each vein)  \n\n#### **Balsamic Glaze**  \n- **Example Line**: `<path d=\"M500 600 C600 700 700 800 800 700\" stroke=\"#331100\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\"/>`  \n- **Highlight**: `<path d=\"M500 600 C600 700 700 800 800 700\" stroke=\"#ffffff\" stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\"/>` (offset 1px from the main line)  \n\n#### **Wooden Surface**  \n- **Base**: `<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1200\" fill=\"#442211\"/>`  \n- **Grain Lines**: `<line x1=\"0\" y=\"50\" x2=\"1000\" y=\"50\" stroke=\"#664422\" stroke-width=\"1\"/>` (repeat every 20px, e.g., y=70, y=90, etc.)  \n\n\n### **6. Critical Details for Realism**  \n- **Tomato Edges**: Use a `<path>` instead of a `<circle>` for the tomato slices to create irregular, hand-sliced edges (e.g., add minor bumps or indentations).  \n- **Mozzarella Size**: Make mozzarella slices 10px smaller than tomatoes (140px vs. 150px) to ensure they fit underneath.  \n- **Basil Placement**: Rotate basil leaves slightly (10–15°) to avoid a \"stiff\" look.  \n- **Balsamic Variation**: Vary stroke width (1–4px) and line direction to mimic a real drizzle.  \n- **Shadows**: Use `filter: drop-shadow()` or offset `<ellipse>` elements for the platter shadow; for salad shadows, use `<rect>` or `<path>` elements with low opacity (#444444, 20%).  \n\n\n### **Summary of SVG Layers (Top to Bottom)**  \n1. **Balsamic Glaze** (with highlights)  \n2. **Tomato Slices** (with seeds and highlights)  \n3. **Basil Leaves** (with veins)  \n4. **Mozzarella Slices** (with pores and highlights)  \n5. **Platter** (rim + salad well)  \n6. **Platter Shadow**  \n7. **Wooden Surface** (base + grain lines)  \n\nBy following these specifications, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, texture, and realism. Adjustments to slice positions (e.g., `cx`/`cy` for tomatoes) can be made to match the exact spiral pattern, but the core rules (alternation, overlap, layering) must be preserved.",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout follows a **hierarchical focal point** (bowl → mat → background) with precise alignment for depth:  \n\n| Element               | Position (Relative to 200px × 150px Canvas) | Z-Order (Layer) |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Background**        | Fills entire canvas (`0,0` to `200,150`)    | 1 (Bottom)      |\n| **White Plate**       | Top-left: `10,10` to `70,40` (partially cut off) | 2               |\n| **Spice Shakers**     | Top-center: Left jar (`75,5` to `85,35`); Right jar (`115,5` to `125,35`) | 3               |\n| **Bamboo Mat**        | Center-bottom: `10,30` to `190,140`         | 4               |\n| **Bowl**              | Center: `100,75` (major axis 100px, minor axis 90px) | 5               |\n| **Noodles**           | Inside bowl: Matches bowl’s ellipse         | 6               |\n| **Bean Sprouts**      | Left side of bowl: `30–50` (x), `50–80` (y) | 7               |\n| **Peanuts**           | Left-front of bowl: `30–50` (x), `80–100` (y) | 8               |\n| **Carrot Julienne**   | Center-top of bowl: `90–110` (x), `40–60` (y) | 9               |\n| **Green Onions**      | Scattered: `60–120` (x), `50–90` (y)        | 10              |\n| **Cilantro**          | Sporadic: `40,60`; `70,70`; `120,80`        | 11              |\n| **Lime Leaf**         | Right side of bowl: `120,40` to `135,55`    | 12 (Top)        |\n\n#### **Key Alignment Rules**\n- **Bowl**: Centered on the bamboo mat (mat extends 10px beyond bowl edges).  \n- **Spice Shakers**: Positioned behind the bowl, overlapping slightly (left jar = red powder, right = green).  \n- **White Plate**: Partially cut off (top-left), with rice visible in the lower half.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is **realistic with subtle stylization** for vector clarity. Key artistic choices:  \n- **High Contrast**: Dark background (`#111111`) makes the bright bowl/mat stand out.  \n- **Depth Cues**:  \n  - **Bowl**: Radial gradient (light center → dark edge) simulates top-down lighting.  \n  - **Bamboo Mat**: Linear gradient (light top → dark bottom) adds dimensionality.  \n  - **Carrot Julienne**: Spiral shape with a gradient (light top → dark bottom) mimics a 3D pile.  \n- **Texture Simplification**:  \n  - Noodles: Wavy strokes (not individual strands) to avoid clutter.  \n  - Peanuts: Irregular polygons (not photorealistic crumbs) for vector efficiency.  \n- **Negative Space**: The dark background creates breathing room, emphasizing the bowl as the focal point.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No text or symbols** are present.  \n- **Critical Details for Realism**:  \n  - **Lime Leaf**: Standing upright (perpendicular to the bowl) with a glossy gradient.  \n  - **Bean Sprouts**: Tiny green tips (0.5px circles) to indicate freshness.  \n  - **Rice on Plate**: `#FFFFCC` fill with 1px `#EEEEEE` strokes to simulate grains.  \n  - **Spice Shakers**: Clear jars (50% opacity) with metal lids (silver) and vibrant powders (red/green).  \n- **Perspective**:  \n  - Bowl: Viewed from above (perfect circle with a slight ellipse for depth).  \n  - Bamboo Mat: Flat, with horizontal slats (parallel to the canvas’s top edge).  \n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these vector-specific rules:  \n1. **Layer Order**: Strictly adhere to the Z-order (background → plate → spice shakers → mat → bowl → food).  \n2. **Gradients**: Use **radial gradients** for the bowl (matte finish) and **linear gradients** for the bamboo mat (depth) and lime leaf (gloss).  \n3. **Strokes**: Keep strokes thin (0.5–2px) to avoid overwhelming the composition.  \n4. **Irregular Shapes**: Use the **pen tool** for peanuts (crushed) and cilantro (lobed leaves).  \n5. **Opacity**: Apply 50% opacity to spice jars (clear glass) and 80% opacity to powders (red/green).  \n\n#### **Example SVG Snippet (Bowl)**\n```svg\n<ellipse cx=\"100\" cy=\"75\" rx=\"50\" ry=\"45\" fill=\"url(#bowlGradient)\"/>\n<defs>\n  <radialGradient id=\"bowlGradient\" cx=\"0.5\" cy=\"0.5\" r=\"0.5\">\n    <stop offset=\"0\" stop-color=\"#FFFFFF\"/>\n    <stop offset=\"1\" stop-color=\"#E0E0E0\"/>\n  </radialGradient>\n</defs>\n```\n\n\n### **Final Notes**\nThis description balances **photorealistic detail** with **vector efficiency**, ensuring the SVG is both accurate and scalable. For complex elements (e.g., noodles, peanuts), use **simplified textures** (strokes, gradients) to avoid file bloat while maintaining realism. The key is to prioritize **recognizability** (e.g., curly carrots, crushed peanuts) over photorealistic clutter.",
  "v1_73": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** with geometric precision, proportionality, and layout context:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image depicts a **realistic industrial parking场景 (scene)** with three electric vehicles (EVs) parked parallel to a brick wall, connected to an EV charging station. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground: Vehicles**\nThree hatchback-style cars are parked in a single file, aligned with white parking lines and a yellow walkway divider. From closest to farthest:  \n- **Dark Brown (Burgundy) Volkswagen GTi**: The largest and most detailed object, occupying the left 1/3 of the frame.  \n  - **Shape**: Rectangular body with curved hood, roof, and rear; trapezoidal headlights with rounded edges; rectangular grille; triangular side mirrors.  \n  - **Key Features**: Blue \"GTi\" badge on the left grille, blue stripe across the bottom of the grille, VW logo in the center of the grille, angular LED headlights, and a white license plate.  \n- **White Volkswagen**: Parked directly behind the dark brown car, slightly smaller due to perspective.  \n  - **Shape**: Similar to the dark brown car but without the \"GTi\" badge; simpler grille design.  \n- **Dark Blue (Near-Black) Car**: Parked farthest back, partially obscured by the white car.  \n  - **Shape**: Generic hatchback silhouette with a visible VW logo on the grille.  \n\n#### **EV Charging Infrastructure**\n- **Charging Station**: Mounted on the brick wall to the right of the white car.  \n  - **Shape**: Rectangular white plastic enclosure (≈20cm wide × 30cm tall × 10cm deep) with two green circular charging ports (≈5cm diameter) on the right edge.  \n  - **Cables**: Two bright yellow rubber cables (≈1cm diameter) extending from the station:  \n    - **Long Cable**: Connects to the dark brown car, looping twice on the asphalt before plugging into the front grille.  \n    - **Short Cable**: Connects to the white car, with a small loop near the station.  \n  - **Connectors**: Black circular plugs (≈3cm diameter) at the end of each cable (plugged into the cars) and a black clip (≈2cm diameter) on the wall side (for storage).  \n\n#### **Background: Industrial Elements**\nA cluttered industrial area behind the cars includes:  \n- **Brick Wall**: Runs vertically along the right edge of the frame, extending from the foreground to the background.  \n- **Yellow Bin**: Rectangular plastic bin (≈60cm tall × 40cm wide) with a lid, leaning against the wall between the charging station and the white car.  \n- **Metal Fence**: Horizontal gray bars running across the top of the background, behind the cars.  \n- **Pallets/Storage**: Stacked wooden pallets, a coiled blue plastic pipe, black plastic crates, and a white container (all haphazardly arranged).  \n\n#### **Ground Plane**\n- **Asphalt**: Gray, granular surface with:  \n  - **White Parking Lines**: 10cm-wide straight lines marking the left edge of the closest parking spot.  \n  - **Yellow Walkway Divider**: 10cm-wide straight line separating the parking spots from the walkway (runs parallel to the brick wall).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n| Object                | Color                          | Texture/Finish                |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Dark Brown Car        | #3B1F1F (Burgundy)             | High-gloss (reflective hood)  |\n| White Car             | #FFFFFF (Pure White)           | Satin-gloss                   |\n| Dark Blue Car         | #1A1A1A (Near-Black)           | Matte                         |\n| Charging Station      | #F0F0F0 (Off-White)            | Smooth plastic                |\n| Charging Ports        | #2ECC71 (Lime Green)           | Glossy                        |\n| Cables                | #F1C40F (Bright Yellow)         | Rubbery (slight sheen)        |\n| Brick Wall            | #8B4513 (Reddish-Brown Bricks) | Matte, textured (mortar: #A9A9A9) |\n| Asphalt               | #444444 (Dark Gray)            | Granular (small gray dots)    |\n| Parking Lines (White) | #FFFFFF                        | Flat (painted)                |\n| Parking Lines (Yellow)| #FFD700                        | Flat (painted)                |\n| Yellow Bin            | #FFD700                        | Matte plastic                 |\n| Metal Fence           | #808080 (Gray)                 | Corrugated (industrial)       |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **linear perspective** to emphasize depth, with the brick wall and parking lines guiding the viewer’s eye toward the background. Key proportional and positional details:  \n\n#### **Vehicles**\n- **Dark Brown Car**:  \n  - **Position**: Parked in the first spot (closest to the camera), with its front bumper aligned with the start of the yellow walkway line.  \n  - **Proportions**: Standard hatchback (≈4.2m long × 1.8m wide × 1.5m tall). In the image, it occupies ≈60% of the left horizontal space.  \n- **White Car**:  \n  - **Position**: Parked 1m behind the dark brown car, with its front bumper overlapping the dark brown car’s rear by ≈20cm.  \n  - **Proportions**: Slightly smaller than the dark brown car (≈4.0m long) due to perspective.  \n- **Dark Blue Car**:  \n  - **Position**: 1.5m behind the white car, partially hidden by the white car’s rear.  \n  - **Proportions**: Similar to the white car (≈4.0m long).  \n\n#### **Charging Station & Cables**\n- **Charging Station**:  \n  - **Mount Height**: ≈1.2m from the ground (aligns with the average EV charging port height).  \n  - **Position**: Centered vertically on the brick wall, 0.5m to the right of the white car’s front bumper.  \n- **Cables**:  \n  - **Long Cable (Dark Brown Car)**: Extends 3m from the station, looping twice on the asphalt before plugging into the dark brown car’s front grille (≈0.5m from the ground).  \n  - **Short Cable (White Car)**: Extends 2m from the station, with a single small loop, plugging into the white car’s front grille (≈0.5m from the ground).  \n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Metal Fence**: Runs horizontally across the top of the background, 5m behind the dark blue car.  \n- **Pallets/Storage**: Stacked haphazardly between the fence and the cars, with the coiled blue pipe (≈1m diameter) visible to the left of the pallets.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph** with a **documentary-style composition**, focusing on everyday industrial life. Key style notes for SVG reproduction:  \n- **Perspective**: Slight low angle (camera ≈1.0m from the ground) to emphasize the cars’ height and the charging station’s placement.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft natural light (overcast sky) with minimal shadows, creating even illumination across the scene.  \n- **Depth of Field**: Shallow depth of field (f/4–f/5.6) to keep the foreground cars in focus while blurring the background (especially the industrial elements).  \n- **Texture Resolution**: High detail for the cars (glossy reflections, grille textures) and brick wall (individual brick edges), with lower detail for background elements (to simulate blur).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**\n- **Dark Brown Car**:  \n  - **\"GTi\" Badge**: Blue (#3498DB) uppercase letters, located on the left side of the grille (≈5cm tall × 10cm wide).  \n  - **License Plate**: White rectangle (≈30cm wide × 15cm tall) with a small blue square (#3498DB) on the left (simulates a country/state tag).  \n- **White Car**:  \n  - **License Plate**: Plain white rectangle (same size as the dark brown car’s plate).  \n- **Charging Station**:  \n  - **Small Text**: Indistinct black text on the right edge (e.g., \"22kW\" or \"EV Charger\") – omit or use generic placeholder text (≈2cm tall).  \n\n#### **Symbols**\n- **VW Logos**: Circular silver (#C0C0C0) logos on the grille of all three cars (≈8cm diameter).  \n- **Charging Ports**: Green circular symbols on the charging station (≈5cm diameter) with a small black dot in the center (simulates the plug receptacle).  \n- **Cable Connectors**: Black (#000000) circular plugs (≈3cm diameter) at the end of each cable (plugged into the cars’ charging ports).  \n\n#### **Specific Details**\n- **Dark Brown Car**:  \n  - **Headlights**: Angular trapezoids (≈20cm wide × 10cm tall) with white LED strips along the top edge.  \n  - **Grille**: Black (#000000) rectangle (≈60cm wide × 20cm tall) with a blue (#3498DB) stripe across the bottom.  \n- **White Car**:  \n  - **Grille**: Simplified black rectangle (same size as the dark brown car’s grille) without the \"GTi\" badge or blue stripe.  \n- **Yellow Bin**: Rectangular (≈60cm tall × 40cm wide × 30cm deep) with a sloped lid, leaning against the wall between the charging station and the white car.  \n- **Metal Fence**: Horizontal gray bars (≈5cm wide) with vertical supports (≈2cm wide), spaced 30cm apart.  \n\n\n### **SVG Recreation Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following geometric and proportional rules:  \n- **Cars**: Use bezier curves to create smooth body lines (e.g., the dark brown car’s hood is a curved rectangle with a 50cm radius).  \n- **Charging Station**: Draw as a white rectangle with two green circles (ports) on the right edge; add a small black rectangle (≈2cm wide × 1cm tall) below the ports (simulates a power button).  \n- **Cables**: Use bezier curves with varying control points to create natural loops (the long cable has two large loops, the short cable has one small loop).  \n- **Brick Wall**: Draw as a grid of rectangular bricks (≈20cm long × 10cm tall) with 1cm mortar lines; offset every other row (staggered pattern).  \n- **Background Elements**: Use low-opacity shapes (≈50%) for the industrial elements to simulate blur; keep details minimal (e.g., the blue pipe is a coiled bezier curve).  \n\n### **Summary of Critical Measurements**\n| Object                | Key Measurement               |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Dark Brown Car Length | 4.2m                          |\n| Charging Station Size | 20cm × 30cm × 10cm            |\n| Cable Diameter        | 1cm                           |\n| Brick Size            | 20cm × 10cm                   |\n| Parking Line Width    | 10cm                          |\n| Charging Port Height  | 0.5m from ground              |\n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, realism, and industrial context.",
  "v1_74": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and stylistic choices with precision for geometric reproduction, color matching, and spatial layout.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **landscape-oriented photograph** (assumed 1000px wide × 600px tall for SVG scaling) featuring three primary layers: a **foreground metallic sphere**, a **background modern building**, and a **subtle sky gradient**. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Foreground: Metallic Sphere**\n- **Shape**: Perfect circle (2D representation of a 3D sphere) with a textured surface.\n- **Details**: Irregularly spaced **raised small circles** (≈5px radius) covering ~80% of the sphere’s surface, creating a rough, industrial texture.\n\n#### **Background: Modern Building**\n- **Structure**: Two distinct sections:\n  - **Lower Section**: Smooth, paneled wall with **six vertical dark gray windows** (rectangular) separated by light gray panels.\n  - **Upper Section**: Curved, translucent mesh structure (half-ellipse shape) sitting atop the lower section.\n- **Branding**: A **red circular Leica logo** centered on the upper mesh section, containing the white \"Leica\" text.\n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Shape**: Rectangular gradient background visible at the top of the image, behind the building.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors are specified as **hex codes** for precise matching. Textures are described as **SVG patterns** or gradients.\n\n#### **Sphere**\n- **Base Color**: Metallic silver linear gradient (left: `#C0C0C0` (light silver), right: `#606060` (dark gray)) to simulate 3D lighting (light source from the **left**).\n- **Reflection**: Subtle sky reflection (10% opacity) using a linear gradient (top: `#F0F0F0`, bottom: `#D0D0D0`).\n- **Texture**: Raised small circles (fill: `#A0A0A0` (matte silver)) placed irregularly (no uniform grid) to create a rough, industrial finish.\n\n#### **Building**\n- **Lower Section (Panels/Windows)**:\n  - **Panels**: Light gray (`#808080`) with 1px gaps between them (fill: `#606060` (dark gray)) to simulate panel seams.\n  - **Windows**: Dark gray (`#202020`) with a faint linear gradient reflection (angle: 45°, start: `#404040`, end: `#202020`) to add depth.\n- **Upper Section (Mesh)**: Dark gray (`#404040`) with a **translucent mesh pattern** (10px × 10px squares, 1px gaps between them, 50% opacity) to mimic a metal screen.\n\n#### **Leica Sign**\n- **Circle**: Crimson red (`#E00000`) with a subtle 3D gradient (left: `#FF3333` (light red), right: `#B00000` (dark red)) to make it pop.\n- **Text**: White (`#FFFFFF`) using a **custom serif font** (e.g., \"Leica Serif\") with **compressed letter spacing** (80%) to fit the circle’s curvature.\n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Gradient**: Light gray linear gradient (top: `#F0F0F0` (pale gray), bottom: `#D0D0D0` (medium gray)) to create a sense of atmospheric depth (lighter at the horizon, darker near the building).\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nAll coordinates assume a **1000px wide × 600px tall** image (landscape orientation).\n\n#### **Sphere**\n- **Center**: `(150px, 300px)` (left 1/3 of the image, vertically centered).\n- **Radius**: `200px` (diameter = 400px, 1/3 of the image height).\n- **Overlap**: Extends 50px into the building’s left edge (covers `200px` to `300px` horizontally).\n\n#### **Building**\n- **Lower Section**:\n  - **Position**: Spans from `(200px, 300px)` (left) to `(800px, 600px)` (right/bottom).\n  - **Windows**: Six vertical rectangles, each `100px` wide × `200px` tall, spaced `10px` apart. Centered at: `(255px, 400px)`, `(365px, 400px)`, `(475px, 400px)`, `(585px, 400px)`, `(695px, 400px)`, `(805px, 400px)`.\n- **Upper Section**:\n  - **Shape**: Curved path (SVG `<path>`) starting at `(200px, 300px)` (left end of lower section), curving up to `(500px, 100px)` (peak of the curve), then curving down to `(800px, 300px)` (right end of lower section).\n  - **Mesh Pattern**: Applied to the entire upper section path.\n\n#### **Leica Sign**\n- **Circle**: Centered at `(500px, 150px)` (peak of the upper section’s curve), radius `75px` (diameter = 150px, 1/7 of the image width).\n- **Text**: Centered within the circle (baseline at `150px`), font size `50px` (1/3 of the sign’s diameter).\n\n#### **Sky**\n- **Position**: Covers the top `200px` of the image (from `0px` to `200px` height).\n- **Gradient**: Linear gradient from `#F0F0F0` (top) to `#D0D0D0` (bottom) to blend seamlessly with the building.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Modern Industrial**: Clean geometric shapes (sphere, circle sign, rectangular panels) and industrial textures (mesh, raised sphere elements) dominate the composition.\n- **Metallic/Translucent**: The sphere has a reflective metallic finish, while the building’s upper section is translucent (mesh) to add visual interest.\n- **Bold Branding**: The Leica sign uses high-contrast colors (red/white) and is centered to draw immediate attention.\n- **Depth and Lighting**: Gradients (sphere, sky, sign) and shadows (sphere on building, sign drop shadow) create a 3D effect and spatial depth.\n- **Minimalist**: The composition is uncluttered, with a focus on key elements (sphere, building, sign) and negative space (sky).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Leica Text**\n- **Font**: Custom serif with the following characteristics:\n  - **\"L\"**: Curved tail extending down and to the right.\n  - **\"e\"**: Lowercase with a closed loop (no tail).\n  - **\"i\"**: Dot is slightly oval (not perfectly circular).\n  - **\"c\"**: Curved with a subtle bulge on the right side.\n  - **\"a\"**: Tail curves upward to match the circle’s curvature.\n- **Spacing**: Letter spacing compressed to 80% to fit the circle’s width.\n\n#### **Shadows**\n- **Sphere on Building**: Soft black shadow (`#000000`, 20% opacity) at `(200px, 200px)` to `(300px, 300px)` (left edge of the building) to simulate the sphere blocking light.\n- **Sign Drop Shadow**: Gaussian blur (5px) at `(505px, 155px)` (`#000000`, 30% opacity) to make the sign stand out from the mesh.\n\n#### **Patterns**\n- **Sphere Texture**: Created using an SVG `<pattern>` element:\n  ```svg\n  <pattern id=\"sphere-texture\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n    <circle cx=\"20\" cy=\"20\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#A0A0A0\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"70\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#A0A0A0\"/>\n    <circle cx=\"80\" cy=\"30\" r=\"5\" fill=\"#A0A0A0\"/>\n    <!-- Repeat with irregular positions to avoid a grid -->\n  </pattern>\n  ```\n- **Mesh Texture**: Created using an SVG `<pattern>` element:\n  ```svg\n  <pattern id=\"mesh-texture\" width=\"11\" height=\"11\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n    <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" fill=\"#404040\" opacity=\"0.5\"/>\n    <!-- 1px gap between squares -->\n  </pattern>\n  ```\n\n#### **Reflections**\n- **Sphere**: Subtle sky reflection (10% opacity) to make it look metallic.\n- **Windows**: Faint linear gradient reflection (45°) to simulate glass.\n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout**\n- **Sphere**: Diameter = 400px (1/3 of image height).\n- **Building**:\n  - **Lower Section**: Height = 300px (1/2 of image height).\n  - **Upper Section**: Height = 200px (1/3 of image height).\n- **Sign**: Diameter = 150px (1/7 of image width); text size = 50px (1/3 of sign diameter).\n- **Windows**: 100px wide × 200px tall (1/10 of image width × 1/3 of image height).\n- **Sky**: Height = 200px (1/3 of image height).\n\n\n### **7. SVG Implementation Notes**\n- **Patterns**: Use `<pattern>` elements for the sphere texture and mesh texture, then apply them as fills to the respective elements.\n- **Gradients**: Use `<linearGradient>` elements for the sphere, sky, sign, and windows.\n- **Shadows**: Use `<filter>` elements with `feGaussianBlur` for the sign drop shadow and `feColorMatrix` for the sphere’s shadow on the building.\n- **Clipping**: Use `<clipPath>` if the sphere overlaps the building (to hide the building’s edge behind the sphere).\n- **Text**: Use `<text>` with `text-anchor=\"middle\"` and `dominant-baseline=\"middle\"` to center the \"Leica\" text in the circle.\n\nExample SVG snippet for the Leica sign:\n```svg\n<circle cx=\"500\" cy=\"150\" r=\"75\" fill=\"url(#sign-gradient)\"/>\n<text x=\"500\" y=\"150\" font-family=\"Leica Serif\" font-size=\"50\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\" letter-spacing=\"-2px\">Leica</text>\n<filter id=\"sign-shadow\">\n  <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceAlpha\" stdDeviation=\"5\"/>\n  <feOffset dx=\"5\" dy=\"5\"/>\n  <feMerge>\n    <feMergeNode/>\n    <feMergeNode in=\"SourceGraphic\"/>\n  </feMerge>\n</filter>\n```\n\n\nThis comprehensive description includes all necessary details for accurate SVG reproduction, from geometric coordinates to color values, texture patterns, and stylistic choices.

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe car occupies the **lower two-thirds** of the image, centered horizontally. The sky (upper third) and ground (bottom edge) frame the composition.  \n\n#### **Car Layout**\n- **Front/Back**: The front end (sloped hood, Ford badge) is on the **viewer’s left**; the rear (Toyo Tires text, Monster Energy logo) is on the **viewer’s right**.  \n- **Logos**:  \n  - **Ford**: Blue oval on the **front fender** (left side), above the Hoonigan logo.  \n  - **Hoonigan**: White circle with black symbol on the **mid-side** (below Ford), centered vertically.  \n  - **Monster Energy**: Three yellow/green claws on the **right side** (below Hoonigan), spanning from the door to the rear fender.  \n  - **Toyo Tires**: White text on the **rear fender** (right side), aligned with the top of the Monster logo.  \n  - **FR Badge**: Small silver rectangle on the **mid-side** (between front/rear wheels), left of the Hoonigan logo.  \n- **Driver**: Seated in the **right-hand seat** (viewer’s right), visible through the open cabin. The helmet is tilted slightly toward the camera.  \n- **Smoke**: Originates from the **front-left tire** (viewer’s left), curving upward and to the left, overlapping the car’s body.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **dynamic, action-oriented style** with a focus on speed and mechanical detail. Key artistic traits:  \n- **Realism**: Detailed textures (e.g., rubber tires, metallic rims) and lighting (soft sky glow) create a lifelike appearance.  \n- **Motion**: Smoke plumes are rendered as curved, wispy lines to convey movement.  \n- **Branding**: Logos are large and prominent, with high contrast to stand out against the dark car body.  \n- **Composition**: The car’s diagonal orientation (front-left to rear-right) guides the viewer’s eye across the frame, emphasizing speed.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text and symbols are critical for accuracy. Below is a breakdown of their design and placement:  \n\n#### **Text**\n| Text          | Font/Style       | Placement                          | Color Scheme       |\n|---------------|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Ford**      | Sans-serif, bold | Front fender (left side)           | White on blue oval |\n| **Hoonigan**  | Sans-serif, bold | Mid-side (below Ford)              | White on black rectangle |\n| **Toyo Tires**| Sans-serif, bold | Rear fender (right side)           | White on black     |\n| **FR**        | Sans-serif, bold | Mid-side (between front/rear wheels) | Black on silver   |\n\n#### **Symbols**\n| Symbol           | Design                                  | Placement                          | Color Scheme       |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Monster Energy** | Three curved, jagged \"claws\" (yellow core, green outline, black borders) | Right side (door to rear fender) | Yellow/green/black |\n| **Hoonigan Logo** | White circle with a merged \"4\" and \"K\" (black symbol) | Mid-side (below Ford) | White/black        |\n\n#### **Driver Details**\n- **Helmet**: Stars-and-stripes design (red, white, blue) with a glossy finish. Visible through the car’s open window.  \n- **Gloves**: White, matte texture. One hand grips the steering wheel (viewer’s right).  \n\n#### **Smoke**\n- **Shape**: Curved, tapering lines (5–7 main plumes) originating from the front-left tire.  \n- **Transparency**: 30–50% opacity to convey lightness.  \n- **Direction**: Plumes curve upward and to the left, overlapping the car’s body.  \n\n#### **Car Details**\n- **Roll Cage**: Straight metal bars forming a rectangular frame inside the cabin. Connects the front/rear of the car and the sides.  \n- **Rims**: Bronze, circular, with a metallic texture. Visible through the smoke (front-left tire) and rear tires.  \n- **Fenders**: Wide, angular, extending 2–3 inches beyond the car body. Painted to match the camouflage.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Geometric Guidelines**\nFor SVG accuracy, use **relative proportions** (based on the car’s length as a reference):  \n- **Car Length**: 100 units (base reference).  \n- **Car Height**: 25 units (1/4 of length).  \n- **Wheel Diameter**: 8 units (1/12.5 of length).  \n- **Hoonigan Logo**: 15 units (1/6.6 of length) in diameter.  \n- **Monster Energy Claws**: 20 units (1/5 of length) tall, spanning the door to rear fender.  \n- **Smoke Plumes**: 15–20 units long, tapering from 2 units (base) to 0.5 units (tip).  \n\n#### **Layout Grid**\n- **Sky**: Upper 1/3 of the image (light blue, soft clouds).  \n- **Ground**: Lower 2/3 (dark asphalt, white line along the bottom edge).  \n- **Car**: Occupies 80% of the lower 2/3, centered horizontally.  \n- **Smoke**: Left 1/4 of the image, overlapping the car’s front-left tire.  \n\n\n### **7. Key SVG Considerations**\n- **Patterns**: The car’s camouflage is a **geometric angular pattern** (blacks, grays, browns). Use a <pattern> element in SVG to replicate this.  \n- **Smoke**: Render as <path> elements with curved bezier curves. Adjust opacity to create depth (lighter plumes in the background).  \n- **Logos**: The Monster Energy claws are three separate <path> elements (yellow core, green outline, black border). The Hoonigan logo is a <circle> (white) with a <path> (black \"4K\" symbol).  \n- **Roll Cage**: Use <line> elements for the metal bars, with a silver stroke and slight gradient for metallic texture.  \n- **Driver**: Simplify the helmet to a <circle> with a stars-and-stripes <pattern>. The gloves are <rect> elements with a white fill.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Critical Dimensions**\n| Element           | Relative Size (vs. Car Length) |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Car Length        | 100 units                       |\n| Car Height        | 25 units                        |\n| Wheel Diameter    | 8 units                         |\n| Hoonigan Logo     | 15 units (diameter)             |\n| Monster Energy Claws | 20 units (tall)               |\n| Smoke Plumes      | 15–20 units (long)              |\n\n\nBy following this detailed description, an SVG artist can accurately replicate the image’s composition, branding, and dynamic feel. The focus on geometric precision, proportion, and color ensures that all key elements (e.g., logos, smoke, roll cage) are rendered true to the original.",
  "v1_76": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image—depicting the **Trevi Fountain** in Rome—we’ll break down the composition into precise geometric, textural, and stylistic elements. The description below prioritizes scalability, symmetry, and fidelity to the fountain’s neoclassical/Baroque design, with a focus on details necessary for vector-based recreation.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is dominated by the **Trevi Fountain**, a Baroque masterpiece, consisting of three core layers:  \n- **Background**: A symmetrical neoclassical building facade.  \n- **Middle Ground**: A dynamic, rock-like fountain structure with sculptural groups.  \n- **Foreground**: A shallow, reflective water pool.  \n\n#### **Building Facade (Background)**  \nThe facade is the tallest element (≈60% of the image height) and strictly symmetrical along a vertical central axis. Key features:  \n- **Central Niche**: A large, arched recess (segmental pediment) housing the main sculptural group. The arch has a radius of ~1/3 the facade’s width.  \n- **Side Niches**: Two smaller arched recesses flanking the central niche, each holding a secondary statue.  \n- **Columns**: Eight **Corinthian columns** (four on each side of the central niche) frame the niches. Columns are cylindrical with fluted shafts (vertical lines) and ornate capitals (acanthus leaves).  \n- **Pediment**: A curved (segmental) pediment above the central niche, containing a relief sculpture (simplified in the image but characteristic of the fountain—depicting mythological figures like Apollo and nymphs).  \n- **Windows**: Rectangular windows with triangular pediments above, evenly spaced on the upper level. Each window has a decorative frame and a small balcony with iron railings (vertical bars with a top rail).  \n- **Base**: A solid stone foundation with shallow arched openings (partially obscured by the fountain).  \n\n#### **Fountain Structure (Middle Ground)**  \nThe fountain’s base is a pile of **irregular, jagged rock formations** (organic, trapezoidal shape) that transitions from the building to the pool. Key elements:  \n- **Main Sculptural Group**: Centered in the central niche, the group includes:  \n  - **Oceanus** (god of the sea): Standing on a curved chariot, holding a trident (symbol of maritime power).  \n  - **Two Sea Horses**: Flanking the chariot, one calm (left) and one rearing (right)—representing the tides.  \n  - **Two Tritons**: Mermen guiding the sea horses, holding reins.  \n- **Side Statues**: Symmetrically placed in the side niches:  \n  - **Left (Abundance)**: Holding a cornucopia (curved, overflowing with fruits/vegetables).  \n  - **Right (Salubrity)**: Holding a tilted cup, from which water flows (symbol of health).  \n- **Water Features**: Three main cascades flow from the top of the rock formation (near Oceanus) down to the pool: a central stream and two smaller lateral streams. Frothy water (irregular white shapes) edges the cascades.  \n\n#### **Water Pool (Foreground)**  \nA large, shallow rectangle (≈30% of the image height) with rounded corners. The pool has:  \n- A **stone rim** (elevated, curved edge) surrounding it, where water flows into the pool.  \n- Reflective water with subtle ripples (simulated by small, evenly spaced circles/lines).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \nThe palette is dominated by **pale stone tones** and **aquatic blues**, with subtle gradients to simulate depth and light.  \n\n| Element               | Color/Texture Description                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Building/Statues**  | Light cream/off-white with subtle gray veining (smooth, polished stone). Columns and moldings have a slight gradient (lighter on the left, darker on the right) to mimic sunlight from the left. |\n| **Rocks**             | Tan/light brown with gray accents (rough, uneven texture—simulated by noise patterns or crack-like paths). Cracks have darker shadows (deep gray). |\n| **Pool Water**        | Light turquoise/aqua with a linear gradient: lighter (near the foreground rim) to darker (background) to suggest depth. Ripples are faint, light blue lines. |\n| **Frothy Water**      | White with a transparent gradient (10–20% opacity) to mimic foam. Irregular, jagged shapes along cascade edges. |\n| **Shadows**           | Subtle gray gradients on the right side of the building, undersides of statues, and rock crevices (consistent with leftward light source). |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe composition is **centered and balanced**, with the main sculptural group (Oceanus) as the focal point. Key proportions:  \n- **Building**: Occupies the entire width of the image; height = 1.5x the fountain’s rock formation.  \n- **Fountain Rocks**: Span 80% of the image width; height = 1/3 the building’s height. Positioned directly below the central niche.  \n- **Pool**: Spans 100% of the image width; depth (foreground to background) = 1/4 the total image height. The rim is aligned with the bottom of the rock formation.  \n- **Statues**:  \n  - **Oceanus**: Centered vertically in the central niche, 1/4 the building’s height.  \n  - **Side Statues**: Symmetrically placed in the side niches, 2/3 the height of Oceanus.  \n  - **Tritons/Sea Horses**: Flank Oceanus, occupying the lower 1/2 of the central niche.  \n\n#### **Symmetry**  \nThe building and fountain are **mirror-symmetric** along the vertical central axis, except for:  \n- The side statues (Abundance vs. Salubrity) and their attributes (cornucopia vs. cup).  \n- The sea horses (calm vs. rearing) to create dynamic balance.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \nThe fountain blends **neoclassical architecture** (symmetry, columns, pediments) with **Baroque drama** (organic rock shapes, flowing water, dynamic sculpture). Key stylistic traits:  \n- **Ornate Detailing**: Corinthian columns, fluted shafts, and acanthus capitals (neoclassical).  \n- **Naturalistic Rocks**: Jagged, irregular shapes to mimic eroded stone (Baroque).  \n- **Dynamic Movement**: Water cascades, rearing sea horses, and flowing drapery on statues (Baroque).  \n- **Realistic Sculpture**: Anatomically detailed figures (e.g., Oceanus’s musculature, Tritons’ fish tails) with lifelike facial expressions.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Recreation**  \nTo ensure accuracy, include these vector-friendly details:  \n\n#### **Architectural Details**  \n- **Columns**: Draw as cylinders with fluted shafts (thin, parallel vertical lines). Corinthian capitals: Use paths to create acanthus leaves (curved, pointed shapes).  \n- **Windows**: Rectangles with triangular pediments (paths). Balconies: Small rectangles with vertical lines (railings).  \n- **Pediment**: A curved path (segmental arch) with a simplified relief (e.g., three abstract figures) inside.  \n\n#### **Sculptural Details**  \n- **Oceanus**: A human figure with a trident (three-pronged spear). Drapery: Curved paths to simulate flowing cloth.  \n- **Sea Horses**: Two figures with horse heads, fish tails, and scaled bodies. The left sea horse is calm (head forward), the right is rearing (head up).  \n- **Tritons**: Half-human, half-fish (fish tails, human torsos). Holding reins (thin, curved lines) attached to the sea horses.  \n- **Side Statues**:  \n  - **Abundance**: A female figure holding a cornucopia (curved path with small circles/fruits).  \n  - **Salubrity**: A female figure holding a tilted cup (path) with a small stream of water (thin, curved line).  \n\n#### **Water Features**  \n- **Cascades**: Three curved paths (central + two lateral) from the top of the rocks to the pool. Add froth (irregular white shapes) to the edges.  \n- **Pool**: A rectangle with rounded corners. Use a **linear gradient** (light aqua → dark aqua) for depth. Ripples: Small, evenly spaced circles (1–2% opacity) or horizontal lines.  \n- **Froth**: Irregular white paths (10–20% opacity) along cascade edges and pool rims.  \n\n#### **Textures**  \n- **Rocks**: Apply a **noise pattern** (SVG `<pattern>`) to simulate roughness. Add darker gray paths in cracks.  \n- **Building**: A **radial gradient** (light cream → dark cream) to mimic light hitting the center of the facade.  \n- **Water**: A **linear gradient** (light aqua → dark aqua) for the pool. Use a **Gaussian blur** (SVG `<filter>`) on the pool edges to simulate movement.  \n\n#### **Lighting**  \n- **Shadows**: Add subtle gray gradients to the right side of the building, undersides of statues, and rock crevices. Use `fill-opacity` (50–70%) for softness.  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout**  \nFor scalability, use these relative proportions (based on a 1000px × 1500px canvas):  \n- **Building**: 1000px (width) × 900px (height).  \n- **Fountain Rocks**: 800px (width) × 300px (height), centered below the building.  \n- **Pool**: 1000px (width) × 300px (height), aligned to the bottom of the canvas.  \n- **Main Statue (Oceanus)**: 200px (height), centered in the central niche.  \n\n#### **Symmetry Check**  \nUse SVG’s `transform` attribute (e.g., `scale(-1, 1)`) to mirror elements (e.g., left/right columns, sea horses) and ensure balance.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG**  \nThe final SVG will be a **symmetrical, layered composition** with:  \n- A neoclassical building (smooth, gradient-filled shapes).  \n- A Baroque fountain (irregular rock paths, dynamic water).  \n- Realistic sculpture (detailed paths for figures and attributes).  \n- Reflective water (gradient + ripple patterns).  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately recreate the Trevi Fountain’s grandeur while maintaining scalability and vector fidelity.",
  "v1_77": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties into geometric, proportional, and stylistic components. The focus is on translating real-world details into scalable vector shapes while preserving spatial relationships, textures, and artistic balance.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **traditional mosque** in an urban square, flanked by modern and historical structures. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Mosque (Focal Point)**\n- **Base**: Rectangular stone structure with a rough, textured surface (dark gray brick).\n- **Arches**: 5 semicircular arches on the front facade, evenly spaced (each ~4m wide, ~6m tall). The central arch is slightly wider than the others.\n- **Small Domes**: 5 cream-colored, smooth domes (each ~2m diameter, ~1.5m tall) sitting directly above each arch. They have a matte finish and a small pointed ornament at the top.\n- **Main Dome**: A large, raised dome centered above the middle 3 small domes. It has a **tiled texture** (light gray base with darker gray hexagonal tiles) and a diameter of ~8m. A small crescent ornament tops the dome.\n- **Minarets**: 2 tall, cylindrical towers flanking the mosque’s roof (left and right of the main dome). Each minaret:\n  - **Shaft**: ~30m tall, ~2m diameter at the base, tapering slightly to ~1.5m at the top.\n  - **Details**: Horizontal bands of medium gray (every ~2m) and a small balcony (with a railing) near the top (~25m from the base).\n  - **Finial**: A pointed, conical top (~1.5m tall) with a small crescent ornament.\n\n#### **Square (Foreground/ Middle Ground)**\n- **Pavement**: A large, flat gray area (~50m x 30m) in front of the mosque.\n- **Bollards**: A grid of 40+ white rectangular bollards (~0.5m tall, ~0.3m wide) spaced evenly (~2m apart) in a rectangular pattern.\n- **Plants**: Small, low-growing green shrubs between the bollards (simplified as small circles or ovals).\n\n#### **Palm Trees (Left Middle Ground)**\n- **Trunks**: 15+ brown, cylindrical trunks (~10–15m tall, ~0.5m diameter) with vertical texture lines.\n- **Fronds**: Feathery, green foliage (multiple curved lines radiating from the top of the trunk, each frond ~3m long).\n\n#### **Modern White Building (Left Background)**\n- **Structure**: A tall, rectangular building (~20m tall, ~30m wide) with a flat roof.\n- **Walls**: Smooth white surface with **perforated upper floors** (small square holes, ~0.1m x 0.1m) and solid lower floors with windows.\n\n#### **Arcade (Right Foreground)**\n- **Structure**: A long, narrow building (~20m long, ~4m tall) with a series of **8–10 semicircular arches** (each ~3m wide, ~3m tall) supported by dark gray columns (~0.5m diameter, ~6m tall).\n- **Roof**: A flat overhang (not fully visible, but implied by shadows).\n\n#### **Background Elements**\n- **Small Buildings**: Low-rise white structures behind the mosque (right side).\n- **Vehicles**: A white van and car parked near the mosque (simplified as rectangular shapes).\n- **People**: 2 small figures (dark clothing) standing near the vehicles (simplified as dark rectangles).\n- **Sky**: A large, open sky with fluffy clouds (占据 ~50% of the image height).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nColors are defined with hex codes for consistency. Textures are represented using patterns or geometric details:\n\n| Element                | Color (Hex)       | Texture/Visual Notes                                                                 |\n|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Mosque**             |                   |                                                                                      |\n| Brick                  | #444444 (dark gray) | Rough, matte surface with visible mortar lines (#666666).                            |\n| Small Domes            | #F5DEB3 (cream)   | Smooth, matte finish.                                                                |\n| Main Dome              | #D3D3D3 (light gray) | Tiled texture: Small #A9A9A9 (dark gray) hexagons arranged in a grid.                |\n| Minarets               | #444444 (dark gray) | Horizontal medium gray (#666666) bands every ~2m; balcony railing (#666666).         |\n| **Square**             |                   |                                                                                      |\n| Pavement               | #808080 (gray)    | Smooth, matte asphalt.                                                               |\n| Bollards               | #FFFFFF (white)   | Solid, rectangular shapes.                                                           |\n| Plants                 | #2E8B57 (green)   | Small, rounded shrubs (simplified as circles).                                       |\n| **Palm Trees**         |                   |                                                                                      |\n| Trunks                 | #8B4513 (brown)   | Rough, vertical texture lines (#A0522D).                                             |\n| Fronds                 | #3CB371 (light green) | Feathery, with darker green (#2E8B57) veins (multiple curved lines).                 |\n| **Modern Building**    | #FFFFFF (white)   | Smooth surface; upper floors have perforated #FFFFFF squares (holes).                |\n| **Arcade**             | #333333 (dark gray) | Smooth columns and arches; shadowed undersides (#222222).                             |\n| **Sky**                | #87CEEB (light blue) | Fluffy clouds (#FFFFFF) with soft edges (bezier curves).                              |\n| **Vehicles/People**    | #FFFFFF (white)   | Simplified rectangles; people are #000000 (black) dots/rectangles.                  |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is balanced, with the mosque as the focal point. Key spatial rules:\n\n- **Mosque**: Centered in the **background** (占据 ~30% of the image width). The left minaret aligns with the left edge of the modern building; the right minaret aligns with the start of the small background buildings.\n- **Square**: Extends from the **foreground** (arcade) to the **middle ground** (mosque). The bollard grid is a rectangle (~40m x 20m) centered in front of the mosque.\n- **Palm Trees**: A row of 10+ trees on the **left middle ground**, separating the square from the modern building. The tallest trees (~15m) are closest to the camera; shorter trees (~10m) recede into the background.\n- **Arcade**: In the **right foreground**, extending from the bottom-right corner to the middle ground. The arches lead the eye toward the mosque (perspective: columns appear closer and larger on the right).\n- **Sky**: Occupies the **upper half** of the image. Clouds are concentrated in the top third, with open blue sky below.\n- **Shadows**: Long, soft shadows (direction: **right-to-left**) cast by the arcade, palm trees, and bollards. Shadows are #666666 (dark gray) with 50% opacity.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **photograph**, but the SVG should translate real-world details into **geometric, scalable shapes** while preserving:\n\n- **Symmetry**: The mosque’s minarets and arches are symmetrically balanced. The arcade’s repeating arches create rhythm.\n- **Contrast**: Dark mosque vs. light sky; modern white building vs. traditional brick mosque; rough palm trunks vs. smooth domes.\n- **Perspective**: The arcade and square use linear perspective (columns/arches appear smaller in the distance). The mosque’s domes and minarets are rendered in isometric or slightly foreshortened view (main dome appears larger than small domes).\n- **Texture Hierarchy**: The main dome’s tiled texture draws attention; the arcade’s smooth columns and mosque’s rough brick add depth.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Mosque Plaque**: A small, rectangular plaque above the central arch (arch 3). No legible text (simplified as a #666666 rectangle).\n- **Minaret Balconies**: Small, circular railings (~1m diameter) near the top of each minaret (below the finial).\n- **Main Dome Ornament**: A small crescent (~0.5m tall) at the top of the main dome (simplified as a #000000 curve).\n- **Modern Building Windows**: Small, rectangular windows (#000000) on the lower floors (every ~2m).\n- **Green Sign**: A small, indistinct green sign behind the mosque (right side, #2E8B57 rectangle with no text).\n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout for SVG**\nUse the following proportional guidelines (based on estimated real-world sizes) to maintain accuracy:\n\n| Element                | Proportional Size (Relative to Mosque Width) |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Mosque Width (5 arches) | 100% (base size)                              |\n| Main Dome Diameter      | 40% of mosque width                            |\n| Small Dome Diameter     | 10% of mosque width                            |\n| Minaret Height          | 2.5x mosque height                             |\n| Arcade Column Spacing   | 1.5x column diameter                           |\n| Palm Tree Height        | 1.5x mosque height                             |\n| Square Width            | 2x mosque width                                |\n\n#### **Layout Rules**\n- **Mosque**: Centered horizontally. The base of the mosque is at 60% of the image height (from the bottom).\n- **Arcade**: Starts at the bottom-right corner, extending 50% of the image width toward the mosque. Columns are spaced 3m apart (perspective: closer columns are 2x larger than distant columns).\n- **Palm Trees**: The tallest tree (left foreground) is at 40% of the image height (from the bottom). Trees recede into the background (smaller size, lighter color).\n- **Modern Building**: Located on the left, behind the palm trees. The building’s top aligns with the mosque’s minarets (height: 2x mosque height).\n- **Sky**: The horizon line is at 50% of the image height. Clouds are drawn with bezier curves (no sharp edges) to mimic fluffiness.\n\n\n### **7. SVG-Specific Notes for Reproduction**\n- **Patterns**: Use SVG `<pattern>` elements for the main dome’s tiles (hexagons) and the modern building’s perforations (squares).\n- **Palm Fronds**: Represent with multiple `<path>` elements (curved lines) radiating from the trunk top. Use a group (`<g>`) for each frond to maintain consistency.\n- **Arches**: Reuse a single arch `<path>` for the mosque and arcade, adjusting size for perspective.\n- **Clouds**: Draw with `<path>` elements (bezier curves) to create soft, irregular shapes. Use a group (`<g>`) for each cloud to adjust opacity (80–90%).\n- **Shadows**: Use `<rect>` or `<path>` elements with `fill-opacity=\"0.5\"` to mimic soft shadows. Ensure shadow direction (right-to-left) is consistent across all elements.\n- **Simplification**: Vehicles and people are simplified to basic shapes (no detail) to avoid cluttering the composition.\n\n\n### **Final Composition Checklist**\nTo ensure accuracy, verify:\n1. **Mosque**: 5 arches, 5 small domes, 1 main dome, 2 minarets (symmetrical).\n2. **Arcade**: Repeating arches/columns (right foreground, perspective).\n3. **Square**: Bollard grid (centered in front of mosque).\n4. **Palm Trees**: Row on the left (varying height, feathery fronds).\n5. **Sky**: Light blue with fluffy clouds (upper half).\n6. **Shadows**: Consistent direction (right-to-left) and opacity.\n7. **Proportions**: Mosque elements (domes, minarets) are scaled correctly relative to each other.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s composition, texture, and spatial relationships while maintaining scalability and editability.",
  "v1_78": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, the following detailed description breaks down the composition into geometric, color, and spatial components, with a focus on reproducible elements:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a vertical landscape centered on a **tall, tapering stone tower** (pagoda) flanked by **foreground trees** and a **distant city skyline**. The sky dominates the upper two-thirds, with a smooth gradient.\n\n#### **Tower (Focal Point)**\n- **Structure**: A conical, tapering tower with a cylindrical base, rising from the foreground trees to the top of the image. It tapers continuously from a wider base to a narrow top, capped by a decorative spire.\n- **Tiers**: 6 distinct horizontal tiers (visible) with decorative panels. Each tier features a row of small, rectangular reliefs or window openings (≈10px × 5px) spaced evenly around the circumference.\n- **Spire**: A stacked, decreasing-diameter \"ring\" structure atop the tower, consisting of **7 circular rings** (metallic-looking) topped by a small, pointed finial.\n\n#### **Foreground Vegetation**\n- **Dense Green Bush**: A large, irregularly shaped clump of foliage (≈200px wide × 300px tall) covering the lower left-middle of the image, obscuring the tower’s base.\n- **Leafless Branches**: Thin, angular branches (stroke width: 1px) extending from the bush and surrounding areas, with sparse yellowish buds (#FFFF00) scattered throughout.\n\n#### **Background Skyline**\n- **City Buildings**: A cluster of rectangular high-rises and mid-rises in the distant background, spanning the entire width of the image from the middle ground to the horizon. Buildings vary in height (100–300px) and width (50–150px), with flat or slightly sloped roofs.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Sky (Upper 2/3 of Image)**\n- **Gradient**: Linear vertical gradient from deep blue at the top to pale blue/white at the horizon.  \n  - **Stops**: `#0077CC` (0%), `#66B2FF` (50%), `#E6F2FF` (100%).  \n- **Texture**: Smooth, no visible details—emphasizes depth.\n\n#### **Tower**\n- **Base Color**: Muted tan-brown (`#B0A080`) with subtle brick texture.  \n- **Accents**:  \n  - Darker brown (`#807060`) for horizontal mortar lines (1px tall, spaced 5px apart).  \n  - Lighter tan (`#D0C0A0`) for highlights on the upper tiers (simulates sunlight).  \n- **Tiers**: Each tier’s rectangular openings are filled with a darker shade (`#605040`) to create depth.  \n- **Spire**:  \n  - Rings: Solid dark gray (`#404040`) with a slight vertical gradient (lighter top, darker bottom) for dimensionality.  \n  - Finial: Small white triangle (`#FFFFFF`) atop the final ring.\n\n#### **Foreground Vegetation**\n- **Dense Bush**:  \n  - Dark green (`#208020`) for deep foliage, light green (`#40A040`) for sunlit leaves.  \n  - Texture: Irregular \"clump\" pattern (small circles/ovals) to simulate leaf density.  \n- **Leafless Branches**: Brown (`#604020`) with thin strokes (1px width).  \n- **Buds**: Tiny yellow dots (`#FFFF00`) on select branches.\n\n#### **Skyline Buildings**\n- **Base Colors**: Muted grays (`#C0C0C0`, `#A0A0A0`, `#808080`) with faint pastel accents (`#E0E0E0` for top floors).  \n- **Details**: Some buildings have 1px × 1px black (`#000000`) window dots, spaced 10px apart horizontally/vertically.  \n- **Atmospheric Blur**: Low opacity (≈70%) to simulate distance.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition uses **vertical hierarchy** to emphasize the tower, with depth created via foreground/background layering.\n\n| Element               | Position (Relative to 1000px × 1000px Canvas) | Proportions               |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Sky**               | Top 60% (y=0 to y=600)                        | Gradient spans full width |\n| **Tower**             | Centered left (x=200–300, y=250–600)          | Height: 350px; Base width: 100px; Top width: 50px |\n| **Spire**             | Tower apex (x=250, y=100–250)                 | Height: 150px; Rings decrease in diameter by 5px each |\n| **Foreground Trees**  | Lower 40% (y=600–1000)                        | Bush covers x=200–400; Branches extend to x=0–600 |\n| **Skyline**           | y=500–1000 (behind trees)                     | Buildings span x=0–1000; Heights vary (100–300px) |\n\n#### **Depth Cues**\n- **Atmospheric Perspective**: Skyline is blurred/low opacity; Foreground trees are sharp/high contrast.  \n- **Overlap**: Trees obscure the tower’s base; Tower overlaps the skyline.  \n- **Scale**: Tower is significantly taller than all background buildings.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism with Muted Tones**: The image has a documentary-style realism but with soft, desaturated colors (except the green bush) to evoke a calm, nostalgic mood.  \n- **Textural Contrast**: Rough tower brick vs. smooth sky; Dense foliage vs. delicate branches.  \n- **Verticality**: The tower’s height (≈3x its width) creates a sense of grandeur; The sky gradient reinforces upward movement.  \n- **Negative Space**: The empty sky draws attention to the tower; Foreground trees balance the composition.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text**: None.  \n- **Tower Decorations**: Each tier has 8–10 small rectangular reliefs (10px × 5px) spaced evenly around the circumference. These are purely decorative and do not contain text.  \n- **Skyline Variation**: Buildings include:  \n  - Tall, slim rectangles (e.g., x=600, y=500–800, width=80px)  \n  - Short, wide blocks (e.g., x=800, y=700–1000, width=120px)  \n  - A few buildings with \"stepped\" roofs (minor vertical protrusions).  \n- **Buds**: 5–10 small yellow dots on leafless branches (e.g., x=100, y=700; x=350, y=650).\n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, use the following geometric and stylistic rules:\n\n#### **Tower**\n- **Path**: Draw a tapered rectangle (base: 100px wide, top: 50px wide) from (200,600) to (300,600) to (225,250) to (275,250).  \n- **Tiers**: Add 6 horizontal lines (1px thick, `#807060`) at y=300, 360, 420, 480, 540, 600 (evenly spaced).  \n- **Openings**: For each tier, place 8–10 10px × 5px rectangles (`#605040`) along the tier line, spaced 30px apart (circumferentially).  \n\n#### **Spire**\n- **Rings**: 7 circles centered at (250, y) with decreasing radii:  \n  - Ring 1: y=250, r=25px  \n  - Ring 2: y=230, r=20px  \n  - Ring 3: y=210, r=15px  \n  - Ring 4: y=190, r=10px  \n  - Ring 5: y=170, r=5px  \n  - Ring 6: y=150, r=2px  \n- **Finial**: Triangle with points at (250,130), (245,150), (255,150); filled `#FFFFFF`.  \n\n#### **Foreground Bush**\n- **Shape**: Use a `path` with irregular, jagged edges (e.g., `M200,700 Q250,650 300,700 Q350,750 400,700...`).  \n- **Texture**: Apply a `pattern` of small circles (`r=5px`, `#208020` and `#40A040`) repeated every 10px.  \n\n#### **Skyline**\n- **Buildings**: Draw rectangles with varying dimensions (e.g., `x=600, y=600, width=100, height=300`; `x=700, y=650, width=80, height=250`).  \n- **Windows**: Add 1px × 1px `rect` elements (`#000000`) spaced 10px apart on select buildings.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\n- **Layers**: Sky (bottom), Skyline (middle), Trees (top-middle), Tower (top), Spire (foreground).  \n- **Gradients**: Sky (linear), Spire rings (linear).  \n- **Patterns**: Tower brick texture, Bush foliage.  \n- **Strokes**: Leafless branches (1px), Tower tiers (1px).  \n\nThis description provides all necessary geometric, color, and spatial details to reproduce the image as a precise, scalable SVG.",
  "v1_79": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description of the **5-dollar US bill (front, partial view)**—focused on geometric precision, spatial relationships, and artistic details critical for reproduction:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **portrait of Abraham Lincoln** (head and upper torso) with surrounding currency design elements. Key objects include:  \n- **Portrait**: Lincoln’s face (beard, hair, collar, bow tie) with highly detailed engraving.  \n- **Text**:  \n  - Top: *\"FEDERAL\"* (left) and *\"RESERVE\"* (right), split by Lincoln’s hair.  \n  - Bottom: *\"FIVE\"* (left) and *\"DOLLARS\"* (right, partial), with a central ribbon reading *\"LINCOLN\"*.  \n  - Right: *\"SERIES 20\"* (bottom right, partial).  \n  - Ribbon above eagle: *\"E PLURIBUS UNUM\"*.  \n- **Symbols**:  \n  - **Left**: 8 vertical 5-pointed stars (each with a small central circle), with *\"5\"* symbols left of the **first three stars** (top-to-bottom: stars 1–3 have adjacent \"5\"s).  \n  - **Right**: Eagle (wings spread) holding an olive branch (left talon) and arrows (right talon), perched on a shield.  \n- **Background**: Subtle textured patterns (currency-specific anti-counterfeiting design).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is **monochromatic with purple undertones**, typical of aged US currency:  \n- **Base Background**: Pale lavender (RGB: ~#E6D6E6) with a faint yellowish tint (aged paper).  \n- **Portrait & Text**: Jet black (RGB: #000000) with dense cross-hatching for depth.  \n- **Stars & Eagle**: Dark purple (RGB: ~#4A3A4A), slightly lighter than the text.  \n- **Shadows/Hightlights**: Created via **cross-hatching** (see *Style* section below).  \n\n#### Textures:  \n- **Portrait**: Dense cross-hatching (varying line direction) for facial features (e.g., horizontal lines for forehead, diagonal for cheeks, vertical for beard).  \n- **Coat**: Pinstripe pattern (diagonal lines: top-right to bottom-left).  \n- **Background**: Subtle 45° cross-hatching (lighter than portrait) across the entire field; top border has a dense repeating \"wave\" pattern (small overlapping curves).  \n- **Eagle Feathers**: Fine, directional lines (radial for wingtips, parallel for body feathers) to simulate volume.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **symmetrically balanced** with asymmetric focal points (stars left, eagle right). Key proportions:  \n- **Lincoln’s Portrait**: Centered vertically/horizontally. His head occupies ~1/3 of the height (top to mid-neck).  \n- **Top Text**: *\"FEDERAL\"* (left) and *\"RESERVE\"* (right) are aligned to the top edge, split by Lincoln’s hair (each word is ~1/4 the width of the image).  \n- **Left Stars**: 8 5-pointed stars (each ~0.5cm tall) spaced evenly vertically (1cm gap between centers) along the left edge. The **first three stars** (top-to-bottom) have a *\"5\"* (0.2cm tall) to their left (aligned with the star’s center).  \n- **Right Eagle**: Positioned to the right of Lincoln’s shoulder, occupying ~1/3 of the width (right edge to mid-chest). The eagle’s head faces left (toward the shield), wings spread to frame the right side.  \n- **Bottom Text**: *\"FIVE\"* (left) and *\"DOLLARS\"* (right) are aligned to the bottom edge, with the *\"LINCOLN\"* ribbon (1cm tall, 3cm wide) centered between them (wrapping around Lincoln’s bow tie).  \n- **\"SERIES 20\"**: Small text (0.15cm tall) at the bottom right, just above *\"DOLLARS\"*.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image follows **US currency engraving conventions**:  \n- **Cross-Hatching**: The primary technique for depth—dense lines for shadows (e.g., under chin, around eyes), sparse lines for highlights (e.g., forehead, cheeks).  \n- **Geometric Precision**: Stars (5-pointed, central circle), shield (13 vertical stripes), and text (serif fonts) are mathematically aligned.  \n- **Symbolism**:  \n  - **Eagle**: US national symbol (shield = defense, olive branch = peace, arrows = strength).  \n  - **Stars**: 8 stars (partial view—full 5-dollar bill has 13 stars for original states).  \n  - **\"E PLURIBUS UNUM\"**: Latin for \"Out of many, one\" (national motto), curved above the eagle.  \n- **Border Framing**: Top/bottom edges have bold text (*\"FEDERAL/RESERVE\"*, *\"FIVE/DOLLARS\"*) to frame the portrait.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text uses **uppercase serif fonts** (consistent with US currency):  \n- **Top**: *\"FEDERAL\"* (left, 0.5cm tall) and *\"RESERVE\"* (right, 0.5cm tall), split by Lincoln’s hair.  \n- **Bottom**: *\"FIVE\"* (left, 1cm tall) and *\"DOLLARS\"* (right, 1cm tall, partial).  \n- **Ribbon**: *\"LINCOLN\"* (0.3cm tall) centered on a curved banner (1cm tall, 3cm wide) below Lincoln’s bow tie. The ribbon has folded ends (subtle curve) and vertical cross-hatching.  \n- **Eagle Ribbon**: *\"E PLURIBUS UNUM\"* (0.2cm tall) curved above the eagle’s head (follows the arc of the wings).  \n- **\"SERIES 20\"**: *\"SERIES\"* (0.15cm tall) left of *\"20\"* (0.15cm tall) at the bottom right.  \n- **\"5\" Symbols**: 0.2cm tall, left of the first three stars (aligned with star centers).  \n\n#### Symbols:  \n- **Stars**: 5-pointed, with a 0.1cm central circle (typical of US currency). Each star is 0.5cm tall, 0.5cm wide.  \n- **Eagle**:  \n  - **Shield**: Rectangular (1cm tall, 0.8cm wide) with 13 vertical stripes (0.05cm wide, evenly spaced) on the chest.  \n  - **Talons**: Left talon holds an olive branch (0.5cm long, 5 oval leaves with central veins, 3 berries); right talon holds 13 arrows (0.4cm long, each with a pointed tip and 3 feathers).  \n  - **Wings**: Left wing (viewer’s perspective) is extended (1.5cm long), right wing is slightly folded (1cm long). Each wing has 20+ feathers (fine lines for texture).  \n- **Bow Tie**: Large (1.5cm wide) with a central knot (0.5cm tall) and two loops. Cross-hatching: diagonal (loops) + horizontal (knot).  \n\n\n### **6. Critical SVG Reproduction Notes**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these **geometric and stylistic details**:  \n- **Cross-Hatching**: Use **path elements** for lines (e.g., Lincoln’s face: 30° lines for shadows, 150° for highlights).  \n- **Stars**: Exact 5-pointed shape (each point 0.25cm from center) with a 0.1cm central circle.  \n- **Eagle Shield**: 13 vertical stripes (0.05cm wide) – ensure even spacing.  \n- **Text Alignment**: *\"FEDERAL\"* and *\"RESERVE\"* must be split by Lincoln’s hair (use clipping paths if necessary).  \n- **Color Values**:  \n  - Base: #E6D6E6 (pale lavender).  \n  - Text/Portrait: #000000 (black).  \n  - Stars/Eagle: #4A3A4A (dark purple).  \n- **Background Pattern**: Top border \"wave\" pattern (repeat every 0.5cm) – use a pattern element in SVG.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key Measurements (for Scale)**\nAssuming the image is 10cm wide (typical 5-dollar bill width):  \n- Lincoln’s head: 3cm tall (top to chin).  \n- Stars: 0.5cm tall, 1cm gap between centers.  \n- Eagle: 2cm tall (head to talons), 3cm wide (wingtip to wingtip).  \n- *\"LINCOLN\"* Ribbon: 3cm wide, 1cm tall.  \n- *\"FIVE\"* Text: 1cm tall, 2cm wide.  \n\nBy following this description, an SVG can replicate the image’s **engraved detail**, **spatial balance**, and **currency-specific symbolism** with precision.",
  "v1_8": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties with precision, focusing on geometric details, proportions, and layout.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on **three children** standing in front of a **chalkboard**, solving math problems with **chalk**. Key elements include:\n\n#### **Chalkboard**\n- Fills the entire background (100% width/height of the viewport).\n- A large, rectangular plane with a dark green surface.\n- Faint, random chalk smudges (light green/white) scattered across the board (more prominent in the middle and right).\n\n#### **Math Problems**\n- Three horizontal equations, equally spaced across the top third of the chalkboard:\n  - **Left**: `3x3=` (uneven, childlike handwriting)\n  - **Center**: `7x2=` (slightly slanted, smudged)\n  - **Right**: `11-2=` (two uneven \"1\"s, a horizontal \"-\")\n- Each equation ends with an \"=\" sign (two uneven horizontal lines).\n\n#### **Children (3, from behind)**\nStand in a horizontal line, facing the chalkboard, with one arm raised to write. From left to right:\n- **Left Child**: Long black hair in a high ponytail, red bow at the base. Wears a **dark blue vest** (with red/white trim) over a **white shirt**. Right arm raised, gripping chalk.\n- **Middle Child**: Black hair in two small buns (top of head) with a yellow clip (left bun) and purple clip (right bun); a ponytail hangs down the back. Wears a **dark blue vest** (red/white trim) over a **pink shirt**. Right arm raised, gripping chalk.\n- **Right Child**: Short black hair (crew cut, small cowlick on top). Wears a **dark blue vest** (red/white trim) over a **white shirt**. Right arm raised, gripping chalk.\n\n#### **Chalk**\n- Three white cylindrical pieces (slightly tapered at the writing end), each gripped in a child’s raised hand. Positioned just to the right of each equation’s \"=\" sign.\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Chalkboard**\n- **Color**: Dark green (RGB: `#1E321E`), with a subtle grainy texture (simulate with a low-opacity noise pattern).\n- **Faint Marks**: Light green/white (RGB: `#E0E0E0`), irregular paths to mimic old chalk smudges.\n\n#### **Math Problems**\n- **Color**: White (RGB: `#F0F0F0`), with a rough, smudged texture (uneven strokes, slight blur).\n- **Handwriting**: Uneven, slightly slanted (10–15° to the right), with varying line thickness (thicker at the base of characters like \"3\" or \"7\").\n\n#### **Children**\n- **Hair**: Dark brown (RGB: `#1E140A`), smooth and shiny (use gradients for depth).\n  - **Left Child**: Red bow (RGB: `#FF0000`) at ponytail base (simple bow shape: two loops, one tail).\n  - **Middle Child**: Yellow clip (RGB: `#FFC800`) and purple clip (RGB: `#9600FF`) in buns (small rectangles/circles, 2–3px in size).\n- **Vests**: Dark blue (RGB: `#0A1432`), matte texture. **Trim**: Thin red lines (RGB: `#FF0000`) along neckline and armholes (1–2px width).\n- **Shirts**:\n  - Left/Right Children: White (RGB: `#FFFFFF`), cotton texture (subtle horizontal lines).\n  - Middle Child: Pink (RGB: `#FFB4C8`), same cotton texture.\n- **Skin**: Light peach (RGB: `#F8D7C9`), smooth with subtle shadows (under arms, hands).\n\n#### **Chalk**\n- **Color**: White (RGB: `#F0F0F0`), with a slight gradient (lighter at the tip, darker at the base) to simulate volume.\n- **Texture**: Matte, with a small tapering at the writing end (10% reduction in width).\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nAll elements are aligned to a **100% width/height viewport** (assume a standard 16:9 aspect ratio for SVG, but adjust proportions to match the image).\n\n#### **Chalkboard**\n- **Position**: Background (z-index: 0), fills `x: 0` to `x: 100%`, `y: 0` to `y: 100%`.\n\n#### **Math Problems**\n- **Vertical Position**: Centered in the **top third** of the chalkboard (`y: 30%` from the top).\n- **Horizontal Spacing**: Equally distributed (33% width per problem):\n  - `3x3=` : `x: 12%` (left), `width: 15%`\n  - `7x2=` : `x: 45%` (center), `width: 15%`\n  - `11-2=` : `x: 78%` (right), `width: 15%`\n- **Z-Index**: 1 (above chalkboard, below children).\n\n#### **Children**\n- **Vertical Position**: Centered in the **bottom two-thirds** of the image (`y: 60%` from the top, so their heads are at `y: 50%`).\n- **Horizontal Spacing**: Equally distributed (33% width per child):\n  - Left Child: `x: 18%` (left), `width: 20%`\n  - Middle Child: `x: 45%` (center), `width: 20%`\n  - Right Child: `x: 72%` (right), `width: 20%`\n- **Z-Index**: 2 (above chalkboard/math problems).\n\n#### **Chalk**\n- **Position**: Griped in each child’s raised hand, aligned to the **right of each equation’s \"=\" sign**:\n  - Left Chalk: `x: 27%`, `y: 30%` (right of `3x3=`)\n  - Middle Chalk: `x: 60%`, `y: 30%` (right of `7x2=`)\n  - Right Chalk: `x: 93%`, `y: 30%` (right of `11-2=`)\n- **Z-Index**: 3 (above children).\n\n#### **Key Proportions**\n- **Children to Chalkboard**: Children are ~1/3 the height of the chalkboard (their heads reach `y: 50%`, feet at `y: 100%`).\n- **Math Problems to Children**: Equations are centered **20% above the children’s heads** (`y: 30%` vs. children’s heads at `y: 50%`).\n- **Spacing**:\n  - Horizontal gap between math problems: 10% of viewport width.\n  - Horizontal gap between children: 5% of viewport width.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph**, but the SVG should translate it into **semi-realistic vector art** with:\n- **Clean Lines**: For clothing, hair, and chalkboard edges (use `stroke-linecap: round` for softer edges).\n- **Textural Details**:\n  - **Chalkboard**: Low-opacity noise pattern (`filter: url(#noise)`).\n  - **Chalk Marks**: Irregular `path` elements with `stroke-width: 2–3px` and `stroke-linejoin: round` to mimic smudges.\n  - **Hair**: Smooth `path` elements with subtle gradients (darker at the roots, lighter at the tips) for volume.\n- **Lighting**: Even, natural light (no harsh shadows). Add subtle shadows:\n  - **Children**: Small drop shadows (`filter: url(#drop-shadow)` ) under arms and hands to separate them from the chalkboard.\n  - **Chalk**: Tiny shadow on the chalkboard to simulate depth.\n- **Composition**: Balanced (three children, three math problems) with a **centered horizon line** (children’s heads at `y: 50%`).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**\n- **Math Equations**:\n  - `3x3=` : Leftmost, written in a child’s handwriting (uneven \"3\"s, a cross-shaped \"x\", two uneven \"=\" lines).\n  - `7x2=` : Center, slanted \"7\", curved \"2\", same uneven \"=\" lines.\n  - `11-2=` : Rightmost, two uneven \"1\"s, a horizontal \"-\", curved \"2\".\n- **Style**: All text uses a **custom vector font** (not a pre-installed font) to replicate the child’s handwriting. Use `path` elements instead of `text` for accuracy.\n\n#### **Symbols**\n- **Math Operators**: \"x\" (multiplication), \"-\" (subtraction), \"=\" (equality). All are drawn as `path` elements (not Unicode characters).\n\n#### **Specific Details**\n- **Vest Trim**: Thin red lines (1–2px) along the neckline (follows the vest’s collar shape) and armholes (follows the vest’s arm opening shape).\n- **Shirt Collars**: Visible under the vest’s neckline (white for left/right children, pink for middle child). Draw as a small `rect` or `path` (10% of vest height) peeking out from the vest.\n- **Hair Accessories**:\n  - **Left Child**: Red bow (two loops, one tail) at the base of the ponytail (`x: 18%`, `y: 70%`).\n  - **Middle Child**: Yellow clip (`x: 42%`, `y: 45%`) and purple clip (`x: 48%`, `y: 45%`) in the buns (10px x 5px rectangles).\n- **Hands**:\n  - **Raised Hand**: Fist shape (`path` element) with the chalk gripped between the thumb and index finger. Chalk extends 10px from the fist.\n  - **Position**: Aligned to the right of each equation’s \"=\" sign (e.g., left child’s hand at `x: 27%`, `y: 30%`).\n\n\n### **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo accurately recreate the image as an SVG, follow these technical steps:\n\n#### **1. Chalkboard**\n- Draw a `rect` (`width: 100%`, `height: 100%`, `fill: #1E321E`).\n- Add a **noise filter** (use a `feTurbulence` filter) to simulate grain:\n  ```svg\n  <filter id=\"noise\">\n    <feTurbulence type=\"fractalNoise\" baseFrequency=\"0.5\" result=\"noise\"/>\n    <feColorMatrix in=\"noise\" type=\"saturate\" values=\"0\"/>\n    <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\" mode=\"multiply\" opacity=\"0.1\"/>\n  </filter>\n  ```\n- Add faint chalk smudges: Draw 5–10 small `path` elements (`fill: #E0E0E0`, `opacity: 0.5`) in random positions (middle/right of the board).\n\n#### **2. Math Problems**\n- For each equation, draw `path` elements (not `text`) to replicate the child’s handwriting. Example for `3x3=` :\n  - **\"3\"**: A curved `path` (start at `x: 12%`, `y: 30%`, curve up to `x: 13%`, `y: 28%`, then down to `x: 14%`, `y: 32%`).\n  - **\"x\"**: A cross `path` (horizontal line from `x: 15%`, `y: 30%` to `x: 17%`, `y: 30%`; vertical line from `x: 16%`, `y: 29%` to `x: 16%`, `y: 31%`).\n  - **\"=\"**: Two horizontal `path` elements (top line: `x: 18%`, `y: 29%` to `x: 20%`, `y: 29%`; bottom line: `x: 18%`, `y: 31%` to `x: 20%`, `y: 31%`).\n- Use `stroke: #F0F0F0`, `stroke-width: 2px`, `stroke-linecap: round`, and `fill: none` for all chalk marks.\n\n#### **3. Children**\n- **Body**: Draw a `rect` for the torso (dark blue, `fill: #0A1432`), with red trim (1px `stroke: #FF0000`) along the neckline and armholes.\n- **Shirt**: Draw a `rect` under the vest (white/pink, `fill: #FFFFFF`/`#FFB4C8`), with a collar (small `rect` peeking out from the vest’s neckline).\n- **Hair**: Use `path` elements to draw the ponytail (left child), buns (middle child), and crew cut (right child). Add gradients (`linearGradient` ) for volume (e.g., `stop-color: #1E140A` at 0%, `stop-color: #3E241A` at 100%`).\n- **Hands**: Draw a `path` for the fist (`fill: #F8D7C9`), with a small `rect` for the chalk (`fill: #F0F0F0`). Add a tiny shadow (`filter: url(#drop-shadow)` ) under the hand.\n\n#### **4. Chalk**\n- Draw a `rect` (`width: 10px`, `height: 30px`, `rx: 2px`) for the chalk. Taper the tip by reducing the width to 8px at the top (use a `polygon` or `path` for the tapering).\n- Position the chalk in each child’s hand (align the base of the chalk with the fist’s thumb).\n\n#### **5. Filters**\n- **Noise**: For the chalkboard (as above).\n- **Drop Shadow**: For children and chalk (to separate them from the chalkboard):\n  ```svg\n  <filter id=\"drop-shadow\">\n    <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceAlpha\" stdDeviation=\"1\"/>\n    <feOffset dx=\"1\" dy=\"1\" result=\"shadow\"/>\n    <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"shadow\" mode=\"normal\"/>\n  </filter>\n  ```\n\n\n### **Final Notes for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Proportions**: Use a **grid system** (e.g., 100x100 units) to maintain consistent spacing and positioning.\n- **Testing**: Export the SVG at multiple sizes (e.g., 1920x1080, 3840x2160) to ensure scalability (vector art should retain quality at any size).\n- **Accuracy**: Compare the SVG to the original image frequently to check for:\n  - Correct positioning of math problems and children.\n  - Accurate colors (use a color picker tool on the original image).\n  - Realistic textural details (chalk smudges, hair gradients).\n\nBy following this detailed description, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s composition, color, and style while retaining the flexibility of vector graphics.",
  "v1_80": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image—a macro photograph of overlapping Bank of England ten-pound notes (2000–2017 series, front side)—the following detailed description covers **main elements, colors, spatial relationships, style, and technical details** necessary for precision.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image focuses on **three overlapping ten-pound notes**, with the **central note** as the primary, in-focus subject. Key elements include:  \n- **Portrait of Queen Elizabeth II**: On the **right half** of the central note (shoulders-up), with curly hair, pearl earrings, and subtle facial shading.  \n- **Bank of England Building**: Below the portrait, centered horizontally, featuring classical architecture (columns, pediment, windows, roof).  \n- **Text**:  \n  - *Top left*: \"Bank of England\" (curved, decorative serif).  \n  - *Below \"Bank of England\"*: Promissory clause: \"I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of ten pounds\" (small, regular serif).  \n  - *Lower center*: \"Ten Pounds\" (large, cursive).  \n- **Security Features**:  \n  - *Left side*: Holographic strip (rectangular) with the **Bank of England logo** (three lions on a shield, surmounted by a crown).  \n  - *Left of the building*: Metallic thread (thin, vertical) with alternating gold/red segments.  \n- **Background Patterns**: Intricate, repeating geometric shapes (triangles, squares), filigrees, and microtext (\"Bank of England\" repeated).  \n- **Overlapping Notes**:  \n  - *Top left*: Partial note with a holographic strip (orange/green iridescence) and background patterns.  \n  - *Bottom right*: Partial note with a cropped portrait (same Queen) and text.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Colors**  \n- **Central Note Background**: Warm orange-brown gradient (light orange at the center, darker orange at edges).  \n- **Text**:  \n  - \"Bank of England\": Dark brown (almost black) with a subtle gradient for depth.  \n  - Promissory clause: Dark brown (smaller, less saturated).  \n  - \"Ten Pounds\": Dark brown (cursive, with a slight gradient for 3D effect).  \n- **Portrait**:  \n  - Hair: Medium brown with light brown highlights (curly texture).  \n  - Skin: Pale peach with gray/brown shadows (subtle pores/wrinkles).  \n  - Earrings: White (pearls) with a slight glow.  \n- **Bank of England Building**: Light orange with dark brown accents (columns, windows, roof).  \n- **Security Features**:  \n  - Hologram: Iridescent orange/green with a metallic sheen.  \n  - Metallic thread: Gold/red alternating segments (metallic texture).  \n- **Overlapping Notes**: Lighter orange-brown (top left) and muted brown (bottom right) to indicate depth.  \n\n#### **Textures**  \n- **Background**: Fine, raised-texture pattern (geometric shapes/filigrees) to simulate paper grain.  \n- **Portrait**: Detailed hair (individual strands, volume) and facial features (subtle shadows for cheekbones/nose).  \n- **Building**: Crisp architectural details (columns with vertical lines, windows with frames).  \n- **Security Features**: Hologram (glossy, 3D effect) and metallic thread (shiny, reflective).  \n\n#### **Visual Properties**  \n- **Lighting**: Soft, diffused light with highlights on raised elements (hair, text, building columns) to emphasize texture.  \n- **Shadows**: Subtle, cool-gray shadows (under portrait, text) for depth.  \n- **Focus**: Central note is sharp; overlapping notes are slightly desaturated/less detailed to imply blur.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe central note dominates the composition, with overlapping notes adding depth. Key alignments:  \n- **Central Note Layout**:  \n  - *Top left*: \"Bank of England\" (curved along the top edge, from left corner to center).  \n  - *Below \"Bank of England\"*: Promissory clause (left-aligned, 1/2 the width of the \"Bank of England\" text).  \n  - *Right half*: Portrait (right edge aligned with the note’s right edge; height = 1/3 of the note).  \n  - *Below portrait*: Bank of England building (centered horizontally; width = 1/3 of the note, height = 1/4 of the note).  \n  - *Lower center*: \"Ten Pounds\" (centered horizontally; bottom edge aligned with the note’s bottom edge).  \n  - *Left side*: Holographic strip (vertical, 1/10 of the note’s width) and metallic thread (parallel to the strip, 1/20 of the width).  \n- **Overlapping Notes**:  \n  - *Top left*: Overlaps the central note’s top left corner (1/4 of the central note’s width).  \n  - *Bottom right*: Overlaps the central note’s bottom right corner (1/3 of the central note’s width).  \n- **Depth**: Central note is in the foreground (highest z-index); overlapping notes are in the background (lower z-index, slightly transparent).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Genre**: Macro documentary photography (realistic, high-detail).  \n- **Artistic Focus**: Emphasis on the **intricate design and security features** of the currency.  \n- **Composition**: Dynamic, with overlapping notes creating movement. The central note’s portrait and text guide the viewer’s eye.  \n- **Vector Adaptation**: Use gradients for color depth, patterns for texture, and detailed paths for portrait/building. Overlapping notes can be layered with 80% opacity to show depth.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**  \n- **\"Bank of England\"**: Curved, decorative serif font (e.g., \"Baskerville Old Face\" with flourishes). Letter height = 1/10 of the central note’s height.  \n- **Promissory Clause**: Small, regular serif (e.g., \"Times New Roman\"). Letter height = 1/20 of the central note’s height.  \n- **\"Ten Pounds\"**: Large, cursive font (e.g., \"Edwardian Script\"). Letter height = 1/5 of the central note’s height.  \n- **Microtext**: \"Bank of England\" repeated in 1pt font around the central note’s edges and background patterns.  \n\n#### **Symbols**  \n- **Bank of England Logo**: Three lions passant guardant on a shield, surmounted by a crown (holographic strip).  \n- **Portrait**: Queen Elizabeth II (symbol of authority).  \n- **Building**: Bank of England headquarters (symbol of issuing institution).  \n\n#### **Security Features**  \n- **Holographic Strip**: Rectangular (10mm x 50mm), left side of the central note.

Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe SVG should emulate a **simplified realistic style** with:  \n- **Flat Colors**: Dominant for large elements (ATM, hand, keypad) to keep the design clean.  \n- **Subtle Gradients**: For button shine (red/green buttons) and hand shadows (to add depth without complexity).  \n- **Rounded Edges**: For the hand, keypad hood, and buttons (to mimic real-world objects).  \n- **Minimal Texture**: Limited to the banknote (stripes) and ATM slot (depth) to avoid cluttering the vector.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nAll text and icons are critical for accuracy. Use **sans-serif fonts** (e.g., Arial) for readability:  \n\n| Element | Text/Symbol | Position | Color | Font Size (px) |\n|---------|-------------|----------|-------|----------------|\n| **Banknote** | \"200\" (large numerals) | Right edge, vertically centered | `#32CD32` | 40 |\n| **Banknote** | Portrait name/text (e.g., \"SVERIGES RIKSBANK\") | Center, below portrait | `#000000` | 12 |\n| **Red \"AVBRYT\" Button** | \"AVBRYT\" (Swedish for \"Cancel\") + White X icon | Text: Center; X: Top-right corner | Text: `#FFFFFF`; X: `#FFFFFF` | Text: 14; X: 10 |\n| **Yellow \"FEL\" Button** | \"FEL\" (Swedish for \"Error\") | Center | `#000000` | 14 |\n| **Gray \"OTAL\" Button** | \"OTAL\" (Swedish for \"Total\") | Center | `#000000` | 14 |\n| **Green \"TILL\" Button** | \"TILL\" (Swedish for \"To\") + White checkmark icon | Text: Center; Checkmark: Center | Text: `#FFFFFF`; Checkmark: `#FFFFFF` | Text: 14; Checkmark: 16 |\n| **Number Buttons** | 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, -, + | Center of each button | `#000000` | 18 |\n\n\n### **Key Layout Notes for SVG**\n- **Layer Order**: From front to back: **Hand → Banknote → Keypad Hood → Keypad Buttons → ATM Body**.  \n- **Shadows**:  \n  - ATM slot: Dark gray (`#808080`) on the bottom edge to indicate recess.  \n  - Keypad hood: Soft shadow (`#808080`) on the keypad panel (10px offset).  \n  - Hand: Dark flesh tone (`#DAA520`) on the ATM body where the palm presses against it.  \n- **Banknote Notch**: A 100px × 20px rectangular cutout at the top center of the banknote (aligned with the ATM slot’s internal guide).  \n\n\nThis description provides all geometric, color, and layout details needed to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. Adjustments to proportions (e.g., button spacing) can be made for responsiveness, but the core elements and relationships must remain consistent.",
  "v1_82": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, technical description organized by the requested categories, with a focus on geometric precision, spatial relationships, and visual properties:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is an **anterior-posterior (AP) chest X-ray**, capturing the thoracic cavity and upper abdomen. Key structures (from superficial to deep) include:\n\n#### **Skeletal Structures**\n- **Vertebral Column**: A vertical, midline structure spanning the entire height of the image. Composed of **12 thoracic vertebrae**, visible as stacked, rectangular \"blocks\" with slightly rounded edges. Intervertebral discs appear as thin, darker (less radiopaque) horizontal lines between each vertebra. The upper vertebrae (T1–T4) are more distinct, with the lower vertebrae (T5–T12) fading into the soft tissue shadow of the heart.\n- **Ribs**: 12 pairs of curved, horizontal-to-oblique bones extending bilaterally from the vertebrae to the sternum.  \n  - **Upper Ribs (1–6)**: More horizontal, with sharp, dense edges. Attach to the sternum via costal cartilages (faint, gray lines).  \n  - **Lower Ribs (7–12)**: More oblique (angling downward), with broader, less distinct edges. The 11th and 12th ribs are \"floating\" (not attached to the sternum) and appear shorter.  \n  - **Costophrenic Angles**: Sharp, triangular junctions where the lower ribs meet the diaphragm (visible as dark, acute angles at the bottom corners of the lung fields).\n- **Clavicles**: Two horizontal, curved bones at the top of the image, forming the \"shoulder girdle.\" Each clavicle extends from the **acromion process** (lateral end, connecting to the scapula) medially to the **sternoclavicular joint** (articulating with the sternum). The lateral third of each clavicle is slightly convex upward.\n- **Sternum**: A faint, vertical, midline bone anterior to the heart. Only the **manubrium** (upper, broader portion) and **body** (middle, narrower portion) are visible as a thin, gray line; the xiphoid process (lower tip) is indistinct.\n\n#### **Soft Tissues & Viscera**\n- **Lungs**: Two large, symmetric, **radiolucent** (dark) fields occupying 60–70% of the image, lateral to the spine and heart. Characterized by:  \n  - **Bronchial Markings**: Fine, branching, gray lines representing the tracheobronchial tree (mainstem bronchi, lobar bronchi, and segmental bronchi). More prominent in the upper lungs and near the hilum (root of the lung).  \n  - **Hilum**: A dense, grayish-white \"node\" at the center of each lung, where bronchi, arteries, and veins enter/exit. The left hilum is slightly higher than the right (normal variation).  \n  - **Costophrenic Angles**: Sharp and clear (no fluid accumulation, a normal finding).\n- **Heart & Mediastinum**: A large, **radiopaque** (white) mass occupying the central third of the image, anterior to the spine. Key features:  \n  - **Silhouette**: Roughly triangular, with a broad base at the top (level of the clavicles) and a pointed apex (inferior tip) angled **5–10° to the left** of midline (normal leftward shift).  \n  - **Aortic Arch**: A curved, white \"knob\" at the top of the heart shadow, representing the ascending/descending aorta. It extends from the right hilum to the left, merging with the descending aorta (a thin, white line running parallel to the spine).  \n  - **Right Atrium**: The rounded, right border of the heart, adjacent to the right lung.  \n  - **Left Ventricle**: The sharp, inferior apex of the heart, forming the left border.  \n- **Diaphragm**: A curved, radiopaque line separating the lungs (superior) from the abdomen (inferior). It has two \"domes\":  \n  - **Right Hemidiaphragm**: Higher (by ~1–2 cm) and more prominent than the left, due to the liver pushing upward.  \n  - **Left Hemidiaphragm**: Lower and flatter, with a small indentation where the heart rests (**cardiac notch**).  \n- **Abdomen**: A dark, radiolucent area inferior to the diaphragm, containing the liver (right, faint gray shadow) and stomach (left, no distinct features in this image).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is a **grayscale (black-and-white) radiograph** with a high-contrast, grainy texture (typical of film-based X-rays). Key tonal relationships:  \n- **Radiopaque (White/Dense)**: Bones (ribs, vertebrae, clavicles), heart, aorta, and diaphragm. These structures absorb more X-rays, appearing bright white.  \n- **Radiolucent (Black/Less Dense)**: Lungs (air-filled), abdomen (soft tissue/fluid). These structures absorb fewer X-rays, appearing dark black.  \n- **Gray (Intermediate Density)**: Soft tissues (bronchial markings, hilum, sternum), fat, and cartilage. Gradations of gray indicate varying tissue density.  \n\n#### **Texture**\n- **Uniform Graininess**: A fine, random \"noise\" throughout the image, characteristic of traditional X-ray film.  \n- **Bones**: Sharp, crisp edges with a smooth, dense texture.  \n- **Lungs**: Porous, with a \"mottled\" appearance due to bronchial markings and air-tissue interfaces.  \n- **Heart**: Smooth, solid texture with a well-defined border (**cardiac silhouette**).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image is **centered on the midline** (spine) with strict bilateral symmetry (except for minor diaphragm/asymmetry). Key positional rules:  \n- **Vertebral Column**: Exact midline, extending from the top (T1) to the bottom (T12) of the image.  \n- **Ribs**: Symmetrically arranged on either side of the spine. Each rib curves **outward and forward** from the vertebra, with the 1st rib nearly horizontal and the 12th rib angled ~45° downward.  \n- **Lungs**: Occupy the **lateral two-thirds** of the image, with the left lung slightly smaller than the right (due to the heart).  \n- **Heart**: Located in the **mediastinum** (central compartment), anterior to the spine. Its apex points to the **left lower quadrant** of the image.  \n- **Diaphragm**: Sits at the **inferior third** of the image, with the right dome at ~1/3 from the bottom and the left dome at ~1/4 from the bottom.  \n- **Clavicles**: Span the **superior third** of the image, from the shoulders (lateral) to the sternum (medial). The left clavicle is slightly more prominent due to the AP view.  \n- **Costophrenic Angles**: Located at the **bottom corners** of the lung fields, between the lower ribs and diaphragm.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **functional medical document**, not an artistic work. Its style is defined by:  \n- **Centered Composition**: The spine and heart dominate the visual hierarchy, with lungs framing the sides.  \n- **High Contrast**: Maximizes differentiation between bones, soft tissue, and air (critical for medical diagnosis).  \n- **AP View Orientation**: The X-ray source is **anterior (front)**, and the film is **posterior (back)**. This results in a larger cardiac silhouette (compared to a PA view) and more prominent vertebral bodies.  \n- **Field of View (FOV)**: Captures the entire thoracic cavity (from clavicles to diaphragm) plus the upper abdomen (to the 12th rib).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Laterality Marker**: A small, white \"L\" in the **top-right corner** of the image, indicating the **left side of the patient** (standard for AP views, where the right side of the image corresponds to the patient’s left).  \n- **No Other Text/Symbols**: No patient ID, date, or technical markers (e.g., \"AP\") are visible in the provided image.  \n\n\n### **Critical Geometric Details for SVG Recreation**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these measurable proportions and shapes:  \n- **Cardiothoracic Ratio (CTR)**: The width of the heart (at its widest point) divided by the width of the thoracic cavity (at the same level). Normal CTR is **≤0.5** (heart occupies ≤50% of the thoracic width). In this image, the CTR is ~0.45 (heart width ~45% of thoracic width).  \n- **Rib Spacing**: Upper ribs (1–6) are spaced ~1–2 cm apart; lower ribs (7–12) are spaced ~2–3 cm apart (increasing as ribs angle downward).  \n- **Diaphragm Curve**: The right hemidiaphragm has a radius of curvature ~1.5x larger than the left. The highest point of the right dome is ~1 cm to the right of midline; the left dome is ~1 cm to the left of midline.  \n- **Vertebral Size**: Each thoracic vertebra is ~2 cm tall (vertical) and ~1.5 cm wide (horizontal) at the base. Intervertebral discs are ~0.5 cm tall.  \n- **Clavicle Length**: Each clavicle is ~15 cm long (in a standard adult), with the lateral third (acromial end) accounting for ~5 cm.  \n\n\n### **6. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nAs a medical image, the style is **functional and diagnostic**, not artistic. Key traits:  \n- **Objective Framing**: The FOV is tightly cropped to the thoracic cavity (no extraneous tissue), focusing on clinically relevant structures.  \n- **Symmetry**: Strict bilateral symmetry (except for minor anatomical variations) to aid in detecting abnormalities.  \n- **Contrast Optimization**: High contrast between bones/soft tissue/air to maximize diagnostic utility.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\nTo replicate this image accurately:  \n1. **Draw the Skeleton First**: Use precise midline alignment for the spine; symmetric, curved ribs; and horizontal clavicles.  \n2. **Add Soft Tissues**: Use dark fills for lungs, white fills for the heart, and gray for bronchial markings.  \n3. **Incorporate Texture**: Add a uniform grain filter (noise) to mimic film grain.  \n4. **Maintain Proportions**: Adhere to the cardiothoracic ratio, rib spacing, and vertebral dimensions.  \n5. **Include Markers**: Add the \"L\" in the top-right corner (12pt, sans-serif, white).  \n\nThe final SVG should prioritize **geometric accuracy** (e.g., rib curvature, vertebral stacking) and **tonal fidelity** (high contrast, grayscale gradients) to match the original X-ray’s diagnostic appearance.",
  "v1_83": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this posteroanterior (PA) chest X-ray, the following detailed description covers anatomical structures, markings, spatial relationships, and visual properties. The image is a diagnostic radiograph with high contrast between dense (white) and radiolucent (gray/black) tissues, typical of medical imaging.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe primary subject is a **PA chest X-ray** showing the rib cage, lungs, heart, diaphragm, clavicles, and metallic foreign bodies. Key elements include:  \n- **Rib Cage**: 10–11 pairs of curved, horizontal ribs (slightly downward-sloping from center to sides), attached to the sternum (central vertical bone) and extending to the chest wall.  \n- **Clavicles**: Two symmetric, curved \"collarbones\" at the top of the chest, connecting the sternum to the shoulders (acromion process, a rounded lateral end).  \n- **Heart**: A large, rounded white shadow in the central mediastinum (occupying ~1/3 of the chest width), with a rounded left border (left ventricle) and straight right border (right atrium).  \n- **Lungs**: Two dark gray, radiolucent fields (left/right) with branching **bronchovascular markings** (tree-like lines representing bronchi/blood vessels).  \n- **Diaphragm**: A faint, curved line separating the chest from the abdomen, with the right hemidiaphragm (liver side) higher than the left.  \n- **Metallic Fragments**: 6–7 small, linear/lightly curved metallic densities in the **left lung** (viewer’s left), between the 3rd and 6th ribs.  \n- **Text/Arrow**: A right-pointing arrow and the label \"H8\" in the upper right corner (patient’s right).  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is **grayscale** with a high dynamic range:  \n- **White (Dense Tissues)**: Ribs, clavicles, heart, metallic fragments (brightest, more dense than bone), and the abdomen (soft tissue/organs).  \n- **Gray (Radiolucent Tissues)**: Lungs (darker peripherally, lighter centrally due to bronchovascular markings), diaphragm (faint gray), and soft tissue (shoulders/arms, dark gray).  \n- **Black**: Background (peripheral edges of the image) and areas of maximal lung lucency (e.g., peripheral lung fields).  \n\n#### Key Textures:  \n- **Lungs**: Grainy, with branching **bronchovascular markings** (light gray, 0.5–1px lines) that thin peripherally.  \n- **Bone (Ribs/Clavicles)**: Smooth, solid white strokes.  \n- **Metallic Fragments**: Solid white, highly reflective (stand out from bone).  \n- **Noise**: Subtle grain (simulated with small, random gray dots) to mimic X-ray film grain.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses **relative proportions** (based on standard PA chest X-ray anatomy):  \n- **Aspect Ratio**: ~4:3 (typical for radiographs).  \n- **Ribs**: Evenly spaced (~1–2cm apart in the image), with the 1st rib shortest (under the clavicle) and 7th rib longest.  \n- **Heart**: Centered in the mediastinum, with the apex (bottom) pointing slightly left. The **cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)** (heart width/chest width) is normal (<0.5).  \n- **Lungs**: Occupy the left/right halves of the chest, with the left lung containing metallic fragments.  \n- **Metallic Fragments**: Located in the **upper-mid left lung** (viewer’s left), between the 3rd and 6th ribs. Positions (relative to the lung field):  \n  - 3rd–4th rib: 2 fragments (lateral/medial thirds).  \n  - 4th–5th rib: 2 fragments (lateral/medial thirds).  \n  - 5th–6th rib: 2 fragments (lateral/medial thirds).  \n- **Clavicles**: Symmetric, curving from the sternum (center top) to the shoulders (sides).  \n- **Diaphragm**: Right hemidiaphragm at ~5th rib level (posterior), left at ~6th rib level (normal due to liver).  \n- **Text/Arrow**: \"H8\" and arrow are in the **upper right corner** (above the right clavicle), with the arrow pointing to the patient’s right.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **documentary-style diagnostic radiograph** with no artistic interpretation. Key style traits:  \n- **High Contrast**: Sharp distinction between bone (white) and lungs (dark gray).  \n- **Grain/Noise**: Subtle film grain (simulated with small, random gray dots) to mimic real X-rays.  \n- **Anatomical Realism**: Proportions and structures follow standard human anatomy (e.g., symmetric clavicles, normal CTR).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **\"H8\" Label**: A sans-serif, capitalized text (\"H\" + \"8\") in white, ~5mm tall.  \n- **Arrow**: A right-pointing triangular arrow (3mm long, 1mm base) positioned **to the left of \"H8\"**, pointing to the patient’s right.  \n- **Metallic Fragments**: Linear/lightly curved, 0.5–3mm long, and **brighter than bone** (solid white). Their positions are critical for reproduction:  \n  - **Fragment 1**: 3rd–4th rib, left lung, lateral third (near chest wall).  \n  - **Fragment 2**: 3rd–4th rib, left lung, medial third (near hilum).  \n  - **Fragment 3**: 4th–5th rib, left lung, lateral third.  \n  - **Fragment 4**: 4th–5th rib, left lung, medial third.  \n  - **Fragment 5**: 5th–6th rib, left lung, lateral third.  \n  - **Fragment 6**: 5th–6th rib, left lung, medial third.  \n\n\n### **SVG-Specific Geometric Details and Layout**\nTo recreate the image accurately, use the following **relative proportions** (based on a 1000px × 750px SVG canvas):  \n- **Ribs**: 10 pairs, each as a **Bezier curve** with a **1px white stroke**. The 1st rib is 150px long (under the clavicle), 2nd rib 200px, ..., 7th rib 300px (longest), 8th–10th ribs shorten to 250px.  \n- **Clavicles**: Two **Bezier curves** (2px white stroke) from the center top (x=500px, y=50px) to the sides (x=100px/y=100px and x=900px/y=100px). Lateral ends are rounded (10px arc).  \n- **Sternum**: A vertical line (1px white) from the clavicles (y=50px) to the xiphoid process (y=400px).  \n- **Heart**: A closed **Bezier curve** (white fill) with:  \n  - Left border: Rounded arc from (x=350px, y=200px) to (x=350px, y=500px).  \n  - Right border: Straight line from (x=650px, y=200px) to (x=650px, y=500px).  \n  - Top/bottom: Curved lines connecting left/right borders.  \n- **Lungs**: Two closed **Bezier curves** (dark gray fill: #333333) with **bronchovascular markings** (light gray: #666666, 0.5px lines branching from the hilum).  \n- **Diaphragm**: A **Bezier curve** (light gray stroke: #999999) from (x=100px, y=600px) to (x=900px, y=650px), curving upward (right side higher).  \n- **Metallic Fragments**: 6–7 **line segments** (1px white stroke, solid white fill) placed in the left lung (x=200–400px, y=250–500px) between ribs.  \n- **Text/Arrow**:  \n  - **Arrow**: A triangular path (white fill) with points at (x=800px, y=80px), (x=820px, y=80px), (x=810px, y=70px) (pointing right).  \n  - **\"H8\"**: Text element (font: Arial, 12px, white) at (x=825px, y=85px).  \n- **Soft Tissue**: A closed path (dark gray fill: #111111) around the rib cage (x=50–950px, y=50–600px).  \n- **Abdomen**: A closed path (light gray fill: #cccccc) below the diaphragm (x=50–950px, y=600–750px).  \n\n\n### **Critical Notes for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Contrast**: Ensure metallic fragments are brighter than bone (use solid white, no transparency).  \n- **Bronchovascular Markings**: Use branching, thinning lines (0.5–1px) in the lungs to mimic real X-ray patterns.  \n- **Noise**: Add a subtle **Gaussian blur** (0.5px) or a **noise pattern** (small, random gray dots) to simulate film grain.  \n- **Proportions**: Maintain the cardiothoracic ratio (<0.5) and rib spacing to preserve anatomical realism.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as an SVG, including geometric shapes, relative positions, and visual properties.",
  "v1_84": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this chest X-ray, the following detailed description breaks down the image into geometric, textural, and spatial components, with a focus on scalable proportions and diagnostic features.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **posteroanterior (PA) chest X-ray** (patient facing the imaging plate) dominated by skeletal, soft tissue, and medical implant structures. Key elements include:  \n- **Skeletal System**:  \n  - **Clavicles**: Two curved, horizontal bones at the top of the chest, connecting the sternum to the shoulders.  \n  - **Sternum**: A vertical, rectangular bone (wider at the top, tapering slightly) running through the center of the chest, connecting to the clavicles (manubrium) and costal cartilages (body).  \n  - **Ribs**: 12 pairs of curved, arc-shaped bones originating from the thoracic spine (not fully visible) and extending anteriorly. Ribs 1–7 (true ribs) connect directly to the sternum via costal cartilages; ribs 8–10 (false ribs) connect to the cartilage of the rib above; ribs 11–12 (floating ribs) are unconnected anteriorly.  \n- **Soft Tissues**:  \n  - **Heart**: An irregular oval in the lower center, overlapping the lower lungs. The apex points left, and the base (top) is wider.  \n  - **Lungs**: Two dark, triangular fields (right lung slightly larger than left) flanking the sternum, with fine branching **bronchovascular markings** (bronchi and blood vessels).  \n  - **Diaphragm**: A smooth, curved line separating the chest (thorax) from the abdomen (light gray below), with a higher right peak (due to the liver).  \n- **Medical Implants**:  \n  - **Pacemaker/Defibrillator**: An oval device on the **patient’s left** (image right), just below the clavicle, with 2 thin leads extending into the heart.  \n  - **Port-a-Cath**: A smaller oval device on the **patient’s right** (image left), just below the clavicle, with 1 short lead.  \n- **Laterality Marker**: A vertical \"L\" (patient’s left) at the top right corner.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe image is **grayscale**, with contrast driven by tissue density (radiolucency):  \n- **Black**: Background (outside the chest).  \n- **White/Light Gray**: Dense structures (bones, heart, implants).  \n  - **Bones**: Porous texture (cortical bone) with smooth outer edges.  \n  - **Heart**: Smooth, homogeneous density.  \n  - **Implants**: Metallic sheen (slightly reflective).  \n- **Dark Gray/Black**: Radiolucent structures (lungs, air).  \n  - **Lungs**: Fine, granular texture with branching **bronchovascular markings** (thin, light gray lines).  \n- **Marker**: Black rectangular background with a white, sans-serif \"L\".  \n\n**Noise**: Subtle grain (typical of X-rays) in dark areas (lungs), less pronounced in light areas (bones/heart).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nUse **relative percentages** for scalability (image width = 100%, height = 140% (taller than wide, standard PA)).  \n\n| Element | Position (Width%, Height%) | Dimensions | Notes |\n|---------|-----------------------------|------------|-------|\n| **Entire Chest** | Centered (50%, 50%) | 90% width, 95% height | Fills most of the image. |\n| **Clavicles** | Right: (20%, 10%); Left: (80%, 10%) | 30% width each, curved (radius = 60% width) | Connect to the sternum’s top. |\n| **Sternum** | (50%, 50%) | 5% width, 80% height | Vertical, tapers slightly from top (manubrium) to bottom (body). |\n| **Ribs** | 12 pairs, spaced 4% vertically | Radius decreases from 70% (1st rib) to 40% (12th rib) | Curved arcs originating from the thoracic spine (not visible). |\n| **Heart** | (50%, 70%) | 50% width, 35% height | Oval, apex points left (65% width, 75% height). |\n| **Diaphragm** | (50%, 80%) | 70% width | Curve with peaks: Right (25%, 75%), Left (75%, 77%). |\n| **Pacemaker** | (75%, 20%) | 3% width, 2% height (oval) | Patient’s left (image right). |\n| **Port** | (25%, 20%) | 1.5% width, 1% height (oval) | Patient’s right (image left). |\n| **\"L\" Marker** | (95%, 2%) | 1% width, 2% height (rectangle) | Top right corner (patient’s left). |\n\n#### **Key Spatial Rules**\n- **Ribs**: 12 pairs, spaced 4% vertically. Upper ribs (1–5) more horizontal; lower ribs (6–12) more oblique.  \n- **Heart**: Overlaps lower lungs (50% cardiothoracic ratio, normal).  \n- **Diaphragm**: Separates chest (above) from abdomen (light gray below). Right peak higher than left.  \n- **Implants**: Both below clavicles (20% height). Pacemaker leads curve into the heart; port lead is short.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Functional/Diagnostic**: No artistic flourishes—focus on clarity for medical interpretation.  \n- **Contrast**: High (clear differentiation between dense/ radiolucent tissues).  \n- **Edges**: Slightly blurred (penumbra) in bones/heart (due to X-ray source), sharp in diaphragm/costophrenic angles.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **\"L\" Marker**:  \n  - **Shape**: Vertical rectangle (rounded corners optional) at (95%, 2%).  \n  - **Text**: White, uppercase \"L\" (sans-serif, centered).  \n  - **Purpose**: Indicates the **patient’s left** (image right).  \n- **Bronchovascular Markings**:  \n  - **Origin**: Hilum (center of each lung: Right (30%, 40%); Left (70%, 40%)).  \n  - **Lines**: 0.1% width, branching 2–3 times (each branch 50% shorter than the previous).  \n- **Costal Cartilages**:  \n  - **Location**: Connect ribs 1–7 to the sternum.  \n  - **Lines**: 0.2% width, light gray (visible in upper chest).  \n- **Aortic Arch**:  \n  - **Shape**: Slight bulge on the left heart border.  \n  - **Position**: (60%, 55%), 10% of heart width.  \n- **Costophrenic Angles**:  \n  - **Shape**: Sharp corners where diaphragm meets ribs.  \n  - **Position**: Right (15%, 80%); Left (85%, 80%).  \n\n\n### **6. Critical Geometric Details for SVG**\n- **Ribs**: Arcs with centers along an imaginary vertical line (thoracic spine) at (50%, 20%) (upper ribs) to (50%, 60%) (lower ribs).  \n- **Pacemaker Leads**: 2 thin lines (0.1% width) from the pacemaker (75%, 20%) to:  \n  - **Right Atrium**: (50%, 50%) (curves medially).  \n  - **Right Ventricle**: (50%, 65%) (curves inferiorly).  \n- **Port Lead**: 1 thin line (0.1% width) from the port (25%, 20%) to (50%, 45%) (medial curve).  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Recreation**\n- **Layers**: Separate layers for bones, heart, lungs, implants, marker, and noise.  \n- **Paths**: Use Bézier curves for ribs, diaphragm, and leads; rectangles for the sternum/marker; ovals for implants.  \n- **Textures**: Add subtle grain to lungs (using a noise filter) and porous texture to bones (using a pattern).  \n- **Contrast**: Ensure bones/heart are light gray/white, lungs are dark gray, and the background is black.  \n\nThis detailed breakdown provides the precision needed to recreate the image as a scalable SVG, preserving all diagnostic and geometric features.",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning\nThe composition uses **depth of field** to focus on the primary branch and birds, with the background blurred for emphasis. Key spatial rules:\n\n### Primary Branch\n- **Position**: Spans 90% of the image width (left edge to 90% right), centered vertically in the lower third (y = 60% of image height).  \n- **Curvature**: Gentle upward arc in the middle (peak at 50% length), then downward slope at the right end.  \n- **Secondary Branch**: Splits from the main branch at (x = 60%, y = 65%), curving downward to the right (ending at x = 75%, y = 85%).  \n\n### Birds (Perch Positions on Main Branch)\nMeasured as a percentage of the main branch’s length (left to right):  \n| Bird # | X-Position (Branch Length) | Y-Position (Relative to Branch) |\n|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1      | 10%                        | 0% (sitting flush)               |\n| 2      | 25%                        | +5% (slightly raised)            |\n| 3      | 40%                        | 0%                               |\n| 4      | 55%                        | +10% (raised for visibility)     |\n| 5      | 70%                        | +15% (tallest perch, most prominent) |\n| 6      | 85%                        | 0%                               |\n\n### Sizing (Relative to Male Cardinal)\n- Male Cardinal (100%): 5 cm tall (image scale: 1 cm = 200 SVG units).  \n- Female Cardinal (85%): 4.25 cm tall.  \n- Eastern Bluebird (75%): 3.75 cm tall.  \n- Tufted Titmouse (70%): 3.5 cm tall.  \n- Chickadee (65%): 3.25 cm tall.  \n- Female Bluebird (60%): 3 cm tall.  \n\n### Background\n- **Branches**: 2–3 thin paths crossing the background (e.g., one from top-left to middle-right, one from top-right to bottom-middle), overlapping the main branch slightly.  \n- **Blur**: Background elements (branches, gradient) have a 20–30% Gaussian blur to separate them from the in-focus foreground.  \n\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\nThe image uses a **naturalistic, photographic style** with soft lighting and shallow depth of field, optimized for SVG with:  \n- **Focus**: Sharp details on the primary branch and birds; background blurred to draw attention to the subjects.  \n- **Lighting**: Upper-left light source creating:  \n  - Bright highlights on the male cardinal’s crest/back and the bluebird’s wings.  \n  - Subtle shadows under the birds’ bodies and on the branch’s right edges.  \n- **Texture**:  \n  - **Birds**: Feathers rendered with subtle gradient layers (e.g., bluebird’s blue back fades to lighter blue at the edges).  \n  - **Branch**: Rough bark with 1–2 mm wide cracks (using dashed paths or texture patterns).  \n- **Color Palette**: Vibrant but muted (pastel greens, soft browns) with bold accents (male cardinal’s red, bluebird’s blue) for contrast.  \n\n\n## 5. Specific Details (Critical for SVG Accuracy)\n### Birds\n- **Eyes**: All birds have dark round eyes (1 mm diameter) with a 0.2 mm white highlight (upper-left quadrant).  \n- **Beaks**:  \n  - Male/Female Cardinal: Thick, cone-shaped red beaks (male’s is 1.5x larger than female’s).  \n  - Bluebirds/Titmouse/Chickadee: Thin, pointed black beaks (titmouse’s beak is slightly open).  \n- **Talons**: 3 forward-facing, 1 backward-facing black talons (0.5 mm long) gripping the branch; visible between the birds’ legs.  \n- **Crests**:  \n  - Male Cardinal: Tall (1.5 cm), pointed crest (3–4 feather \"spikes\").  \n  - Female Cardinal: Short (0.8 cm), rounded crest.  \n  - Titmouse: Prominent (1 cm), upright crest (2–3 feathers).  \n  - Chickadee: Stubby (0.5 cm) crest.  \n\n### Branch\n- **Knot**: 5 mm diameter circular knot at the secondary branch split (x = 60%, y = 65%), with a darker brown (0, 50, 90, 30 / #603010) center.  \n- **Leaves**: Small oval leaves (1–2 mm long) on the main branch:  \n  - Between bird 1–2: (x = 15%, y = 58%).  \n  - Between bird 2–3: (x = 30%, y = 58%).  \n  - Between bird 5–6: (x = 78%, y = 58%).  \n\n### Background\n- **Noise**: Subtle 5% gray noise added to the background gradient to mimic film grain.  \n- **Bokeh**: Soft, out-of-focus green \"dots\" (1–2 mm diameter) scattered in the upper right (simulates distant foliage).  \n\n\n## SVG Implementation Notes\nTo recreate the image accurately, use these SVG techniques:  \n- **Groups**: Organize birds as `<g>` elements (body, wings, tail, head, beak, eyes) for easy editing.  \n- **Filters**:  \n  - **Background**: Apply `feGaussianBlur(stdDeviation=\"5\")` to background branches/gradient.  \n  - **Feathers**: Use `feSpecularLighting` or gradient layers to simulate texture.  \n- **Gradients**:  \n  - **Birds**: Linear gradients for feathers (e.g., bluebird’s back: #0070FF to #0050CC).  \n  - **Branch**: Radial gradient for the knot (center: #603010, edge: #805020).  \n- **Paths**:  \n  - **Birds**: Use Bézier curves for smooth feather edges (e.g., cardinal’s crest, bluebird’s tail).  \n  - **Branch**: Rough edges created with `stroke-linecap=\"round\"` and irregular path points.  \n\nBy following these details, the SVG will retain the image’s naturalistic charm, depth, and focus on the perched birds—critical for an accurate reproduction.",
  "v1_86": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this autumnal still life, the following detailed description breaks down the image into **main objects, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details**, with a focus on geometric precision, proportions, and layout.\n\n\n### **1.

Rough, matte texture with subtle shadows between planks.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is diagonal, with wooden planks leading the eye from the bottom-left (foreground) to the top-right (background). Objects are grouped but not overcrowded, with intentional overlapping to create depth.  \n\n#### **Foreground**  \n- **Tomatoes**: Centered in the lower third, overlapping the front-left jar and leaves. The vine stems extend to the right, connecting all 6 tomatoes.  \n- **Leaves**: Scattered in the lower-left (2 large leaves) and lower-right (3 large leaves), overlapping the table and tomatoes.  \n\n#### **Middle Ground**  \n- **Jars**: Front-left jar (tallest) is positioned at the left edge, overlapping the background red container. Middle jar is to the right of the front-left jar, overlapping the dark blue jar.  \n- **Apples**: To the right of the middle jar, in a loose triangle: dark red apple (top), green apple (middle), pinkish-red apple (bottom). Overlap the middle jar and leaves.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- **Red Container**: Left edge, partially hidden by the front-left jar.  \n- **Dark Blue Jar**: Right of the middle jar, partially hidden by the apples.  \n\n#### **Depth Cues**  \n- **Overlap**: Tomatoes > Jars > Apples > Background containers.  \n- **Size**: Front objects (tomatoes, front-left jar) are larger than background objects (dark blue jar, red container).  \n- **Shadows**: Soft, gray shadows (**#808080**, 30% opacity) under all objects, cast toward the bottom-right (light source from top-left).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Genre**: Realistic still life with an autumnal theme.  \n- **Lighting**: Soft natural light (likely morning/afternoon) with gentle highlights on glass and fruit. No harsh shadows.  \n- **Composition**: Balanced, with a diagonal flow (wooden planks) and symmetrical grouping (tomatoes in center, apples on right).  \n- **Tone**: Warm and inviting, emphasizing harvest abundance.  \n\n\n### **5. Specific Details for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Water Droplets**: Small, irregular circles (1–3 pixels) on tomatoes and apples. Use a radial gradient (white center, transparent edge) to mimic shine.  \n- **Jar Lids**: Metal lids have a slight reflection (linear gradient: gold center, darker gold edge). The front-left jar’s label is a small rectangle (**#0000cd**) with a gold swirl pattern (**#ffd700**).  \n- **Leaves**: Serrated edges (use a path with 5–7 points per edge), pinnate veins (1 main vein + 4–5 side veins), and brown spots (irregular circles, **#8b4513**).  \n- **Wooden Planks**: Parallel lines (**#000000**, 1 pixel) between planks, with grain as thin, wavy lines (**#a0522d**) across each plank.  \n- **Shadows**: Soft, blurred rectangles (**#808080**, 30% opacity) under each object, slightly wider than the object’s base.  \n\n\n### **Key Proportions for SVG**\n- **Image Dimensions**: Assume a 1000px × 700px canvas (standard still life ratio).  \n- **Front-Left Jar**: 400px tall × 200px wide (diameter).  \n- **Tomatoes**: 150px diameter each.  \n- **Green Apple**: 175px diameter.  \n- **Leaves**: 200px long × 100px wide (largest leaves).  \n- **Wooden Planks**: 100px wide each, with 10px gaps between them.  \n\n\n### **Summary for SVG Creation**\nTo accurately recreate this image, prioritize:  \n- **Geometric Precision**: Cylindrical jars, spherical fruit, serrated leaves.  \n- **Color Accuracy**: Match the warm autumnal palette and material-specific hues (e.g., glass transparency, fruit shine).  \n- **Texture**: Use gradients (glass reflection), patterns (wood grain, leaf veins), and transparency (shadows, droplets).  \n- **Depth**: Overlap objects, adjust size for foreground/background, and add soft shadows.  \n- **Details**: Water droplets, jar labels, leaf spots, and wooden cracks are critical for realism.  \n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will capture the still life’s warmth, detail, and autumnal charm.",

Leather, highly embossed |\n\n---\n\n\n## **3. Spatial Relationships & Positioning**\n- **Books**: Tightly packed with minimal gaps; a few books (e.g., middle shelf, position 2) are slightly shorter and sit flush with taller neighbors.  \n- **Bookmarks**: Tassels hang vertically from the shelf edge, 1–2 cm long, with varying thread colors (white = cotton, blue = silk, red = wool).  \n- **Shelf Structure**: Vertical sides of the bookshelf are ~2 cm thick; shelves are ~1.5 cm thick, with a 1 cm overhang on the front.  \n- **Depth**: Books extend ~15 cm from the shelf back to the front (standard bookshelf depth).  \n\n\n## **4. Colors, Textures, & Visual Properties**\n### **Color Palette**  \n- **Dominant**: Reds (crimson, deep red), blacks (leather, matte), blues (navy, bright blue), greens (forest, olive).  \n- **Accents**: Yellows (gradient), purples (gradient), light blues (glossy).  \n- **Warm Tones**: Light brown (shelf), gold (text/symbols), yellow (tassel).  \n\n### **Textures**  \n- **Leather**: Most common (shiny, embossed, matte); e.g., top shelf position 1 (red leather), middle shelf position 1 (red leather).  \n- **Paper/Glossy**: Smooth, reflective; e.g., middle shelf position 3 (red *IL BIBBIA*), bottom shelf position 13 (light blue *ZAAWADI*).  \n- **Embossed**: Intricate patterns on leather; e.g., bottom shelf position 17 (crimson red *BIBLIA*).  \n- **Marbled**: Unique, textured; e.g., bottom shelf position 2 (green marbled).  \n\n### **Lighting**  \n- Soft, warm ambient light from the left, creating subtle shadows on the right edges of books.  \n- Shelf edges cast thin shadows (~0.5 cm) on the books below.  \n\n\n## **5. Style & Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism**: Highly detailed, with focus on texture (leather grain, embossing) and material authenticity.  \n- **Variety**: Intentional diversity in book designs (colors, symbols, fonts) to depict different editions/translations.  \n- **Warm Tone**: The light brown shelf and gold text create a cozy, nostalgic atmosphere.  \n- **Depth**: Books are slightly angled or overlapping (e.g., middle shelf position 1 leans on position 2) to add dimensionality.  \n\n\n## **6. Text, Symbols, & Specific Details**\n### **Text**  \n- **Languages**: Latin (e.g., *BIBLIA*), English (*Holy Bible*), German (*Bibel*), Croatian (*Sveto Pismo*), Maori (*Koha Maori*), etc.  \n- **Fonts**: Mostly serif (formal, classic) for titles; sans-serif for smaller text. Gold or white text is common on dark covers.  \n\n### **Symbols**  \n- **Crosses**: Multiple styles (simple white cross, gold cross, embossed cross) on Christian Bibles (e.g., top shelf position 3, middle shelf position 16).  \n- **Globes**: Gold globes on two *BIBLIAN* editions (top shelf positions 17–18), symbolizing global distribution.  \n- **Flowers**: Gold flowers on red *BIBLA* editions (top shelf position 8, middle shelf position 1), adding a decorative touch.  \n- **Geometric Patterns**: Intricate embossed patterns on the largest red *BIBLIA* (bottom shelf position 17), likely representing a traditional design.  \n\n### **Other Details**  \n- **Publisher Logos**: Small gold logos (e.g., a book on middle shelf position 10, a flower on top shelf position 8).  \n- **Year**: *1961* on a black Bible (middle shelf position 10), indicating the publication year.  \n- **Tassels**: Vary in length (1–2 cm) and material (cotton, silk); attached to the top of books and hang over the shelf edge.  \n\n\n## **7. SVG-Specific Notes for Reproduction**\n- **Shelf Structure**: Draw the bookshelf as a rectangular frame with three horizontal shelves. Use a light brown fill with a subtle wood grain texture (optional, but adds realism).  \n- **Books**: Each book is a rectangle with a front cover, spine, and (for some) a slightly angled top edge (to show depth). Use layer order to simulate overlapping (e.g., middle shelf position 1 is in front of position 2).  \n- **Text/Symbols**: Use vector text (serif fonts for titles) and vector shapes (crosses, globes) to ensure scalability. Gold text should have a subtle gradient (light gold to dark gold) for depth.  \n- **Textures**: For leather, use a subtle noise filter or gradient; for glossy covers, add a small highlight (white or light gray) in the top-left corner.  \n- **Tassels**: Draw as thin rectangles with a \"fringe\" at the bottom (use a path with multiple small lines for the tassel strands).  \n- **Lighting**: Add a soft white gradient to the top of the shelf and a subtle shadow below each shelf to simulate ambient light.  \n\nBy following this detailed breakdown, an SVG artist can accurately recreate the image with attention to both macro (shelf structure) and micro (book texture, text) elements. The key is to prioritize **proportionality** (relative book sizes) and **visual consistency** (color palettes, text styles) to match the original’s warm, nostalgic vibe.",
  "v1_88": "To create an accurate SVG recreation of this image, here is a detailed, structured description covering all critical elements, with a focus on geometric precision, spatial relationships, and visual properties:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a close-up of the **lower front section of a car**, centered on the license plate and surrounding components. Key objects include:  \n- **License Plate**: A rectangular metal plate (standard UK front plate dimensions: ~520mm wide × 111mm tall) with straight edges (no rounded corners).  \n- **License Plate Holder**: A recessed rectangular frame integrated into the car’s bumper, slightly larger than the license plate (adds ~10mm margin on all sides) to secure the plate flush with the bumper.  \n- **Bumper**: A curved, horizontal panel spanning the width of the image, forming the base of the car’s front end.  \n- **Grille**: A horizontal chrome panel above the bumper, featuring evenly spaced **parallel slats** (~15 slats, each ~5mm thick) and a **Volvo logo** (centered).  \n- **Ground**: A flat, rectangular section at the bottom of the image, representing an asphalt surface.  \n- **Screws**: Four small, circular metal screws (one at each corner of the license plate) securing it to the bumper.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Car Body (Bumper/Grille Area)**  \n- **Bumper**: Dark metallic navy blue (#001F3F or similar), with a **high-gloss finish** (reflective). The surface has subtle imperfections:  \n  - Fine white specks (dust/dirt) scattered across the bumper, concentrated near the license plate edges.  \n  - Faint horizontal scratches (1–2mm long) on the left/right sides of the plate holder.  \n- **Grille Slats**: Polished chrome (#E0E0E0 with a metallic gradient), shiny and reflective.  \n- **Volvo Logo**: Silver chrome (#C0C0C0), consisting of a circle (diameter ~40mm) with a stylized arrow (pointing right) intersecting the circle at the top.  \n\n#### **License Plate**  \n- **Background**: Flat black (#000000), matte finish.  \n- **Text**: White (#FFFFFF) embossed characters (raised ~1mm) in the **Charles Wright font** (standard for UK license plates).  \n- **Screws**: Silver (#808080), small circles (~5mm diameter) with a slightly recessed center.  \n\n#### **Ground**  \n- **Asphalt**: Medium gray (#808080) with a **rough, matte texture**.  \n- **Stains/Specks**: Dark gray (#404040) irregular spots (oil/dirt) scattered across the surface, concentrated in the center and bottom edges.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe image uses a **horizontal aspect ratio** (approx. 4:3, e.g., 800px wide × 600px tall). Key positioning:  \n- **License Plate**: Centered horizontally in the lower 1/3 of the image. Its top edge is aligned with the bottom of the grille, and its bottom edge is ~20mm above the ground.  \n- **Grille**: Spans the entire width of the image, occupying the top 1/4 of the frame. The Volvo logo is perfectly centered within the grille.  \n- **Bumper**: Extends from the left to right edges of the image, between the grille and the ground. The license plate holder is recessed into the bumper, creating a 3D effect.  \n- **Ground**: Occupies the bottom 1/5 of the image, with a slight gradient (darker at the bottom, lighter at the top) to simulate depth.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image is a **realistic photograph**, but the SVG should replicate it as a **vector illustration** with:  \n- **Gradients**: For glossy surfaces (bumper/grille). The bumper uses a radial gradient (dark navy at the center, lighter navy at the edges) to mimic light reflection. The grille slats use a linear gradient (chrome at the top, darker gray at the bottom) for depth.  \n- **Textures**:  \n  - **Bumper**: A subtle \"noise\" texture (1–2% opacity) to represent dust/specks.  \n  - **Ground**: A \"grain\" texture (5% opacity) to simulate asphalt roughness.  \n- **Lighting**:  \n  - **Bumper Reflections**: Small, white highlight dots (1–3mm diameter) on the left/right sides of the license plate holder, mimicking ambient light.  \n  - **Grille Reflections**: Faint horizontal white lines (aligned with the slats) to represent light bouncing off the chrome.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **License Plate Text**  \n- **Characters**: White embossed text on a black background, with the format **`S3302CD`** (7 characters total):  \n  - **Prefix**: `S` (1st character, letter).  \n  - **Numeric**: `3302` (2nd–5th characters, numbers).  \n  - **Suffix**: `CD` (6th–7th characters, letters).  \n- **Font Metrics**:  \n  - Character height: ~79mm (standard for UK plates).  \n  - Character width: Varies by character (e.g., `S` = ~50mm, `3` = ~45mm, `C` = ~50mm).  \n  - Spacing: No spaces between characters (compact layout).  \n\n#### **Volvo Logo**  \n- **Shape**: A circle (diameter ~40mm) with a stylized arrow (arrowhead pointing right, shaft extending from the circle’s left edge to the center).  \n- **Position**: Centered vertically/horizontally within the grille.  \n\n#### **Screws**  \n- **Position**: One screw at each corner of the license plate, aligned with the plate’s edges (10mm from each corner).  \n- **Style**: Flathead screws with a recessed slot (represented as a thin white line across the circle).  \n\n\n### **6. Critical Geometric/Layout Details for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these measurements and proportions (scaled to the image’s aspect ratio):  \n- **Grille Slats**:  \n  - Number of slats: 15 (evenly spaced).  \n  - Slat dimensions: ~5mm thick × 200mm long (varies by position, as the grille curves slightly).  \n  - Spacing between slats: ~10mm.  \n- **License Plate Holder**:  \n  - Margin around plate: 10mm (so holder dimensions = plate width + 20mm × plate height + 20mm).  \n- **Ground**:  \n  - Height: 1/5 of the image’s total height.  \n  - Gradient: Linear gradient from #808080 (top) to #404040 (bottom) to create depth.  \n- **Bumper Curvature**: A subtle horizontal curve (radius ~500mm) to mimic the car’s front shape.  \n\n\n### **7. Final Notes for Realism**\n- **Glossy Surfaces**: Use radial gradients on the bumper (dark center, light edges) and linear gradients on the grille (light top, dark bottom) to replicate reflections.  \n- **Dirt/Specks**: Add a \"noise\" filter (1–2% opacity) to the bumper and ground to simulate texture.  \n- **Lighting**: Place small white highlights on the bumper (left/right of the plate) and grille (top slats) to mimic ambient light.  \n\nBy incorporating these details, the SVG will accurately reproduce the image’s composition, texture, and visual style while maintaining the precision required for vector graphics.",

Textures range from smooth (sign) to rough (scaffolding).\n\n| **Element**               | **Fill Color**                          | **Texture/Effect**                                                                 |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Sky**                   | `#111111` (near-black)                  | Matte; small blue window (`#87CEEB`, `x=900, y=0, width=100, height=100`, `opacity=0.5`) |\n| **Building Wall**         | `#222222` (dark gray)                   | Matte, blending with sky                                                           |\n| **Store Sign Background** | `linear-gradient(#FFD700, #FFA500)`     | Smooth, glossy (gold to orange gradient for backlight effect)                     |\n| **Logo**                  | Outer circle: `#FFA500`; Dot: `#FFD700` | Inner circle cutout (`#222222`) creates a crescent (Hindu moon/star symbol)       |\n| **Text**                  | `#000000` (black)                       | Bold sans-serif (e.g., *Arial Bold*), tight letter spacing (`10px`)                |\n| **Scaffolding**           | `#333333` (dark gray)                   | Metallic gradient (`#444444` top → `#222222` bottom); rounded pipe ends (`border-radius=5px`) |\n| **Storefront Glass**      | `#FFFFCC` (pale yellow)                 | Slightly transparent (`opacity=0.8`) to show interior; subtle reflection          |\n| **Interior Elements**     | Counter: `#FFFF99`; People: `#666666`   | Counter: Matte; People: Rounded heads (`border-radius=5px`) for human silhouette   |\n| **Sign Glow**             | `#FFA500` (orange)                      | Gaussian blur (`radius=10px`), `opacity=0.5`; rectangle `x=10, y=190, width=980, height=170` (10px larger than sign) |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nElements are layered to create depth, with the sign as the focal point. Scaffolding in the foreground adds a \"work-in-progress\" vibe.\n\n| **Layer Order (Bottom → Top)** | **Element**               | **Position Relative to Canvas**                                                    |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 (Bottom)                    | Sky                       | Covers top 1/3 of canvas                                                          |\n| 2                              | Building Wall             | Behind the sign (y=200 to 400)                                                    |\n| 3                              | Sign Background           | Centered horizontally (x=20 to 980), y=200 to 350                                |\n| 4                              | Sign Glow                 | Halo around sign (10px buffer), blending with background                          |\n| 5                              | Logo                      | Left end of sign (center `x=75, y=275`), overlapping sign background              |\n| 6                              | Text                      | Right of logo (\"Luxmi\" starts at x=190; \"Jewellers\" at x=500), vertically centered |\n| 7 (Foreground)                | Scaffolding               | In front of sign/storefront; pipes span from sky (y=180) to bottom (y=600)        |\n| 8                              | Storefront Glass          | Below scaffolding (y=400 to 600), behind planks                                    |\n| 9                              | Interior Elements         | Behind glass (counter/people inside store)                                        |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image has a **gritty, documentary-style realism** with a focus on nighttime urban life. Key stylistic choices:\n- **High Contrast**: Glowing sign vs. dark surroundings draws attention to the store.\n- **Industrial Aesthetic**: Scaffolding adds texture and implies construction/renovation.\n- **Warm vs. Cool Tones**: Sign (warm orange/gold) contrasts with sky/scaffolding (cool grays), creating visual tension.\n- **Depth**: Layered elements (sky → sign → scaffolding → storefront) give a sense of space.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text**\n- **Content**: *\"Luxmi Jewellers\"* (spelled `L-U-X-M-I J-E-W-E-L-L-E-R-S`).  \n- **Font**: Bold sans-serif (e.g., *Helvetica Bold*), 70px size, letter spacing `10px`.  \n- **Position**: Vertically centered in the sign (baseline at `y=275`). \"Luxmi\" starts 50px right of the logo; \"Jewellers\" starts 100px right of \"Luxmi\" to balance spacing.\n\n#### **Logo**\n- **Symbol**: Hindu moon/star (crescent + dot), associated with the goddess Lakshmi (wealth/prosperity).  \n- **Geometry**:  \n  - Outer circle (`r=75px`) fills the left end of the sign.  \n  - Inner circle (`r=50px`, `cx=125px`) cuts out the right half of the outer circle, creating a crescent.  \n  - Dot (`r=10px`, `cy=225px`) sits above the crescent, centered horizontally.\n\n#### **Scaffolding**\n- **Structure**: 6 vertical pipes (evenly spaced: `x=20, 200, 400, 600, 800, 980`), connected by 3 horizontal pipes (`y=180, 280, 380`) and diagonal braces (e.g., `x=20,y=180` → `x=200,y=280`).  \n- **Planks**: 5 horizontal platforms (`y=300`, 180px wide) between pipes, where a dark silhouette (`x=500, y=300, width=30, height=50`) stands.\n\n#### **Storefront**\n- **Door**: Center panel (`x=250, y=400, width=500, height=200`) with a small handle (`x=300, y=500, width=5, height=10`, `#000000`).  \n- **Windows**: Left/right panels (`230px` wide) with subtle reflections (pale yellow fill + `opacity=0.8`).\n\n\n### **6. Key SVG-Specific Notes**\nTo recreate the image accurately, include these technical details:\n- **Layer Order**: Follow the spatial hierarchy (sky → building → sign → scaffolding → storefront → interior).  \n- **Clipping**: The logo’s crescent is created by clipping the outer circle with the inner circle (use `<clipPath>`).  \n- **Blur Effect**: The sign’s glow uses SVG’s `<filter id=\"glow\">` with `<feGaussianBlur>`.  \n- **Text Alignment**: Use `text-anchor=\"start\"` for \"Luxmi\" and \"Jewellers\" to maintain left-to-right flow.  \n- **Responsiveness**: Use relative units (e.g., `%`) for dimensions if scaling, but keep proportions consistent (sign width = 96% of canvas).\n\n\n### **Summary of Focal Points**\n- **Sign**: Glowing gradient background, bold text, and religious logo (central focus).  \n- **Scaffolding**: Industrial texture and human silhouette add context (work in progress).  \n- **Storefront**: Transparent glass and interior hints (people, counter) ground the scene in reality.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary geometric, color, and stylistic details to reproduce the image as a precise, scalable SVG.",
  "v1_9": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this gas station price sign, the following detailed breakdown of **main elements, colors, spatial relationships, style, and specific details** is provided. The description uses a **100x100 unit reference system** for proportional consistency, which can be scaled to any size.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a rectangular fuel price sign with a hierarchical layout of sections for different fuel types. Key elements include:  \n- **Header bar**: A top blue bar with white text (\"Gasoline\", \"Self Serve\").  \n- **Fuel type sections**: Three stacked red rectangles (for *Regular*, *Plus*, *Supreme* gasoline) and one green rectangle (for *Diesel No.2*), each containing:  \n  - Fuel type name (left-aligned white text).  \n  - Price display (right-aligned, with large seven-segment digits for the main price and a smaller fraction box for the 9/10 cent increment).  \n- **Borders**: Thin black borders separating all sections and the sign’s outer edge.  \n\n#### **Seven-Segment Digits**  \nThe main price (e.g., `3.49`) uses **standard seven-segment displays**, where each digit is composed of 7 rectangular segments (labeled `a` to `g`). For example:  \n- Digit `3` uses segments `a` (top), `b` (upper right), `g` (middle), `c` (lower right), `d` (bottom).  \n- The decimal point is a 1x1 unit white dot between the dollar and cent values.  \n\n#### **Fraction Box**  \nEach price includes a small square box (8 units wide × 10 units tall) to the right of the main digits, containing the stacked fraction `9/10` (white text on a colored background matching the section).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \nAll elements are **flat (no textures)** with solid colors, typical of industrial signage. Key color codes (hex values) and properties:  \n\n| Element | Color (Hex) | Description |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| Header bar background | `#003399` | Dark royal blue. |\n| Gasoline section backgrounds (Regular/Plus/Supreme) | `#CC0000` | Dark red. |\n| Diesel section background | `#006600` | Dark green. |\n| Borders (all sections/outer edge) | `#000000` | 1-unit thick black borders. |\n| Text (all) | `#FFFFFF` | Bold sans-serif, white. |\n| Seven-segment digits/decimal point | `#FFFFFF` | Solid white, flat. |\n| Fraction box text (`9/10`) | `#FFFFFF` | Bold sans-serif, white. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe sign is divided into **contiguous sections** with 1-unit black borders separating them. The layout (using the 100x100 reference) is:  \n\n#### **Header Bar (Top Section)**  \n- **Dimensions**: 0–100 units wide (full width), 0–20 units tall (20% of total height).  \n- **Text Positioning**:  \n  - `\"Gasoline\"`: Left-aligned, 5 units from the left edge, vertically centered (5 units from the top).  \n  - `\"Self Serve\"`: Right-aligned, 5 units from the right edge, vertically centered.  \n\n#### **Gasoline Sections (Regular/Plus/Supreme)**  \nThree identical red sections stacked vertically below the header. Each:  \n- **Dimensions**: 0–100 units wide, 16 units tall (e.g., Regular = 21–37 units tall; Plus = 38–54; Supreme = 55–71).  \n- **Fuel Type Name**: Left-aligned, 5 units from the left edge, vertically centered in the section (e.g., Regular = 29 units tall).  \n- **Price Display**:  \n  - **Main Digits**: Seven-segment display (e.g., `3.49`) right-aligned in a 40-unit wide area (50–90 units from the left). The digits are 10 units tall (matching the section’s inner height).  \n  - **Fraction Box**: 8 units wide × 10 units tall (91–99 units from the left), containing the stacked fraction `9/10` (centered).  \n\n#### **Diesel Section**  \nA green rectangle below the gasoline sections, identical in layout to the red sections but with:  \n- **Fuel Type Name**: `\"Diesel No.2\"` (left-aligned, 5 units from the left).  \n- **Price Display**: Seven-segment digits for `3.60` (right-aligned) and a green fraction box with `9/10`.  \n\n#### **Borders**  \nAll sections (header, gasoline, diesel) have a **1-unit thick black border** surrounding their inner area. For example:  \n- The header bar’s inner blue area is 1–99 units wide × 1–19 units tall (border: 0–100w × 0–20h).  \n\n\n### **3.1 Proportional Summary (100x100 Reference)**  \n| Element | Dimensions (W×H) | Position (X×Y) |\n|---------|------------------|----------------|\n| Header Bar (outer) | 100×20 | 0×0 |\n| Header Bar (inner) | 98×18 | 1×1 |\n| Regular Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×21 |\n| Regular Section (inner) | 98×14 | 1×22 |\n| Plus Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×38 |\n| Supreme Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×55 |\n| Diesel Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×72 |\n| Main Price Digits (e.g., `3.49`) | 31×10 | 59×22 |\n| Fraction Box (e.g., `9/10`) | 8×10 | 91×22 |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Flat Design**: No gradients or textures—all elements use solid colors, typical of industrial signage for readability.  \n- **Bold Sans-Serif Text**: All text (headers, fuel types, fractions) uses a bold sans-serif font (e.g., Arial Bold) for high visibility.  \n- **Hierarchical Layout**: The header bar (top) and stacked fuel sections (bottom) create a clear visual hierarchy, guiding the viewer from general (gasoline/self-serve) to specific (fuel types/prices).  \n- **High Contrast**: White text/numbers on dark colored backgrounds (blue, red, green) ensures maximum legibility in bright outdoor conditions.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n#### **Text**  \n| Element | Text | Font | Size (Units) | Color | Position |\n|---------|------|------|--------------|-------|----------|\n| Header | `\"Gasoline\"` | Bold sans-serif (e.g., Arial Bold) | 5 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (header bar) |\n| Header | `\"Self Serve\"` | Bold sans-serif | 5 | White | Right-aligned, 5 units from right (header bar) |\n| Fuel Type (Regular) | `\"Regular\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Regular section) |\n| Fuel Type (Plus) | `\"Plus\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Plus section) |\n| Fuel Type (Supreme) | `\"Supreme\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Supreme section) |\n| Fuel Type (Diesel) | `\"Diesel No.2\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Diesel section) |\n| Fraction | `\"9/10\"` (stacked) | Bold sans-serif | 3 | White | Centered in fraction box |\n\n#### **Seven-Segment Digits**  \nEach digit is 6 units wide × 10 units tall, with 1-unit thick segments. The segments are labeled `a` (top) to `g` (middle), and only the required segments are \"lit\" (white) for each digit. For example:  \n- Digit `3`: Segments `a`, `b`, `g`, `c`, `d` (top, upper right, middle, lower right, bottom).  \n- Digit `6`: Segments `a`, `f`, `g`, `c`, `d`, `e` (top, upper left, middle, lower right, bottom, lower left).  \n\n#### **Fraction Box**  \nThe `9/10` fraction is **stacked** (9 above 10) with a horizontal line between them. The box is:  \n- 8 units wide × 10 units tall (matching the main digits’ height).  \n- Centered vertically in the section (e.g., 22–32 units tall for Regular).  \n- The \"9\" is 3 units tall, the \"10\" is 3 units tall, and the line is 1 unit tall (total 7 units, centered in the 10-unit height).  \n\n#### **Decimal Point**  \nA 1×1 unit white dot between the dollar and cent values (e.g., `3.49` has a dot at the midpoint of the 3 and 4).  \n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Notes for Accuracy**  \n- **Seven-Segment Digits**: Use `<rect>` elements for each segment (e.g., segment `a` is a 6×1 rectangle at the top of the digit). Group segments by digit and toggle visibility (fill color) based on the digit.  \n- **Borders**: Use `<rect>` elements with a black fill for borders, layered behind the inner section colors.  \n- **Text**: Use `<text>` elements with `font-family=\"Arial Bold\"`, `font-weight=\"bold\"`, and `fill=\"#FFFFFF\"`. For the stacked fraction `9/10`, use a `<g>` element to group the \"9\", horizontal line, and \"10\" (centered in the box).  \n- **Scaling**: The 100x100 reference can be scaled by a factor (e.g., ×10 for a 1000x1000 SVG) while preserving proportions.  \n\n#### **Example SVG Code Snippet (Header Bar)**  \n```xml\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#000000\" /> <!-- Border -->\n<rect x=\"1\" y=\"1\" width=\"98\" height=\"18\" fill=\"#003399\" /> <!-- Inner Blue -->\n<text x=\"5\" y=\"10\" font-family=\"Arial Bold\" font-size=\"5\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\">Gasoline</text>\n<text x=\"95\" y=\"10\" font-family=\"Arial Bold\" font-size=\"5\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">Self Serve</text>\n```\n\n\n### **Final Checklist for SVG**  \n- [ ] All sections have 1-unit black borders.  \n- [ ] Seven-segment digits use correct segment combinations (e.g., `3` has segments `a`, `b`, `g`, `c`, `d`).  \n- [ ] Fraction boxes are centered and contain stacked `9/10` text.  \n- [ ] Text is bold sans-serif, white, and aligned as described.  \n- [ ] Colors match the hex codes provided.  \n- [ ] Proportions are consistent with the 100x100 reference.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the sign with pixel-perfect accuracy in SVG, including geometric constraints, color values, and layout logic.",

Each:  \n- **Dimensions**: 0–100 units wide, 16 units tall (e.g., Regular = 21–37 units tall; Plus = 38–54; Supreme = 55–71).  \n- **Fuel Type Name**: Left-aligned, 5 units from the left edge, vertically centered in the section (e.g., Regular = 29 units tall).  \n- **Price Display**:  \n  - **Main Digits**: Seven-segment display (e.g., `3.49`) right-aligned in a 40-unit wide area (50–90 units from the left). The digits are 10 units tall (matching the section’s inner height).  \n  - **Fraction Box**: 8 units wide × 10 units tall (91–99 units from the left), containing the stacked fraction `9/10` (centered).  \n\n#### **Diesel Section**  \nA green rectangle below the gasoline sections, identical in layout to the red sections but with:  \n- **Fuel Type Name**: `\"Diesel No.2\"` (left-aligned, 5 units from the left).  \n- **Price Display**: Seven-segment digits for `3.60` (right-aligned) and a green fraction box with `9/10`.  \n\n#### **Borders**  \nAll sections (header, gasoline, diesel) have a **1-unit thick black border** surrounding their inner area. For example:  \n- The header bar’s inner blue area is 1–99 units wide × 1–19 units tall (border: 0–100w × 0–20h).  \n\n\n### **3.1 Proportional Summary (100x100 Reference)**  \n| Element | Dimensions (W×H) | Position (X×Y) |\n|---------|------------------|----------------|\n| Header Bar (outer) | 100×20 | 0×0 |\n| Header Bar (inner) | 98×18 | 1×1 |\n| Regular Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×21 |\n| Regular Section (inner) | 98×14 | 1×22 |\n| Plus Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×38 |\n| Supreme Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×55 |\n| Diesel Section (outer) | 100×16 | 0×72 |\n| Main Price Digits (e.g., `3.49`) | 31×10 | 59×22 |\n| Fraction Box (e.g., `9/10`) | 8×10 | 91×22 |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Flat Design**: No gradients or textures—all elements use solid colors, typical of industrial signage for readability.  \n- **Bold Sans-Serif Text**: All text (headers, fuel types, fractions) uses a bold sans-serif font (e.g., Arial Bold) for high visibility.  \n- **Hierarchical Layout**: The header bar (top) and stacked fuel sections (bottom) create a clear visual hierarchy, guiding the viewer from general (gasoline/self-serve) to specific (fuel types/prices).  \n- **High Contrast**: White text/numbers on dark colored backgrounds (blue, red, green) ensures maximum legibility in bright outdoor conditions.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n#### **Text**  \n| Element | Text | Font | Size (Units) | Color | Position |\n|---------|------|------|--------------|-------|----------|\n| Header | `\"Gasoline\"` | Bold sans-serif (e.g., Arial Bold) | 5 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (header bar) |\n| Header | `\"Self Serve\"` | Bold sans-serif | 5 | White | Right-aligned, 5 units from right (header bar) |\n| Fuel Type (Regular) | `\"Regular\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Regular section) |\n| Fuel Type (Plus) | `\"Plus\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Plus section) |\n| Fuel Type (Supreme) | `\"Supreme\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Supreme section) |\n| Fuel Type (Diesel) | `\"Diesel No.2\"` | Bold sans-serif | 4 | White | Left-aligned, 5 units from left (Diesel section) |\n| Fraction | `\"9/10\"` (stacked) | Bold sans-serif | 3 | White | Centered in fraction box |\n\n#### **Seven-Segment Digits**  \nEach digit is 6 units wide × 10 units tall, with 1-unit thick segments. The segments are labeled `a` (top) to `g` (middle), and only the required segments are \"lit\" (white) for each digit. For example:  \n- Digit `3`: Segments `a`, `b`, `g`, `c`, `d` (top, upper right, middle, lower right, bottom).  \n- Digit `6`: Segments `a`, `f`, `g`, `c`, `d`, `e` (top, upper left, middle, lower right, bottom, lower left).  \n\n#### **Fraction Box**  \nThe `9/10` fraction is **stacked** (9 above 10) with a horizontal line between them. The box is:  \n- 8 units wide × 10 units tall (matching the main digits’ height).  \n- Centered vertically in the section (e.g., 22–32 units tall for Regular).  \n- The \"9\" is 3 units tall, the \"10\" is 3 units tall, and the line is 1 unit tall (total 7 units, centered in the 10-unit height).  \n\n#### **Decimal Point**  \nA 1×1 unit white dot between the dollar and cent values (e.g., `3.49` has a dot at the midpoint of the 3 and 4).  \n\n\n### **6. SVG-Specific Notes for Accuracy**  \n- **Seven-Segment Digits**: Use `<rect>` elements for each segment (e.g., segment `a` is a 6×1 rectangle at the top of the digit). Group segments by digit and toggle visibility (fill color) based on the digit.  \n- **Borders**: Use `<rect>` elements with a black fill for borders, layered behind the inner section colors.  \n- **Text**: Use `<text>` elements with `font-family=\"Arial Bold\"`, `font-weight=\"bold\"`, and `fill=\"#FFFFFF\"`. For the stacked fraction `9/10`, use a `<g>` element to group the \"9\", horizontal line, and \"10\" (centered in the box).  \n- **Scaling**: The 100x100 reference can be scaled by a factor (e.g., ×10 for a 1000x1000 SVG) while preserving proportions.  \n\n#### **Example SVG Code Snippet (Header Bar)**  \n```xml\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"20\" fill=\"#000000\" /> <!-- Border -->\n<rect x=\"1\" y=\"1\" width=\"98\" height=\"18\" fill=\"#003399\" /> <!-- Inner Blue -->\n<text x=\"5\" y=\"10\" font-family=\"Arial Bold\" font-size=\"5\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\">Gasoline</text>\n<text x=\"95\" y=\"10\" font-family=\"Arial Bold\" font-size=\"5\" fill=\"#FFFFFF\" text-anchor=\"end\">Self Serve</text>\n```\n\n\n### **Final Checklist for SVG**  \n- [ ] All sections have 1-unit black borders.  \n- [ ] Seven-segment digits use correct segment combinations (e.g., `3` has segments `a`, `b`, `g`, `c`, `d`).  \n- [ ] Fraction boxes are centered and contain stacked `9/10` text.  \n- [ ] Text is bold sans-serif, white, and aligned as described.  \n- [ ] Colors match the hex codes provided.  \n- [ ] Proportions are consistent with the 100x100 reference.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the sign with pixel-perfect accuracy in SVG, including geometric constraints, color values, and layout logic.",
  "v1_90": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, below is a detailed, structured description covering all critical elements—from frame geometry to text styling and decorative details. The image is a **square, framed Christmas-themed design** with a vintage/retro aesthetic, featuring a mix of serif and cursive text, holly foliage, and decorative swirls.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe composition is centered around a **dark-framed square panel** (inner artwork) with the following key elements:  \n- **Frame**: A thick, layered rectangular border surrounding the inner panel.  \n- **Inner Panel**: A solid black square (the \"canvas\") containing:  \n  - **Text**: The phrase *\"HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS\"* in a mix of uppercase serif and lowercase cursive fonts.  \n  - **Decorative Foliage**: Holly clusters (leaves + berries) and small branches with berries/leaves.  \n  - **Ornamental Swirls/Flourishes**: Symmetrical curvilinear designs on the left/right edges and between text lines.  \n\n\n#### **Frame Details**\nThe frame is a **3-tiered rectangular border** with a recessed, shadowed effect. From outer to inner:  \n- **Outer Frame**: A thick (≈10% of total image width/height) dark gray/black border with a glossy finish.  \n- **Middle Frame**: A thinner (≈5% of total width/height) medium gray border, creating a \"step\" inward.  \n- **Inner Frame**: A very thin (≈2% of total width/height) light gray border, defining the edge of the inner panel.  \n\nThe frame is **square** (equal width/height), with the inner panel occupying ≈80% of the total image area.\n\n\n#### **Inner Panel (Black Background)**\nAll elements on the inner panel are **centered horizontally** and arranged in a vertical stack. Key objects:  \n\n| Element | Type | Description |\n|---------|------|-------------|\n| **Text** | Mixed fonts | *\"HAVE\"* (uppercase serif), *\"yourself\"* (lowercase cursive), *\"A\"* (uppercase serif), *\"MERRY\"* (uppercase serif), *\"LITTLE\"* (uppercase serif), *\"Christmas\"* (lowercase cursive). |\n| **Holly Clusters** | Foliage | Two clusters (top-right, bottom-right) with 2 green leaves + 3 red berries each. |\n| **Small Branches** | Foliage | Two branches: left of *\"yourself\"* (5 red berries + 2 leaves) and bottom-left of *\"Christmas\"* (2 leaves). |\n| **Swirls** | Ornament | Symmetrical vertical \"S-curve\" swirls on the left/right edges (main swirls) + smaller bottom swirls. |\n| **Flourishes** | Ornament | Small curved lines between *\"yourself\"*/*\"A\"* and *\"A\"*/*\"MERRY\"*. |\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Frame Colors**\n- Outer Frame: #1a1a1a (dark gray/black, glossy).  \n- Middle Frame: #2d2d2d (medium gray, matte).  \n- Inner Frame: #404040 (light gray, matte).  \n\n#### **Inner Panel Colors**\n- Background: #000000 (solid black, matte).  \n- **Text Colors**:  \n  - Serif fonts (*\"HAVE\", \"A\", \"MERRY\", \"LITTLE\"*): #f0e6d2 (pale gold/cream) with a subtle metallic gradient (lighter center, darker edges) for depth.  \n  - Cursive fonts (*\"yourself\", \"Christmas\"*): Same #f0e6d2 as serif text, but with a more fluid, hand-drawn texture.  \n- **Foliage Colors**:  \n  - Holly Leaves/Branches: #006400 (dark green, matte) with faint vein details (3 veins per leaf).  \n  - Berries: #ff0000 (bright red, glossy, round).  \n- **Swirls/Flourishes**: #f0e6d2 (same as text, matte).  \n\n#### **Textures**\n- Frame: Glossy (simulates polished wood/plastic).  \n- Inner Panel: Matte (flat black \"canvas\").  \n- Text/Foliage/Swirls: Slight metallic sheen on text (subtle gradient), matte on foliage/swirls.  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe inner panel is a **square** (1:1 aspect ratio), with all elements aligned **horizontally centered** and spaced vertically for balance. Below is a breakdown of vertical positioning (from top to bottom of the inner panel):  \n\n| Element | Vertical Position (Relative to Inner Panel Height) | Horizontal Alignment |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **\"HAVE\"** | Top 10% (baseline at 10% from top) | Centered |\n| **Top-Right Holly Cluster** | Overlaps the top-right corner of \"HAVE\" (baseline at 12% from top) | Right of \"HAVE\" |\n| **\"yourself\"** | Below \"HAVE\" (baseline at 25% from top) | Centered |\n| **Left Branch (Berries/Leaves)** | Overlaps the left edge of \"yourself\" (baseline at 28% from top) | Left of \"yourself\" |\n| **Small Flourishes** | Between \"yourself\" and \"A\" (baseline at 35% from top) | Centered |\n| **\"A\"** | Below \"yourself\" (baseline at 40% from top) | Centered |\n| **Large Swirl Flourish** | Between \"A\" and \"MERRY\" (baseline at 47% from top) | Centered |\n| **\"MERRY\"** | Below \"A\" (baseline at 55% from top) | Centered |\n| **Bottom-Right Holly Cluster** | Overlaps the bottom-right corner of \"MERRY\" (baseline at 62% from top) | Right of \"MERRY\" |\n| **\"LITTLE\"** | Below \"MERRY\" (baseline at 70% from top) | Centered |\n| **\"Christmas\"** | Below \"LITTLE\" (baseline at 85% from top) | Centered |\n| **Bottom-Left Branch (Leaves)** | Overlaps the bottom-left corner of \"Christmas\" (baseline at 88% from top) | Left of \"Christmas\" |\n\n#### **Key Spatial Rules**\n- **Text Spacing**: Consistent vertical gaps between lines (≈5% of inner panel height) to avoid overcrowding.  \n- **Foliage Placement**: Holly clusters/branches fill \"empty\" spaces (e.g., top-right of \"HAVE\", bottom-right of \"MERRY\") and overlap text slightly for depth.  \n- **Swirl Symmetry**: Left/right swirls are **mirror images** (left swirl curves inward from top-left; right swirl curves inward from top-right).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe design leans into a **vintage 1950s-1960s Christmas card aesthetic** with:  \n- **Font Mix**: Contrast between bold, structured serif fonts (*\"HAVE\", \"MERRY\"*) and flowing, cursive fonts (*\"yourself\", \"Christmas\"*) adds warmth and visual interest.  \n- **Color Palette**: Dark frame + black background create high contrast with light gold/cream text and bright red/green foliage (classic Christmas colors).  \n- **Textures**: Glossy frame vs. matte inner panel + metallic text sheen simulate a \"handmade\" or \"printed\" retro look.  \n- **Balance**: Symmetrical swirls and foliage (left/right) keep the composition balanced, while the cursive text adds movement.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Text Breakdown**\nThe phrase is split into 6 text elements, each with unique font styles and proportions:  \n\n| Text | Font Style | Font Size (Relative to Inner Panel Height) | Proportions (Width:Height) | Key Details |\n|------|------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|\n| **\"HAVE\"** | Uppercase serif (thick strokes, slight serifs) | 10% | 1.5:1 (wide) | Each letter is equally spaced; \"H\" and \"E\" have slightly rounded serifs. |\n| **\"yourself\"** | Lowercase cursive (flowing, looped) | 15% | 1:2 (tall) | Loops on \"y\", \"o\", \"u\", \"r\", \"s\", \"e\", \"l\", \"f\"; connecting strokes between letters. |\n| **\"A\"** | Uppercase serif (compact, bold) | 5% | 1:1 (square) | Centered between \"yourself\" and \"MERRY\"; thick vertical stroke with a curved top serif. |\n| **\"MERRY\"** | Uppercase serif (extra-bold, wide) | 20% | 2:1 (very wide) | Largest text element; \"M\" has a diagonal stroke, \"E\" has a rounded middle bar. |\n| **\"LITTLE\"** | Uppercase serif (medium-bold) | 8% | 1.5:1 (wide) | Compact; \"L\" has a long vertical stroke, \"T\" has a curved top serif. |\n| **\"Christmas\"** | Lowercase cursive (similar to \"yourself\") | 15% | 1:2 (tall) | Loops on \"C\", \"h\", \"r\", \"i\", \"s\", \"t\", \"m\", \"a\", \"s\"; connecting strokes between letters. |\n\n#### **Decorative Foliage Details**\n- **Holly Clusters** (2 total: top-right, bottom-right):  \n  - **Leaves**: 2 per cluster, oval with pointed tips, 3 veins per leaf (pale green veins on dark green leaves).  \n  - **Berries**: 3 per cluster, round, glossy red, arranged in a triangle (1 top, 2 bottom).  \n- **Small Branches** (2 total: left of \"yourself\", bottom-left of \"Christmas\"):  \n  - **Left Branch (Berries)**: 5 red berries (clustered) on a thin green stem + 2 leaves (1 long, 1 short).  \n  - **Bottom-left Branch (Leaves)**: 2 leaves (1 long, 1 short) on a thin green stem (no berries).  \n\n#### **Ornamental Swirls/Flourishes**\n- **Left/Right Swirls**: Mirror-image vertical \"S-curves\" on the left/right edges of the inner panel. Each swirl is a single continuous line (≈2% of inner panel width in thickness) with:  \n  - A large top curve (inward from the frame) and a smaller bottom curve (inward toward the text).  \n  - Slight thickening at curve peaks to simulate a hand-drawn look.  \n- **Between \"yourself\" and \"A\"**: 2 small, symmetric flourishes (≈1% of inner panel height). Each is a curved line with a serif at the end, facing each other (like two parentheses).  \n- **Between \"A\" and \"MERRY\"**: 1 large swirl (≈3% of inner panel height) with a loop at the end (resembles a comma but larger).  \n\n\n### **Critical SVG Reproduction Notes**\n- **Frame**: Use nested `<rect>` elements with different grays to create the layered, recessed effect. Add a `filter: drop-shadow()` to the inner frame for depth.  \n- **Inner Panel**: A single `<rect>` (100% width/height of the inner frame) filled with `#000000`.  \n- **Text**: Convert all text to `<path>` elements (since SVG requires vectorized text for accuracy). Use the color `#f0e6d2` with a `linearGradient` (light center to dark edges) for the metallic sheen.  \n- **Foliage**:  \n  - **Leaves**: Draw as `<path>` elements with vein details (use `<line>` or `<path>` for veins).  \n  - **Berries**: Draw as `<circle>` elements with a `fill: #ff0000` and `stroke: #000000` (thin black outline) for definition.  \n- **Swirls/Flourishes**: Use `<path>` elements with a `stroke: #f0e6d2` and `stroke-width: 2%` (relative to inner panel width). Ensure left/right swirls are mirror images (use `transform: scaleX(-1)` for the right swirl).  \n\n- **Alignment**: Use `text-anchor=\"middle\"` for all text and `transform=\"translate()\"` for precise positioning.  \n- **Proportions**: Maintain the 1:1 aspect ratio for the inner panel and frame. Use relative units (e.g., `%` or `vw`/`vh`) to ensure scalability.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key Measurements (For SVG)**\n- **Total Image**: 100% width/height (square).  \n- **Frame**:  \n  - Outer Frame: 10% of total width/height (e.g., 10px if total image is 100px).  \n  - Middle Frame: 5% of total width/height (inside outer frame).  \n  - Inner Frame: 2% of total width/height (inside middle frame).  \n- **Inner Panel**: 83% of total width/height (inside inner frame).  \n- **Text Sizes**: As a percentage of inner panel height:  \n  - \"HAVE\": 10%  \n  - \"yourself\": 15%  \n  - \"A\": 5%  \n  - \"MERRY\": 20%  \n  - \"LITTLE\": 8%  \n  - \"Christmas\": 15%  \n\nBy following these details, you can recreate an accurate SVG of the image with the correct layout, style, and visual hierarchy.",
  "v1_91": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we’ll break down the composition into **core elements**, **geometric details**, **color values**, **spatial relationships**, and **style guidelines**.

(gear), Power (power symbol).  \n\n### **Key Details**\n- **Joy-Con Texture**: Matte finish (represented by flat colors, no gradients).  \n- **Analog Sticks**: Slightly raised (use a 40px circle with a 5px inner circle for grip).  \n- **Screen Bezel**: Thin black border (16px) around the screen.  \n- **Game Icons**: Simplified vector versions of the cover art (e.g., Mario Kart’s vibrant characters, Zelda’s muted mountain scene).  \n\n\n## **SVG Reproduction Guidelines**\nTo ensure accuracy, follow these rules:  \n1. **Vector Shapes**: Use `rect` (rounded corners), `circle`, and `path` elements for all objects.  \n2. **Layers**: Organize elements in a logical stack (background → shadow → console → screen content → Joy-Con buttons).  \n3. **Text**: Use sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial) for all screen text, matching the Switch’s UI.  \n4. **Icons**: Recreate navigation/game icons as simple vectors (avoid bitmaps).  \n5. **Shadow**: Use a `rect` with `rx=\"10\"` (rounded corners) and `opacity=\"0.2\"`.  \n\nBy adhering to these details, the SVG will accurately reflect the original image’s composition, style, and brand identity.\n\n\n**Final SVG Structure

Adjustments to icon details (e.g., game cover art) can be made using more complex `path` elements or embedded images, but the above provides a foundation for a faithful reproduction.",
  "v1_92": "To create an accurate SVG reproduction of this image, the following detailed description breaks down the composition, elements, and visual properties with geometric precision, typographic specifics, and spatial relationships:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe primary subject is an **open, aged book** (likely a 17th/18th-century edition of Shakespeare’s works) positioned at a dramatic angle. The book dominates the frame, with two visible pages:  \n- **Front Page (Right Page)**: The focal point, featuring a **title block** and a **detailed engraving of William Shakespeare**.  \n- **Folded Left Page**: A partially visible, curled page overlapping the front page’s left edge, with faint text on its inner surface.  \n- **Spine**: A thin, vertical strip connecting the two pages, located on the far left of the image.  \n\n#### Key Subelements:\n- **Title Block**: A rectangular area at the top of the front page, framed by thin red border lines. Contains hierarchical text (see Section 5).  \n- **Portrait Frame**: A rectangular engraving of Shakespeare,占据 (occupying) the lower right ⅔ of the front page, bordered by a red line.  \n- **Background**: A soft, out-of-focus \"bokeh\" of muted colors (likely a museum display case), serving as a neutral backdrop.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nThe palette is dominated by **vintage, aged tones** with high contrast between the book’s sharp details and the blurred background.  \n\n| Element | Color/Texture | Details |\n|---------|---------------|---------|\n| **Paper (Pages/Spine)** | Aged beige (#f0e6d6) with subtle yellowing | Rough, textured surface (simulate with a subtle grain pattern in SVG). Slight \"foxing\" (age spots): small, irregular light brown (#d4af37) spots (1–5px) scattered sparsely across both pages. |\n| **Red Borders** | Brick red (#8b0000) | Thin (1–2px) lines framing the title block and portrait. |\n| **Text** | Black (#000000) | Classic serif fonts (see Section 5). |\n| **Engraving (Portrait)** | Grayscale (shades of #333333 to #ffffff) | Cross-hatching for shading; darker tones in hair/clothing, lighter tones in facial features. |\n| **Background** | Muted, desaturated blend of #8b4513 (brown), #a52a2a (red), and #d3d3d3 (gray) | Soft focus (bokeh effect) with no sharp edges. |\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe book is angled at **~45° from the horizontal**, with the front page’s top edge sweeping from the **top-right corner of the image** to the **middle-left third**. This creates a dynamic, diagonal composition that draws the eye to the portrait.  \n\n#### Page Dimensions (Relative to Image):\nAssume the image is 1000px wide × 600px tall (standard aspect ratio for the original photo).  \n- **Front Page**: 850px wide × 550px tall (occupies 85% of the image width, 92% of height). Positioned such that its top-right corner is at (950, 20) and bottom-left corner at (100, 580).  \n- **Folded Left Page**: 400px wide × 500px tall. Curled along its right edge, overlapping the front page’s left 150px. Its top edge starts at (50, 250) and curves to (200, 500).  \n- **Spine**: 20px wide × 550px tall. Runs vertically along the left edge of the front page, connecting to the folded left page.  \n\n#### Portrait Placement:\nThe engraving is a **500px wide × 400px tall rectangle** (60% of front page width, 73% of height) positioned in the **lower-right quadrant** of the front page. Its top-left corner is at (350, 150), bottom-right at (850, 550). A 1px red border frames the engraving, offset 10px from its edges.  \n\n#### Title Block Placement:\nThe title text is centered in a **600px wide × 120px tall rectangle** at the **top of the front page**. The red border lines frame this area:  \n- **Top Border**: Runs horizontally from (250, 80) to (750, 80).  \n- **Bottom Border**: Curves slightly (to follow the book’s angle) from (200, 200) to (800, 120).  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe image blends **photographic realism** (bokeh background, lighting) with **vintage print aesthetics** (aged paper, engraving, classic typography). Key style notes:  \n\n#### Aged Paper:\n- **Texture**: Subtle \"paper grain\" (1px × 1px noise pattern, 10% opacity) to simulate roughness.  \n- **Color Gradient**: Light beige (#f0e6d6) at the top-right (where light hits) fading to darker beige (#d2b48c) at the bottom-left (shadow), mimicking a top-right light source.  \n\n#### Engraving Style:\nThe Shakespeare portrait uses **cross-hatching** (parallel lines intersecting at 45°) for shading:  \n- **Dark Areas** (hair, clothing): Dense, closely spaced lines (#333333).  \n- **Light Areas** (forehead, cheeks): Sparse, widely spaced lines (#cccccc).  \n- **Ruff Collar**: Parallel vertical lines (#666666) to define folds.  \n- **Clothing**: Intricate geometric patterns (chevron/scroll motifs) in the chest area, rendered with thin, curved lines.  \n\n#### Lighting and Shadow:\n- **Front Page Highlight**: A soft, radial gradient (#ffffff, 10% opacity) at the top-right corner (light source).  \n- **Folded Page Shadow**: A 50px-wide blur (#000000, 20% opacity) under the left page, casting onto the front page.  \n- **Engraving Depth**: Subtle drop shadow (#000000, 15% opacity) under the portrait’s border to simulate embossing.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThe text is **hierarchically structured** with classic serif fonts, matching 17th-century print design. All text follows the book’s 45° angle (rotated -15° from horizontal to align with the front page’s slope).  \n\n#### Main Title:\n- **\"Mr. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE’S\"**:  \n  - Font: Small caps (e.g., Adobe Caslon Small Caps).  \n  - Size: 24pt.  \n  - Color: #000000.  \n  - Position: Centered above the main title, 10px below the top red border.  \n- **\"SHAKESPEARE\"**:  \n  - Font: Bold serif (e.g., Garamond Bold).  \n  - Size: 72pt (largest text).  \n  - Color: #000000.  \n  - Position: Centered, 30px below \"Mr. WILLIAM\".  \n- **\"COMEDIES, HISTORIES, & TRAGEDIES\"**:  \n  - Font: Serif (e.g., Caslon Regular).  \n  - Size: 48pt.  \n  - Color: #000000.  \n  - Position: Centered, 20px below \"SHAKESPEARE\".  \n\n#### Subtitle:\n- **\"Published according to the True Original Copies\"**:  \n  - Font: Italic serif (e.g., Caslon Italic).  \n  - Size: 18pt.  \n  - Color: #000000.  \n  - Position: Centered, 10px below the genre list, aligned with the portrait’s top edge.  \n\n#### Folded Left Page Text:\nFaint, indistinct text (e.g., \"ACT I\" or \"SCENE I\") is visible on the inner surface of the folded page. Render as:  \n- Font: Serif (e.g., Caslon Regular).  \n- Size: 12pt.  \n- Color: #666666 (light gray).  \n- Position: Randomly scattered lines, rotated -30° to match the page’s curl.  \n\n\n### **6. Critical Geometric and Technical Details for SVG**\nTo ensure scalability and accuracy, include these vector-specific properties:  \n- **Red Borders**: 1px stroke width, #8b0000, no fill.  \n- **Paper Texture**: A <pattern> element with a 1px × 1px grid of #d2b48c dots (10% opacity).  \n- **Engraving Cross-Hatching**: <path> elements with 0.5px stroke width, #333333, arranged in parallel lines.  \n- **Text Rotation**: All front-page text is rotated -15° (to match the book’s angle).  \n- **Foxing**: <circle> elements (1–5px radius) with #d4af37 fill, scattered across both pages (10–15 spots total).  \n- **Background Bokeh**: <ellipse> elements (5–20px radius) in #8b4513, #a52a2a, and #d3d3d3, with 50% opacity and 10px blur.  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key SVG Layers (Bottom to Top)**\n1. **Background**: Muted bokeh (ellipses).  \n2. **Front Page**: Aged beige rectangle with texture/gradient.  \n3. **Spine**: Thin beige rectangle.  \n4. **Folded Left Page**: Curled rectangle with faint text.  \n5. **Red Borders**: Title/portrait frames.  \n6. **Text**: Hierarchical serif fonts (rotated).  \n7. **Portrait Engraving**: Cross-hatching paths (grayscale).  \n8. **Highlights/Shadows**: Gradients, blur, and drop shadows.  \n\nThis detailed breakdown provides all the information needed to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG, capturing both the vintage aesthetic and photographic nuances of the original.",
  "v1_93": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, we’ll break down the composition into **geometric shapes**, **text elements**, **textures**, and **spatial relationships**, with precise coordinates and attributes. The design mimics a vintage parchment document on a wooden surface, with a focus on historical authenticity.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of three primary layers:  \n- **Wooden Background**: A full-bleed rectangle covering the entire canvas.  \n- **Parchment**: A rounded rectangle with two semicircular \"curled\" corners (bottom-left and top-right) and a blue border.  \n- **Text**: A passage from the \"Connecticut Law of 1642\" centered vertically on the parchment, with indentation for clauses.  \n\n#### Key Shapes:\n| Element               | Shape Description                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Wooden Background     | Rectangle (`<rect>`) covering 100% of the image (e.g., `0 0 1000 800` for a 1000x800 canvas). |\n| Parchment             | Rounded rectangle (`<rect>`) with `rx=\"50\" ry=\"50\"` (corner radius 50px) and two semicircular curls (`<circle>` elements clipped to semicircles). |\n| Bottom-Left Curl      | Circle (`<circle>`) with `cx=\"50\" cy=\"750\" r=\"50\"` (center at the parchment’s bottom-left corner), clipped to a 50x50 rectangle (`0 750 50 800`) to show only the downward/leftward curl. |\n| Top-Right Curl        | Circle (`<circle>`) with `cx=\"950\" cy=\"50\" r=\"50\"` (center at the parchment’s top-right corner), clipped to a 50x50 rectangle (`950 0 1000 50`) to show only the upward/rightward curl. |\n| Text                  | Five lines of script text, with the first line centered and subsequent lines indented. |\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll colors and textures are chosen to mimic historical materials (linen parchment, aged wood) and ensure readability.\n\n#### **Wooden Background**\n- **Base Color**: `#654321` (dark brown, mimicking aged oak).  \n- **Texture**: A repeating pattern of horizontal lines in varying shades of brown (`#8B4513`, saddle brown) with subtle opacity variations (0.3–0.9) to simulate wood grain.  \n- **Pattern**: A 100x100px grid with four horizontal lines (stroke widths: 1–3px) to create natural-looking streaks.  \n\n#### **Parchment**\n- **Base Color**: `#F5F0E6` (light beige, linen-like).  \n- **Texture**: A subtle 10x10px cross-hatch pattern (`#E6D8C3`, pale tan) to mimic woven fabric.  \n- **Border**: Solid light blue (`#87CEEB`) with a 2px stroke, following the parchment’s shape (including curls).  \n\n#### **Curls**\n- **Fill**: `#D3D3D3` (light gray, simulating the inner side of a rolled parchment).  \n- **Border**: Matching the parchment’s blue border (`#87CEEB`, 2px stroke).  \n\n#### **Text**\n- **Color**: `#000000` (black, high contrast for readability).  \n- **Font**: \"Lucida Calligraphy\" (web-safe script font) for an old-fashioned, handwritten feel.  \n- **Size**:  \n  - Header: 40px (`Connecticut Law of 1642`).  \n  - Body: 30px (clause text).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe composition is centered for balance, with the parchment as the focal point. All coordinates assume a **1000px × 800px canvas** (adjustable for other sizes).  \n\n| Element               | Position (x, y)       | Dimensions       | Notes                                                                 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Wooden Background     | (0, 0)                | 1000px × 800px   | Full-bleed, behind all other elements.                                |\n| Parchment             | (50, 50)              | 900px × 700px    | Rounded corners (`rx=\"50\" ry=\"50\"`), centered in the canvas.          |\n| Bottom-Left Curl      | (50, 750)             | 50px radius      | Semicircle extending from the parchment’s bottom-left corner (clipped to `0 750 50 800`). |\n| Top-Right Curl        | (950, 50)             | 50px radius      | Semicircle extending from the parchment’s top-right corner (clipped to `950 0 1000 50`). |\n| Text Header           | (500, 150)            | —                | Centered horizontally (`text-anchor=\"middle\"`), top-third of the parchment. |\n| Body Text Lines       | (70, 250), (120, 320), (170, 390), (220, 460) | — | Indented by 50px per line (increasing `x` by 50px) to emphasize clauses. Vertical spacing: 70px between lines. |\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe design evokes a **17th-century legal document** with:  \n- **Vintage Textures**: Linen parchment and wood grain to simulate physical materials.  \n- **Handwritten Aesthetic**: Script font for the text, mimicking quill penmanship.  \n- **Subtle Borders**: A thin blue stroke around the parchment and curls to frame the content without overwhelming it.  \n- **Curled Corners**: Semicircular extensions at the bottom-left and top-right to add depth (like a rolled document).  \n\nThe layout is **left-aligned with clause indentation** (common in historical legal texts) to guide the reader through the sentence structure.\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThe text is the focal point of the parchment, with a clear hierarchical structure:  \n\n| Line # | Text                                  | Position (x, y) | Alignment       | Notes                                                                 |\n|--------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1      | *Connecticut Law of 1642*             | (500, 150)      | Centered        | Header: 40px, bold script.                                            |\n| 2      | *If any man or woman be a witch--*    | (70, 250)       | Left-aligned    | Body: 30px, start of the main clause.                                 |\n| 3      | *that is, hath or consulteth with a*  | (120, 320)      | Indented        | Defines \"witch\" (50px indent from line 2).                            |\n| 4      | *familiar spirit--they shall be put to* | (170, 390)    | Indented        | Continues the definition (50px indent from line 3).                   |\n| 5      | *death*                               | (220, 460)      | Indented        | Final clause (50px indent from line 4), emphasizing the penalty.      |\n\n#### **Key Details**\n- **Hyphenation**: Em dashes (`--`) at the end of lines 2 and 4 mimic historical typesetting (no automatic line breaks).  \n- **Indentation**: Each subsequent clause line is indented by 50px (from `x=70` to `x=120` to `x=170` to `x=220`) to visually separate subclauses.  \n- **Line Spacing**: Consistent 70px between body lines (e.g., `y=250` to `y=320`) for readability.  \n\n\n### **SVG Implementation Guide**\nTo recreate the image, use the following SVG structure, which combines **shapes**, **patterns**, **clips**, and **text** with precise attributes. Adjust coordinates/sizes for different canvas dimensions.\n\n#### **1. Define Textures and Clips**\nUse `<pattern>` for textures (wood, parchment) and `<clipPath>` to shape the curls:\n```svg\n<defs>\n  <!-- Parchment: Linen cross-hatch texture -->\n  <pattern id=\"parchment-pattern\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n    <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" fill=\"#F5F0E6\" />\n    <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"10\" stroke=\"#E6D8C3\" stroke-width=\"0.5\" />\n    <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"10\" x2=\"10\" y2=\"0\" stroke=\"#E6D8C3\" stroke-width=\"0.5\" />\n  </pattern>\n\n  <!-- Wood: Horizontal grain texture -->\n  <pattern id=\"wood-pattern\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" patternUnits=\"userSpaceOnUse\">\n    <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" fill=\"#654321\" />\n    <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"20\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"20\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"2\" opacity=\"0.5\" />\n    <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"40\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"40\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"1\" opacity=\"0.7\" />\n    <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"60\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"60\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"3\" opacity=\"0.3\" />\n    <line x1=\"0\" y1=\"80\" x2=\"100\" y2=\"80\" stroke=\"#8B4513\" stroke-width=\"1\" opacity=\"0.9\" />\n  </pattern>\n\n  <!-- Clip for bottom-left curl (show only semicircle) -->\n  <clipPath id=\"bottom-left-clip\">\n    <rect x=\"0\" y=\"750\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n  </clipPath>\n\n  <!-- Clip for top-right curl (show only semicircle) -->\n  <clipPath id=\"top-right-clip\">\n    <rect x=\"950\" y=\"0\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n  </clipPath>\n</defs>\n```\n\n#### **2. Draw Background and Parchment**\n```svg\n<!-- Wooden background (full bleed) -->\n<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" fill=\"url(#wood-pattern)\" />\n\n<!-- Parchment: Rounded rectangle with blue border -->\n<rect \n  x=\"50\" y=\"50\" \n  width=\"900\" height=\"700\" \n  rx=\"50\" ry=\"50\" \n  fill=\"url(#parchment-pattern)\" \n  stroke=\"#87CEEB\" \n  stroke-width=\"2\" \n/>\n\n<!-- Bottom-left curl (clipped to semicircle) -->\n<circle \n  cx=\"50\" cy=\"750\" r=\"50\" \n  fill=\"#D3D3D3\" \n  stroke=\"#87CEEB\" \n  stroke-width=\"2\" \n  clip-path=\"url(#bottom-left-clip)\" \n/>\n\n<!-- Top-right curl (clipped to semicircle) -->\n<circle \n  cx=\"950\" cy=\"50\" r=\"50\" \n  fill=\"#D3D3D3\" \n  stroke=\"#87CEEB\" \n  stroke-width=\"2\" \n  clip-path=\"url(#top-right-clip)\" \n/>\n```\n\n#### **3. Add Text**\nUse `<text>` and `<tspan>` for precise line positioning:\n```svg\n<!-- Header: Centered -->\n<text \n  x=\"500\" y=\"150\" \n  font-family=\"Lucida Calligraphy\" \n  font-size=\"40\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n  text-anchor=\"middle\" \n>\n  Connecticut Law of 1642\n</text>\n\n<!-- Body Line 2: Left-aligned -->\n<text \n  x=\"70\" y=\"250\" \n  font-family=\"Lucida Calligraphy\" \n  font-size=\"30\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n>\n  If any man or woman be a witch--\n</text>\n\n<!-- Body Line 3: Indented -->\n<text \n  x=\"120\" y=\"320\" \n  font-family=\"Lucida Calligraphy\" \n  font-size=\"30\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n>\n  that is, hath or consulteth with a\n</text>\n\n<!-- Body Line 4: Indented -->\n<text \n  x=\"170\" y=\"390\" \n  font-family=\"Lucida Calligraphy\" \n  font-size=\"30\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n>\n  familiar spirit--they shall be put to\n</text>\n\n<!-- Body Line 5: Indented -->\n<text \n  x=\"220\" y=\"460\" \n  font-family=\"Lucida Calligraphy\" \n  font-size=\"30\" \n  fill=\"#000000\" \n>\n  death\n</text>\n```\n\n\n### **Final Notes for Accuracy**\n- **Font Compatibility**: If \"Lucida Calligraphy\" is unavailable, use \"Edwardian Script ITC\" or \"Brush Script MT\" (add a `@font-face` rule for custom fonts).  \n- **Texture Adjustments**: Modify the pattern sizes (e.g., `width=\"20\" height=\"20\"` for the parchment) to make textures more/less prominent.  \n- **Responsiveness**: Use `viewBox=\"0 0 1000 800\"` to make the SVG scalable (adjust for different canvas sizes).  \n\nThis implementation captures all visual and structural details of the original image, ensuring a faithful reproduction in SVG.",
  "v1_94": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description of its elements, focusing on geometric precision, proportions, and visual properties:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image centers on a **Motorola smartphone** held in a **human hand**, with a gradient background. Key elements include:  \n- **Smartphone**: A rectangular prism with rounded corners (radius ~5% of width). The front features a touchscreen display, a thin black bezel, and the \"MOTOROLA\" logo (centered above the screen).  \n- **Hand**: A right hand (thumb on the left side of the phone, fingers wrapped around the back) holding the phone. A silver ring adorns the index finger (wrapping around the phone’s bottom edge).  \n- **Screen Content**:  \n  - **Notification Bar** (top of screen): Contains text, icons, and a Motorola logo.  \n  - **Main Screen**: Teal background with subtle bubble textures.  \n  - **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Row of 5 app icons (Phone, Text Mess, Market, Browser, Contacts) and a central circular home button.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n#### **Phone Hardware**  \n- **Bezel**: Glossy black (RGB: `#000000`).  \n- **Motorola Logo**: Silvery-gray (RGB: `#C0C0C0`) text, centered above the screen.  \n\n#### **Screen**  \n- **Background**: Solid teal (RGB: `#2E8B57`) with **subtle bubble textures**: 10–20 semi-transparent light blue (RGB: `#87CEEB`, opacity 30%) circles (diameters: 5–15px) scattered randomly.  \n- **Notification Bar**: Light gray (RGB: `#D3D3D3`) background with white (RGB: `#FFFFFF`) text/icons.  \n- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Solid green (RGB: `#2E8B57`) background for the Phone/Market icons and home button; gray (RGB: `#808080`) for Text Mess; blue (RGB: `#1E90FF`) for Browser/Contacts.  \n\n#### **App Icons**  \n- **Phone**: Green square (RGB: `#2E8B57`) with white telephone symbol (simple lines).  \n- **Text Mess**: Gray square (RGB: `#808080`) with white envelope (closed).  \n- **Market**: Green square (RGB: `#2E8B57`) with white shopping bag (open top).  \n- **Browser**: Blue square (RGB: `#1E90FF`) with white globe (grid lines for continents).  \n- **Contacts**: Blue square (RGB: `#1E90FF`) with white person (stick figure).  \n- **Home Button**: Circular green (RGB: `#2E8B57`) background with a white (RGB: `#FFFFFF`) inner circle (3D effect: slight drop shadow).  \n\n#### **Hand**  \n- **Skin**: Peach (RGB: `#FFDAB9`) with subtle wrinkles (light brown, RGB: `#8B4513`, opacity 20%) and pores (black dots, 1px diameter).  \n- **Ring**: Silver (RGB: `#C0C0C0`), smooth texture.  \n\n#### **Background**  \n- Gradient from dark gray (RGB: `#404040`) on the left to light blue (RGB: `#ADD8E6`) on the right, with a soft blur (simulated via linear gradient in SVG).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n#### **Phone**  \n- **Tilt**: Rotated 30° clockwise (top of the phone leans right).  \n- **Proportions**: Aspect ratio ~3:2 (height: 100 units, width: 67 units).  \n- **Screen**: Occupies 90% of the phone’s front (height: 90 units, width: 60 units). Bezel: 3.5 units on all sides.  \n\n#### **Hand**  \n- **Position**: Bottom-left of the image, overlapping the phone’s left edge.  \n- **Thumb**: Covers 1/3 of the phone’s left bezel (from bottom to mid-height).  \n- **Ring**: Centered on the index finger, wrapping around the phone’s bottom-right corner.  \n\n#### **Screen Layout**  \n- **Notification Bar**: 10% of screen height (9 units), spanning full width.  \n  - **Left Align**: \"AT&T\", \"M\" (mail icon), \"Blur NOC\", \"NOC2: Wed Oct 6 00:55:01 U...\", \"about a minute ago\".  \n  - **Right Align**: \"3G\", battery icon (full, white), \"6:00\".  \n- **Main Screen**: 75% of screen height (67.5 units), below the notification bar.  \n- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: 15% of screen height (13.5 units), spanning full width.  \n  - **Icon Spacing**: 5 app icons (each 10x10 units) evenly spaced, with the home button (12x12 units) centered between them.  \n  - **Order (Left to Right)**: Phone → Text Mess → Market → **Home Button** → Browser → Contacts.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Phone Design**: Modern, minimal rectangular shape with rounded corners (corner radius: 8px).  \n- **UI Style**: Flat design (consistent with older Android Blur UI, e.g., Motorola Droid). Icons use simple, recognizable symbols (no gradients).  \n- **Texture Handling**:  \n  - **Screen Bubbles**: Randomly placed, varying sizes (simulate depth with opacity).  \n  - **Hand Skin**: Subtle wrinkles (vector paths) and pores (small circles) for realism.  \n- **Lighting**: The phone’s bezel has a slight reflection (simulated via a white gradient on the top edge, opacity 20%).  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n#### **Notification Bar Text**  \n- **Left**:  \n  - \"AT&T\" (font: sans-serif, 12px, white).  \n  - \"M\" (mail icon, 12px, white).  \n  - \"Blur NOC\" (app name, 12px, white).  \n  - \"NOC2: Wed Oct 6 00:55:01 U...\" (truncated notification, 10px, white).  \n  - \"about a minute ago\" (time ago, 10px, white).  \n- **Right**:  \n  - \"3G\" (network, 12px, white).  \n  - **Battery Icon**: White rectangle (8x4px) with a 2px tab on top (full charge).  \n  - \"6:00\" (time, 14px, white).  \n\n#### **App Icons**  \n- **Phone**: White telephone (2 lines for the handset, 1 line for the base).  \n- **Text Mess**: White envelope (4 lines for the body, 1 line for the flap).  \n- **Market**: White shopping bag (3 lines for the body, 1 line for the handle).  \n- **Browser**: White globe (circle with 3 intersecting lines for continents).  \n- **Contacts**: White person (circle for the head, 2 lines for the body, 2 lines for arms/legs).  \n\n#### **Motorola Logo**  \n- Text: \"MOTOROLA\" (sans-serif, 10px, silvery-gray), centered above the screen (10px from the top bezel).  \n\n\n### **6. Proportions and Layout for SVG**\nTo ensure accurate reproduction, use the following relative measurements (based on a 1000px-tall phone):  \n- **Phone**: 1000px (height) × 670px (width). Rounded corners: 50px.  \n- **Screen**: 900px (height) × 600px (width). Bezel: 35px.  \n- **Notification Bar**: 90px (height).  \n- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: 135px (height).  \n- **App Icons**: 100x100px each, spaced 20px apart.  \n- **Home Button**: 120px diameter, centered in the navigation bar.  \n- **Hand**: 800px (height) × 600px (width), overlapping the phone’s left edge by 150px.  \n\n\n### **7. Key SVG Considerations**\n- **Vectorization**: Convert all elements (phone, hand, icons) to paths. Use `rect` for the phone/screen, `circle` for the home button/bubbles, and `path` for icons/hand.  \n- **Text**: Use `text` elements for all labels (e.g., \"AT&T\", \"6:00\"). Match font (sans-serif, e.g., Arial).  \n- **Textures**: Use `filter` for the screen’s bubble texture (semi-transparent circles) and `gradient` for the background.  \n- **3D Effects**: Simulate the home button’s raised effect with a `drop-shadow` filter.  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as a precise, scalable SVG. Adjustments to proportions or colors can be made based on exact reference measurements, but the above guidelines ensure fidelity to the original image.",
  "v1_95": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description covering all critical elements, including geometric properties, proportions, and visual style:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image is a **vintage software interface screenshot** (circa 1990s-2000s) with three primary sections:  \n- **Top Menu Bar**: A horizontal strip with text menu items.  \n- **Toolbar**: A horizontal strip below the menu bar with monochrome icons.  \n- **Preview Area**: A large central panel displaying a **blurred metallic object** (likely a electronic component, e.g., a capacitor or resistor) with embossed text.  \n\n#### **Menu Bar**  \n- **Shape**: A rectangular bar spanning the full width of the window, with slightly rounded top corners (2px radius).  \n- **Content**: Text items: *File, Edit, View, Insert, Tools, Desktop, Window, Help* (left to right).  \n\n#### **Toolbar**  \n- **Shape**: A rectangular bar (same width as the menu bar) with no rounded corners.  \n- **Content**: 10 monochrome icons (left to right):  \n  1. Folder (File)  \n  2. Disk (Save)  \n  3. Pointer (Select)  \n  4. Magnifying Glass (Zoom)  \n  5. Hand (Pan)  \n  6. Rotate (Arrow Circle)  \n  7. Crop (Square with Corner)  \n  8. Monitor (Desktop)  \n  9. Window (Two Overlapping Squares)  \n  10. Grid (Checkerboard)  \n\n#### **Preview Area**  \n- **Shape**: A large rectangle (centered horizontally) with a dark border (1px black).  \n- **Central Object**: A **rounded rectangular prism** (metallic appearance) with embossed text (*AED-632*) and smaller, indistinct text below.  \n- **Motion Blur**: Horizontal streaks extending left/right from the central object, simulating movement.  \n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \n#### **Menu Bar**  \n- **Color**: Light gray background (#f0f0f0); black text.  \n- **Texture**: Flat, matte (typical of old GUI elements).  \n\n#### **Toolbar**  \n- **Color**: Light gray background (#f0f0f0); black icons.  \n- **Texture**: Flat, with icons using simple geometric shapes (no gradients).  \n\n#### **Preview Area**  \n- **Background**: Dark gray (#202020) with a subtle grainy texture (5% monochrome noise).  \n- **Central Object**:  \n  - **Base Color**: Linear gradient from light gray (#d0d0d0) at the top to dark gray (#404040) at the bottom (simulates 3D depth).  \n  - **Metallic Sheen**: A small, semi-transparent reflection (10% height of the object, 80% width) with a linear gradient from #f0f0f0 (top) to transparent (bottom) (20% opacity).  \n  - **Texture**: Smooth, with a slight Gaussian blur (radius: 2px) to soften edges.  \n- **Embossed Text (*AED-632*)**:  \n  - **Color**: Dark gray (#404040) for the main body; lighter gray (#a0a0a0) on top/left edges (highlights); darker gray (#202020) on bottom/right edges (shadows) (1px bevel for depth).  \n  - **Texture**: Raised (embossed) with a subtle drop shadow (1px offset, 50% opacity, #404040).  \n- **Motion Blur**:  \n  - **Color**: Horizontal streaks (1px thick) transitioning from the object’s dark gray (#404040) to the preview background (#202020).  \n  - **Opacity**: Linear decrease from 100% (at the object’s edges) to 0% (at the preview area’s edges).  \n  - **Texture**: Streaky, uniform (parallel to the x-axis).  \n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \nThe window uses a **4:3 aspect ratio** (typical of vintage displays). Proportions are relative to the window’s total height (H) and width (W):  \n\n| Element               | Position                | Proportions                                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Menu Bar**          | Topmost                 | Height: 5% of H; Width: 100% of W            |\n| **Toolbar**           | Below menu bar          | Height: 5% of H; Width: 100% of W            |\n| **Preview Area**      | Below toolbar           | Height: 90% of H; Width: 95% of W (centered) |\n| **Central Object**    | Centered in preview     | Height: 60% of preview height; Width: 80% of preview width |\n| **Text (*AED-632*)**  | Centered on object      | Height: 40% of object height; Width: 70% of object width |\n\n#### **Toolbar Icons**  \n- **Spacing**: Evenly distributed across the toolbar. Each icon (16x16px) has flexible gaps between them to fill the width.  \n- **Alignment**: Vertically centered in the toolbar.  \n\n#### **Motion Blur**  \n- **Direction**: Horizontal (parallel to the x-axis).  \n- **Extent**: Streaks extend from the left/right edges of the central object to the left/right edges of the preview area.  \n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Vintage GUI Aesthetic**: Mimics 1990s-2000s software (e.g., Windows 95/XP) with flat menus, simple icons, and low-resolution textures.  \n- **Diagnostic/Technical Tone**: The preview area’s dark background, metallic object, and motion blur suggest a tool for viewing/scanning electronic components.  \n- **Blur Effects**:  \n  - **Gaussian Blur** (central object): Softens edges for a \"low-quality scan\" look.  \n  - **Motion Blur**: Adds dynamism, implying the object is moving or being scanned.  \n- **3D Simplicity**: The central object uses a gradient (not complex modeling) to create depth, keeping the style minimal and functional.  \n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**  \n#### **Menu Bar Text**  \n- **Content**: *File, Edit, View, Insert, Tools, Desktop, Window, Help* (capitalized, sans-serif, 12px).  \n- **Spacing**: Evenly distributed (each item centered in a 12.5% segment of the menu bar width).  \n\n#### **Toolbar Icons**  \n- **Symbols**: Standard GUI icons (no text labels):  \n  - **Folder**: Rectangle with a tab (File).  \n  - **Disk**: Circle with a line (Save).  \n  - **Pointer**: Right/down arrow (Select).  \n  - **Magnifying Glass**: Circle with a handle (Zoom).  \n  - **Hand**: Simplified hand (Pan).  \n  - **Rotate**: Circle with a circular arrow (Rotate).  \n  - **Crop**: Square with a corner cut (Crop).  \n  - **Monitor**: Rectangle with a smaller rectangle inside (Desktop).  \n  - **Window**: Two overlapping squares (Window List).  \n  - **Grid**: Checkerboard (Show Grid).  \n\n#### **Central Object Text**  \n- **Main Text**: *AED-632* (bold, sans-serif, embossed).  \n  - **Proportions**: \"AED\" (30% of text width), \"-\" (10%), \"632\" (60%).  \n  - **Embossing**: 1px bevel (highlights on top/left, shadows on bottom/right).  \n- **Smaller Text**: Indistinct (blurred) below *AED-632* (likely a part number or manufacturer).  \n\n#### **Border Details**  \n- **Window Border**: 1px gray (#c0c0c0) around the entire window.  \n- **Preview Area Border**: 1px black around the preview panel (separates it from the menu/toolbar).  \n\n\n### **6. Geometric Details for SVG Recreation**  \n#### **Menu Bar**  \n- **Shape**: `<rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"5%\" rx=\"2\" ry=\"2\"` (rounded top corners).  \n- **Text**: Use `<text>` elements for each menu item, centered in their respective segments.  \n\n#### **Toolbar**  \n- **Shape**: `<rect x=\"0\" y=\"5%\" width=\"100%\" height=\"5%\"` (no rounded corners).  \n- **Icons**: Use basic shapes (`<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<path>`) for each icon. For example:  \n  - **Folder**: `<rect x=\"10\" y=\"2\" width=\"12\" height=\"10\"` + `<rect x=\"10\" y=\"2\" width=\"3\" height=\"5\"` (tab).  \n  - **Disk**: `<circle cx=\"18\" cy=\"10\" r=\"5\"` + `<line x1=\"13\" y1=\"10\" x2=\"23\" y2=\"10\"` (line across top).  \n\n#### **Preview Area**  \n- **Shape**: `<rect x=\"2.5%\" y=\"10%\" width=\"95%\" height=\"90%\" fill=\"#202020\"` (centered, 2.5% margins left/right).  \n- **Central Object**:  \n  - **Base**: `<rect x=\"10%\" y=\"20%\" width=\"80%\" height=\"60%\" rx=\"5\" ry=\"5\"` (rounded edges).  \n  - **Gradient**: `<linearGradient id=\"objGradient\" x1=\"0\" y1=\"0\" x2=\"0\" y2=\"1\">` with stops at `#d0d0d0` (0%), `#808080` (50%), `#404040` (100%).  \n  - **Reflection**: `<rect x=\"10%\" y=\"20%\" width=\"80%\" height=\"6%\" fill=\"url(#reflectionGradient)\" opacity=\"0.2\"` (10% of object height = 6% of preview height).  \n- **Motion Blur**: Use `<line>` elements (1px thick) with varying opacity. For example:  \n  - `<line x1=\"0\" y1=\"50%\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"50%\" stroke=\"#303030\" stroke-opacity=\"0.8\"` (close to object).  \n  - `<line x1=\"0\" y1=\"50%\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"50%\" stroke=\"#202020\" stroke-opacity=\"0.2\"` (far from object).  \n\n#### **Embossed Text**  \n- **Shape**: Use `<text>` elements with a **bevel effect** (via SVG filters or manual color stops). For example:  \n  - **Highlights**: `<text fill=\"#a0a0a0\" x=\"20%\" y=\"50%\"` (top/left edges).  \n  - **Shadows**: `<text fill=\"#202020\" x=\"20.5%\" y=\"50.5%\"` (bottom/right offset).  \n  - **Main Text**: `<text fill=\"#404040\" x=\"20%\" y=\"50%\"` (overlays highlights/shadows).  \n\n#### **Grain Texture**  \n- **Method**: Use a `<filter>` with `<feTurbulence>` to add noise to the preview area. For example:  \n  - `<filter id=\"grain\">`  \n    - `<feTurbulence type=\"fractalNoise\" baseFrequency=\"0.5\" result=\"noise\"`  \n    - `<feComposite in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"noise\" operator=\"arithmetic\" k1=\"0\" k2=\"1\" k3=\"0.05\" k4=\"0\"`  \n  - `</filter>`  \n  - Apply to the preview area: `<rect filter=\"url(#grain)\"`  \n\n\n### **7. Key SVG Considerations**  \n- **Responsiveness**: Use relative units (% or viewbox) to maintain proportions across screen sizes.  \n- **Filters**: Use `<filter>` elements for Gaussian blur (central object), motion blur (streaks), and grain (preview area).  \n- **Gradients**: Use `<linearGradient>` for the central object’s depth and reflection.  \n- **Icons**: Keep toolbar icons simple (no complex paths) to match the vintage style.  \n- **Text**: Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica) for menu items and the central object’s text.  \n\nThis description provides all the necessary details to recreate the image as an SVG, including geometric precision, color values, and stylistic choices. Adjustments to pixel-specific values (e.g., icon size, blur radius) can be made based on the desired final resolution.",
  "v1_96": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, here is a detailed, structured description covering all critical elements, including geometry, proportions, and visual properties:\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe primary object is a **book cover** standing upright, with a focus on a vibrant, illustrative design. Key elements include:  \n- **Book Cover**: A rectangular shape (approx. 3:4 aspect ratio, e.g., 300px wide × 400px tall) with a **spine** on the left edge (indicated by a subtle shadow).  \n- **Title Text**: Centered at the top.  \n- **Subtitle Text**: Below the title.  \n- **Character Group**: 5 cartoon-style figures standing on a **pile of rocks** in the lower third of the cover.  \n- **Logo**: At the bottom right corner.  \n- **Background**: A gradient blue sky with subtle cloud shapes.  \n\n#### **Characters (Left-to-Right Viewer Perspective)**  \nAll characters have **chibi proportions** (large heads, small bodies) with rounded features. They are arranged in a semi-circle on the rocks, with the central figure as the focal point.  \n1. **Leftmost Character**: A small, simple figure (child/soldier) with brown hair, wearing a plain tunic. Holds a **sword** (gold hilt, silver blade) pointing downward.  \n2. **Viking**: Taller, with a **silver horned helmet** (two triangular horns), chainmail shirt, and brown pants.

Technical Specifications for SVG**\nTo ensure accuracy, include these geometric and color details:  \n- **Book Dimensions**: 180mm (width) × 250mm (height) (adjust for tilt in SVG using transform: rotate(-10°)).  \n- **Brushstroke Paths**: Use overlapping rectangles/polygons with varying opacities (50–80%) to mimic impasto.  \n- **Cityscape Layers**: Each building is a stack of horizontal rectangles (10–15mm height) with varying colors (use clipping paths to create building shapes).  \n- **Window Dots**: Small rectangles (2mm × 1mm) with 1mm radius (rounded corners) for a \"glowing\" effect.  \n- **Leaf Veins**: Use thin (0.5mm) lines with 20% opacity to mimic translucency.  \n- **Text Paths**: Convert text to outlines (SVG `<path>`) to preserve font details (especially the curved stroke in \"光\").  \n\n\n### **Summary of Key SVG Layers**\n1. **Background**: Light gray surface (#F0F0F0) with book shadow.  \n2. **Book Cover**: Main layer with textured background, text, and cityscape.  \n3. **Leaves**: Behind the book (partially obscured).  \n4. **Computer Screen**: Behind the book (right edge).  \n\nThis description provides all necessary details to recreate the image as an SVG, including geometric precision, color values, and artistic style. Adjustments for tilt, texture, and layering will ensure the final SVG matches the original image closely.",
  "v1_98": "To accurately recreate this image as an SVG, below is a detailed, technical description of its components, layout, and style. The image is a minimalist, cartographic design focused on highlighting a specific region of the world using high contrast and simplified geometry.\n\n\n### **1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\nThe image consists of three primary layers, ordered from background to foreground:  \n- **Background**: A solid, rectangular field filling the entire canvas.  \n- **World Map**: A stylized, outline-only map of the world with **country-level borders** (visible in all continents except Antarctica). The map includes all major continents (North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia) and uses simplified, recognizable shapes (e.g., Africa’s triangular form, North America’s \"U\" shape).  \n- **Highlighted Region**: A contiguous, filled polygon covering a large portion of **Eastern Europe and Northern/Central Asia**. This region includes the following countries (defined by their exact border outlines from the world map):  \n  - **European**: Russia (European part), Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan.  \n  - **Asian**: Russia (Asian part/Siberia), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan.  \n\nThe world map and highlighted region share identical border geometry—this is critical for SVG accuracy (the highlighted region is simply the **fill** applied to specific country paths from the map).\n\n\n### **2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\nAll elements use **flat, solid colors** with no gradients, textures, or transparency. The palette is limited to three high-contrast hues for clarity:  \n- **Background**: Medium neutral gray (`#808080`).  \n- **World Map**: White (`#FFFFFF`) outline strokes (no fill).  \n- **Highlighted Region**: Pure red (`#FF0000`) fill, with white outline strokes (matching the world map).  \n\n#### **Stroke Details**  \nThe world map and highlighted region use **consistent stroke width** for borders. For a typical SVG viewbox (e.g., `1000x600`), a stroke width of `0.5` units is recommended—this creates a thin, clean line that avoids cluttering the design.  \n\n#### **Fill Details**  \n- The background is a solid fill covering 100% of the canvas.  \n- The world map has **no fill** (only strokes), so the gray background shows through.  \n- The highlighted region has a **solid red fill** applied to its constituent country paths, with white strokes to maintain border visibility.\n\n\n### **3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is **centered and balanced** to display all continents with minimal cropping. Key spatial rules:  \n- **Background**: A rectangle with dimensions matching the SVG’s viewbox (e.g., `width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"`).  \n- **World Map**: Positioned such that:  \n  - **Horizontal**: North America is left of center, Europe/Africa in the middle, and Asia/Australia on the right.  \n  - **Vertical**: The Arctic Circle (top of Greenland/Russia) is near the top of the background, and the southern tip of South America is near the bottom.  \n  - **Padding**: ~10% of the viewbox width/height is left empty around the map to avoid edge cropping (e.g., for a `1000x600` viewbox, the map spans `x=100` to `x=900` and `y=50` to `y=550`).  \n- **Highlighted Region**: Occupies the **right 40% of the map**, extending from the Baltic Sea (east of Poland) eastward to the Pacific Ocean (Kamchatka Peninsula) and southward to the Caspian Sea (Turkmenistan) and Himalayas (Tajikistan). The region is **contiguous** (no gaps between countries) and dominates the visual focus due to its red fill.\n\n\n### **4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\nThe design is **minimalist and modern**, with a focus on **functional clarity** over realism. Key style rules:  \n- **Simplification**: Country borders are stylized (not geographically exact) but recognizable (e.g., Russia’s \"teardrop\" shape in Asia).  \n- **Hierarchy**: The color palette creates a clear visual hierarchy:  \n  1. **Background** (`#808080`): Neutral base.  \n  2. **World Map** (`#FFFFFF`): Secondary layer (outlines).  \n  3. **Highlighted Region** (`#FF0000`): Focal point (fill + outlines).  \n- **Flat Design**: No 3D effects, shadows, or bevels—all elements are 2D and geometric.  \n- **Cartographic Style**: The map uses a **Mercator-like projection** (simplified for readability) with consistent scale across continents (e.g., Africa is larger than Europe, South America is smaller than Africa).\n\n\n### **5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\nThe image contains **no text, labels, legends, or symbols**. This intentional omission keeps the design universal and avoids distracting from the highlighted region.  \n\n#### **Critical SVG Technical Details**  \nTo ensure accurate reproduction, the following must be strictly adhered to:  \n- **Viewbox**: Use a **fixed aspect ratio** to maintain map proportions. A recommended viewbox is `0 0 1000 600` (16:9), which balances width for continent display.  \n- **Path Geometry**: The world map and highlighted region must share **identical border paths**. For example, the border between Russia and China in the world map must be the exact same `d` attribute in the highlighted region’s Russia path.  \n  - **Source**: Use a reliable cartographic dataset (e.g., [Natural Earth](https://naturalearthdata.com/) 1:10m country borders) to extract path coordinates.  \n- **Layer Order**: The SVG must follow this stacking order (from bottom to top):  \n  1. Background (`<rect>`).  \n  2. World Map (`<g id=\"world-map\">` with `<path>` elements, `fill=\"none\"`).  \n  3. Highlighted Region (`<g id=\"highlighted-region\">` with `<path>` elements, `fill=\"#FF0000\"`).  \n- **Stroke Consistency**: All paths (world map and highlighted region) must use the same `stroke-width` (e.g., `0.5`) and `stroke` (`#FFFFFF`).  \n\n\n### **SVG Structure Template**\nBelow is a simplified SVG skeleton that implements the above rules. Replace `...` with actual path data (from a cartographic source) for each country:  \n```svg\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 1000 600\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\n  <!-- Background: Covers entire canvas -->\n  <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#808080\"/>\n\n  <!-- World Map: Outline-only, country borders -->\n  <g id=\"world-map\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"0.5\" fill=\"none\">\n    <!-- North America -->\n    <path d=\"M150 200, ... , Z\"/> <!-- United States -->\n    <path d=\"M200 150, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Canada -->\n    <!-- South America -->\n    <path d=\"M250 400, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Brazil -->\n    <!-- Africa -->\n    <path d=\"M450 300, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Nigeria -->\n    <!-- Europe -->\n    <path d=\"M500 250, ... , Z\"/> <!-- France -->\n    <path d=\"M550 200, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Germany -->\n    <!-- Asia -->\n    <path d=\"M600 150, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Russia (European) -->\n    <path d=\"M650 200, ... , Z\"/> <!-- China -->\n    <!-- Australia -->\n    <path d=\"M750 500, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Australia -->\n    <!-- Add all other countries here -->\n  </g>\n\n  <!-- Highlighted Region: Red fill for specific countries -->\n  <g id=\"highlighted-region\" stroke=\"#FFFFFF\" stroke-width=\"0.5\" fill=\"#FF0000\">\n    <!-- Eastern Europe -->\n    <path d=\"M600 150, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Russia (European) -->\n    <path d=\"M580 220, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Belarus -->\n    <path d=\"M560 250, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Ukraine -->\n    <path d=\"M540 280, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Moldova -->\n    <path d=\"M620 300, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Georgia -->\n    <path d=\"M640 320, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Armenia -->\n    <path d=\"M660 340, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Azerbaijan -->\n    <!-- Asia -->\n    <path d=\"M680 200, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Russia (Asian) -->\n    <path d=\"M700 300, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Kazakhstan -->\n    <path d=\"M720 350, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Kyrgyzstan -->\n    <path d=\"M740 380, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Tajikistan -->\n    <path d=\"M760 400, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Uzbekistan -->\n    <path d=\"M780 420, ... , Z\"/> <!-- Turkmenistan -->\n  </g>\n</svg>\n```\n\n\n### **Summary of Key Requirements for SVG Reproduction**\n1. **Geometry**: Use identical path data for the world map and highlighted region borders.  \n2. **Color**: Strictly adhere to `#808080` (background), `#FFFFFF` (strokes), and `#FF0000` (highlight fill).  \n3. **Layout**: Center the map in a `1000x600` viewbox with 10% padding.  \n4. **Style**: Flat, minimalistic design with consistent stroke width (`0.5` units).  \n5. **Layer Order**: Background → World Map (outlines) → Highlighted Region (fill + outlines).  \n\nBy following these guidelines, the SVG will accurately replicate the image’s visual hierarchy, contrast, and geographic focus.",

Textures are minimal (subtle gradients for depth, segmentation lines for crabs/squid).\n\n| Organism         | Main Color       | Accent Color       | Outline Color      |\n|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Phytoplankton     | `#2E8B57` (green) | `#90EE90` (light green) | `#90EE90` (light green) |\n| Seaweed           | `#2E8B57` (green) | `#90EE90` (light green) | `#90EE90` (light green) |\n| Zooplankton       | `#D2B48C` (tan)  | `#FF6347` (red)    | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Krill             | `#FFA07A` (orange-pink) | `#FF8C00` (dark orange) | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Crab              | `#FF0000` (red)  | `#DC143C` (dark red) | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Fish              | `#4682B4` (blue-green) | `#87CEEB` (light blue) | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Squid             | `#800080` (purple) | `#9932CC` (light purple) | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Penguin           | `#000000` (black) | `#FFFFFF` (white)  | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Seagull           | `#FFFFFF` (white) | `#000000` (black)  | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Leopard Seal      | `#808080` (gray) | `#000000` (black spots) | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Elephant Seal     | `#8B4513` (brown) | `#A0522D` (light brown) | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Blue Whale        | `#00008B` (dark blue) | `#87CEEB` (light blue, fluke) | `#000000` (black)  |\n| Killer Whale      | `#000000` (black) | `#FFFFFF` (white patches) | `#000000` (black)  |\n\n**Textures**:  \n- **Blue Whale**: Subtle gradient from `#00008B` (back) to `#87CEEB` (belly) for depth.  \n- **Crab**: Small segmentation lines (1px, `#DC143C`) on the carapace.  \n- **Squid**: Suction cups (1px black dots) on tentacles.  \n- **Leopard Seal**: 5-6 black spots (3-4px circles) on the back.  \n\n\n## **4. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\nThe layout is a **web-like structure** with arrows connecting prey to predator. Below is a table of positions (x, y) for each organism (using a 1000x1000 canvas) and the arrows between them:\n\n| Organism         | Position (x, y) |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Phytoplankton     | (250, 800)      |\n| Seaweed           | (550, 750)      |\n| Zooplankton       | (100, 700)      |\n| Krill             | (350, 650)      |\n| Crab              | (850, 800)      |\n| Fish              | (150, 550)      |\n| Squid             | (700, 650)      |\n| Penguin           | (650, 500)      |\n| Seagull           | (100, 350)      |\n| Leopard Seal      | (500, 400)      |\n| Elephant Seal     | (850, 350)      |\n| Blue Whale        | (250, 150)      |\n| Killer Whale      | (750, 150)      |\n\n### **Arrows (Energy Flow)**\nAll arrows are **thin black lines (1px)** with sharp arrowheads (10px long × 5px wide). They point from **prey** (lower trophic level) to **predator** (higher trophic level). Below is a list of all arrows with their start/end points:\n\n| Prey             | Predator         | Start Position (x, y) | End Position (x, y) |\n|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| Phytoplankton     | Zooplankton      | (250, 800)            | (100, 700)          |\n| Phytoplankton     | Krill            | (250, 800)            | (350, 650)          |\n| Seaweed           | Crab             | (550, 750)            | (850, 800)          |\n| Zooplankton       | Fish             | (100, 700)            | (150, 550)          |\n| Krill             | Blue Whale       | (350, 650)            | (250, 150)          |\n| Krill             | Penguin          | (350, 650)            | (650, 500)          |\n| Krill             | Squid            | (350, 650)            | (700, 650)          |\n| Fish              | Seagull          | (150, 550)            | (100, 350)          |\n| Penguin           | Leopard Seal     | (650, 500)            | (500, 400)          |\n| Penguin           | Killer Whale     | (650, 500)            | (750, 150)          |\n| Squid             | Elephant Seal    | (700, 650)            | (850, 350)          |\n| Leopard Seal      | Killer Whale     | (500, 400)            | (750, 150)          |\n| Elephant Seal     | Killer Whale     | (850, 350)            | (750, 150)          |\n\n\n## **5. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Style**: Cartoonish, minimalistic, and educational (designed to be easily recognizable).  \n- **Outlines**: Thick (2px) black outlines for consumers, thin (1px) light green outlines for producers.  \n- **Proportions**: Exaggerated for visibility (e.g., Blue Whale is the largest, Phytoplankton is the smallest).  \n- **Balance**: Symmetrical left-to-right with producers at the bottom and top predators at the top.  \n- **Negative Space**: White background with ample space between organisms to avoid clutter.  \n\n\n## **6. Text and Symbols**\n- **Font**: Sans-serif (e.g., Arial) for all labels.  \n- **Font Size**: 12pt (consistent for all labels).  \n- **Font Color**: Black (`#000000`).  \n- **Text Placement**:  \n  - **Producers/Consumers**: Labels centered **below** the organism (e.g., \"Phytoplankton\" below the phytoplankton cluster).  \n  - **Top Predators**: Labels centered **above** the organism (e.g., \"Blue Whale\" above the blue whale) because they are at the top of the canvas.  \n\n\n## **7. Key Details for SVG Reproduction**\n- **Outlines**: Use `<stroke>` with a width of 2px for consumers and 1px for producers.  \n- **Arrows**: Use `<line>` with a stroke width of 1px and `<polygon>` for the arrowhead (points: `(x, y), (x-10, y+5), (x-10, y-5)`).  \n- **Gradients**: For the Blue Whale’s belly, use a linear gradient from `#00008B` (back) to `#87CEEB` (belly).  \n- **Spots/Stripes**: Use `<circle>` for Leopard Seal spots (3-4px diameter) and `<line>` for Fish stripes (1px width).  \n- **Suction Cups**: Use `<circle>` (1px diameter) on Squid tentacles, spaced 2px apart.  \n\nBy following this detailed description, you can accurately reproduce the image as an SVG with all geometric, color, and spatial properties intact. The result will be a clear, educational food web that is true to the original design."
