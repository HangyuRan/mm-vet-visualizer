  "v1_112": "I can see a beach scene photograph with two people, but I need to clarify something important: this appears to be a photographic image rather than something that would be suitable for SVG recreation. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is best suited for simple geometric shapes, icons, logos, and illustrations with clean lines and solid colors.\n\nHere's a detailed description of the image:\n\n## Main Elements:\n- **Two people**: A man carrying a woman on his back (piggyback style)\n- **Beach setting**: Sandy beach with ocean waves\n- **Sky**: Clear blue sky with bright lighting\n\n## People Details:\n- **Man**: Wearing a light-colored (beige/tan) long-sleeved shirt, dark hair, smiling broadly\n- **Woman**: Has curly/wavy dark hair, wearing what appears to be a light-colored top, laughing/smiling, arms wrapped around the man's shoulders\n\n## Colors and Lighting:\n- **Dominant colors**: Blue (ocean/sky), beige/tan (clothing, sand), white (foam from waves)\n- **Lighting**: Bright, natural sunlight creating a warm, golden-hour effect\n- **Contrast**: High contrast between the bright subjects and the blue background\n\n## Spatial Relationships:\n- Subjects positioned in the foreground, slightly left of center\n- Ocean waves in the middle ground\n- Clear sky in the background\n- The composition follows the rule of thirds\n\n## Style Characteristics:\n- **Photographic style**: High-quality, professional portrait photography\n- **Mood**: Joyful, candid, romantic\n- **Depth of field**: Sharp focus on subjects with slightly softer background\n- **Perspective**: Shot from slightly below eye level\n\n**Important Note**: This is a complex photographic image with realistic human figures, natural lighting, and organic textures that would be extremely difficult to recreate accurately as an SVG. SVGs work best for simple, geometric designs. If you need an SVG version, I'd recommend creating a simplified, stylized interpretation rather than attempting to replicate the photographic realism.\n\nWould you like me to suggest how this could be simplified into basic geometric shapes for SVG creation, or did you have a different type of image in mind?",

It contains 9 main elements connected by black arrows.\n\n## Elements and Shapes\n\n### Start/End Nodes\n- **Start node**: Green oval at the top with \"Start\" text in black\n- **Stop node**: Pink/salmon colored oval at the bottom with \"Stop\" text in black\n\n### Process Boxes\nAll process boxes are rectangular with yellow/light yellow background and black text:\n1. \"Turn on kettle\"\n2. \"Wait for kettle to boil\"\n3. \"Wait\" (smaller box on the right side)\n4. \"Pour water on teabag in cup\"\n5. \"Wait 2-3 min\"\n6. \"Add milk and sugar\"\n\n### Decision Diamond\n- Orange/amber colored diamond shape with \"Water boiled?\" text\n- Has two exit paths labeled \"Y\" (Yes) and \"N\" (No)\n\n## Flow and Connections\n- Black arrows connect all elements\n- The decision diamond creates a branch:\n  - \"N\" path leads to the \"Wait\" box\n  - \"Y\" path continues to \"Pour water on teabag in cup\"\n- The \"Wait\" box has an arrow that loops back to \"Wait for kettle to boil\"\n\n## Colors\n- **Green**: Start oval\n- **Yellow/Light yellow**: All rectangular process boxes\n- **Orange/Amber**: Decision diamond\n- **Pink/Salmon**: Stop oval\n- **Black**: All text and connecting arrows\n\n## Text Properties\nAll text appears to be in a clean, sans-serif font with consistent sizing. Text is centered within each shape.\n\n## Spatial Relationships\n- The main flow follows a straight vertical path\n- The decision point creates a horizontal branch to the right\n- The \"Wait\" box is positioned to the right of the main flow\n- Elements are evenly spaced with consistent margins\n- The loop-back arrow from \"Wait\" to \"Wait for kettle to boil\" creates a curved connection\n\nThis flowchart represents a standard algorithmic approach to tea-making with a conditional loop for waiting until the water boils.",
