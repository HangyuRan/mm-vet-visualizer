Visual Decomposition\n- **Main elements**: A handwritten mathematical equation in green\n- **Content**: The equation \"(x + 3)² = 4\"\n- **Color**: Bright lime green (#7ED321 approximate)\n- **Style**: Hand-drawn appearance with slightly irregular strokes\n- **Background**: White/transparent\n\n### 2. Structural Analysis\n- **Left side**: Binomial expression (x + 3) with exponent 2\n- **Right side**: The number 4\n- **Layout**: Horizontal arrangement following standard mathematical notation\n- **Proportions**: The superscript \"2\" is smaller and positioned above the baseline\n- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing between elements\n\n### 3. SVG Implementation Strategy\n- Use `<text>` elements for the main equation components\n- Position the superscript \"2\" using `<tspan>` with baseline-shift\n- Apply green stroke/fill color consistently\n- Use a font that approximates handwritten mathematical notation\n- Maintain proper spacing and alignment\n\n### 4. Technical Considerations\n- **Viewport**: 400x150 pixels provides adequate space\n- **Scalability**: Using relative units and proper viewBox\n- **Font**: Sans-serif font with appropriate weight for visibility\n- **Positioning**: Centered horizontally with proper vertical alignment\n\n## Complete Reasoning Process\n\nThe equation represents a quadratic expression in factored form. The handwritten style suggests this is likely from a mathematical worksheet or problem-solving session. The bright green color makes it highly visible and the positioning is centered for emphasis.\n\nFor SVG implementation, I need to:\n- Recreate the mathematical notation accurately\n- Maintain the visual weight and color of the original\n- Ensure proper spacing between mathematical elements\n- Handle the superscript positioning correctly\n\n## Final SVG Code Implementation\n\n```svg",

SVG Implementation Strategy:\nThis is a complex photographic image with realistic human figures, detailed clothing, realistic lighting, and complex background elements. Creating an accurate SVG representation would require:\n- Complex path elements for human figures\n- Detailed gradients for realistic lighting\n- Multiple layers for depth\n- Intricate shapes for facial features and clothing details\n\nHowever, I should note that SVG is typically better suited for:\n- Simple illustrations\n- Icons and logos\n- Geometric designs\n- Stylized representations\n\nFor a realistic photograph like this, a simplified, stylized SVG interpretation would be more appropriate and practical.\n\n\nI'll approach the SVG design with a minimalist strategy, using basic geometric shapes to capture the scene's core essence. The goal is to distill the professional meeting into an iconic, scalable representation that preserves the key spatial relationships and group dynamics. I'll use simple rectangles and circles to suggest human figures, a central rectangular laptop, and clean lines to indicate the table and office environment.</think>\n\nI'll analyze this image and create a structured SVG representation.

Structural Analysis\n- **Arrangement**: Single leaf positioned centrally, spots distributed organically across surface\n- **Proportions**: Leaf is roughly 3:2 ratio (width:height), spots vary from small to medium size\n- **Patterns**: No strict symmetry - natural, organic distribution of damage spots\n- **Layering**: Background blur effect, main leaf surface, spots on top, subtle vein details\n\n### 3. SVG Implementation Strategy\n- **Main leaf**: Use `<path>` or `<ellipse>` with gradient fill for realistic coloring\n- **Disease spots**: Multiple `<path>` elements with irregular shapes\n- **Background**: Soft gradient or blurred circles for depth\n- **Drawing order**: Background → main leaf → spots → details/highlights\n\n### 4.

They want me to analyze this image and create an SVG representation through a structured thinking process.\n\nLet me break this down step by step:\n\n1. Visual Decomposition:\n- There are 4 pie charts total - 2 for Australia (1980 and 2000) and 2 for France (1980 and 2000)\n- Each pie chart shows different fuel sources with different colors\n- There are titles for each country\n- Each chart has total production numbers\n- There are legends showing what each color represents\n\n2.

Structural Analysis:\n- The charts are arranged in a 2x2 grid\n- Australia charts on top, France on bottom\n- 1980 on left, 2000 on right\n\n\n- Each chart has a title, pie chart, and total production text\n- There are legends for the fuel types\n\n4. SVG Implementation Strategy:\nI'll create a precise visual representation using SVG technologies. The approach involves calculating precise pie segment angles, using path elements for chart segments, and incorporating text and legend elements. Geometric precision will be key in translating these data visualizations accurately.\n\nThe implementation requires careful angle calculations for each pie segment, ensuring proportional representation of different fuel sources across the two time periods and countries.\n\nCalculating segment angles reveals interesting distribution patterns:\n\nAustralia's fuel mix shows dramatic shifts between 1980 and 2000. In 1980, green energy dominates with 180°, while red and blue segments share equal 72° portions. By 2000, green energy expands dramatically to 275.3°, with red maintaining similar representation at 76.2°.\n\nFrance demonstrates different energy transitions. In 1980, blue, yellow, and green segments each occupy 100° or less, with brown and red segments representing smaller proportions. By 2000, brown energy dramatically increases to 252°, with green reducing to a modest 50° segment.\n\nThese precise angle calculations enable accurate SVG pie chart representations that visually communicate complex energy production transformations.</think>\n\nI'll analyze this image systematically and create an SVG representation.\n\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n### 1.

  "v1_39": "<think>This is a complex request. The user is asking me to analyze an image and create an SVG representation through a structured thinking process. Let me look at the image first.\n\nThe image shows a tire repair kit instruction guide with 8 steps. It's laid out in a grid format with yellow sections and shows hands performing various steps of tire repair. The main elements I can see are:\n\n1. A large tire/wheel in multiple panels\n2. Hands holding various tools \n3. Yellow background sections with black text\n4. Step numbers (1-8)\n5. Instructions for each step\n6. The SecureGuard logo and \"TIRE REPAIR KIT\" text at the top\n\nThis is quite a complex image with photographic elements, detailed illustrations, and text. Creating an accurate SVG representation would be extremely challenging and would require:\n- Complex path definitions for the tire tread pattern\n- Detailed hand illustrations\n- Typography matching\n- Color gradients and shading\n- Precise positioning of multiple elements\n\nHowever, I should be careful here. The user is asking me to analyze an image and create SVG code, but I don't have access to any files or codebase context. This seems like a standalone request for image analysis and SVG generation.\n\nGiven the complexity of this instructional diagram, a complete SVG recreation would be thousands of lines of code and would need to capture:\n- Photorealistic tire textures\n- Hand positions and skin tones\n- Tool details\n- Typography and layout\n- Color schemes and gradients\n\nThis would be a massive undertaking that goes beyond what would be practical to provide in a single response. I should provide a structured analysis as requested, but also be realistic about the scope of what can be achieved in SVG form for such a complex image.\n\nLet me proceed with the analysis framework they've provided, but I'll need to be practical about the SVG implementation - perhaps focusing on the key structural elements rather than attempting to recreate every photographic detail.</think>\n\nI'll analyze this tire repair instruction image and work through the structured process you've outlined.\n\n## Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n### 1.

Structural Analysis\n\n**Arrangement and Layering:**\n- Top banner with logo and title\n- Main content in 4x2 grid of equal-sized panels\n- Each panel contains: step number, instruction text, and illustration\n- Consistent visual hierarchy with numbered steps\n- Hands and tools layered over tire illustrations\n\n**Proportions and Spatial Relationships:**\n- Header takes ~15% of total height\n- Each panel is approximately 1:1 aspect ratio\n- Tire illustrations maintain consistent size and position\n- Tools shown at actual scale relative to tire\n\n**Patterns and Symmetry:**\n- Alternating yellow/white panel backgrounds\n- Consistent tire positioning across panels\n- Repetitive hand gesture patterns\n- Uniform typography and numbering system\n\n### 3. SVG Implementation Strategy\n\n**Optimal SVG Elements:**\n- `<rect>` for panel backgrounds and grid structure\n- `<circle>` and `<ellipse>` for tire base shapes\n- `<path>` for complex tire tread patterns\n- `<path>` for hand silhouettes (simplified)\n- `<rect>` and `<path>` for tools\n- `<text>` for all typography\n- `<g>` for grouping related elements\n\n**Drawing Order:**\n1. Background panels and grid\n2. Tire base shapes\n3. Tread patterns\n4. Hand silhouettes\n5. Tools and repair materials\n6. Text and numbering\n7. Header logo and branding\n\n### 4. Technical Considerations\n\n**Viewport Dimensions:**\n- Aspect ratio approximately 4:3 (width:height)\n- Suggested viewBox: \"0 0 800 600\"\n- Scalable units for responsive design\n\n**Scalability Approach:**\n- Vector-based shapes for all geometric elements\n- Relative positioning using percentages\n- Consistent stroke-width scaling\n- Readable text at multiple sizes\n\n## SVG Implementation\n\nGiven the complexity of this instructional diagram, I'll provide a simplified but structured SVG that captures the essential layout and key elements:\n\n```svg",

Visual Decomposition\n**Main visual elements:**\n- A troubleshooting flowchart for a non-working lamp\n- **Geometric shapes identified:**\n  - Rounded rectangle (start/problem): \"Lamp doesn't work\"\n  - Diamond shapes (decision points): \"Lamp plugged in?\" and \"Bulb burned out?\"\n  - Rectangular boxes (action items): \"Plug in lamp\", \"Replace bulb\", \"Repair lamp\"\n- **Key colors:**\n  - Pink/salmon for the problem statement\n  - Yellow for decision diamonds\n  - Green for action/solution boxes\n  - Black for text and connecting lines\n\n### 2. Structural Analysis\n**Arrangement and flow:**\n- Vertical primary flow with horizontal branches\n- Start box at top, flowing down through decision points\n- Binary decision structure (Yes/No paths)\n- Three terminal action boxes\n- **Proportions:** Decision diamonds are roughly square when rotated, rectangles are wider than tall\n- **Spatial relationships:** Consistent spacing, clear directional flow with arrows\n\n### 3. SVG Implementation Strategy\n**Element mapping:**\n- `<rect>` with `rx` attribute for rounded rectangles\n- `<path>` or `<polygon>` for diamond shapes\n- `<line>` and `<polygon>` for arrows\n- `<text>` elements for all labels\n- **Drawing order:** Background shapes first, then connecting lines, then text overlays\n\n### 4. Technical Considerations\n- **Viewport:** 800x600 to accommodate the full diagram with padding\n- **Scalability:** Using viewBox for responsive scaling\n- **Optimizations:** Reusable arrow marker definitions\n\n## Final SVG Implementation:\n\n```svg",

They've provided a specific 4-step framework and want me to follow it.\n\nLooking at the image, I can see it's a collage of 10 celebrity headshots arranged in a 2x5 grid format. The photos appear to be professional headshots or red carpet photos of what look like celebrities. Each photo is cropped to show mainly the face/head area.\n\nLet me go through their requested analysis structure:\n\n1. Visual Decomposition\n- Main visual elements: 10 rectangular photo frames arranged in a grid\n- Geometric shapes: Rectangles arranged in a 2-row, 5-column grid\n- Colors: Each photo has different colors but they're all realistic skin tones, hair colors, and clothing colors\n\n2.

Visual Decomposition\n**Main visual elements:**\n- A collection of 10 celebrity headshot photographs\n- Professional portrait-style images with various backgrounds\n- Mix of male and female subjects with different styling\n\n**Geometric shapes:**\n- 10 rectangular frames arranged in a uniform grid\n- Clean, geometric layout with no borders or gaps\n- Each rectangle has identical dimensions\n\n**Key colors and relationships:**\n- Diverse color palette from the photography\n- Warm skin tones, various hair colors (blonde, brown, dark)\n- Mix of neutral and colorful backgrounds\n- Professional lighting creates consistent brightness levels\n\n### 2. Structural Analysis\n**Arrangement and layering:**\n- 2 rows × 5 columns grid layout\n- Top row: 5 portraits\n- Bottom row: 5 portraits\n- No overlapping elements - each photo occupies its own space\n\n**Proportions and spatial relationships:**\n- Each photo appears to be approximately 1:1.2 aspect ratio (portrait orientation)\n- Equal spacing and sizing throughout\n- Total composition is roughly 5:2 aspect ratio (wide format)\n\n**Patterns and symmetry:**\n- Perfect grid symmetry\n- Consistent cropping style across all images\n- Balanced composition with variety in subjects\n\n### 3. SVG Implementation Strategy\n**SVG elements for representation:**\n- Use `<rect>` elements for each photo placeholder\n- Apply different fill colors to distinguish each image\n- Group elements for better organization\n- Use `<g>` tags for row grouping\n\n**Drawing order:**\n- Background first (if needed)\n- Grid container\n- Individual photo rectangles from left to right, top to bottom\n\n**Complex shapes and gradients:**\n- Since we're abstracting photographic content, use solid colors\n- Each rectangle will have a distinct color representing the dominant tone of each photo\n\n### 4. Technical Considerations\n**Viewport dimensions:**\n- 500×200 provides good 5:2 aspect ratio\n- ViewBox allows for scalability\n\n**Scalability:**\n- Relative units ensure responsiveness\n- Clean geometric shapes scale well\n\n**Optimizations:**\n- Minimal code structure\n- Semantic grouping\n- Efficient color palette\n\n## Complete Reasoning Process\n\nThe image is a celebrity photo collage that functions as a visual grid. To create an SVG representation, I'm abstracting the photographic content into a geometric grid using colored rectangles. Each rectangle represents one photo, with colors chosen to reflect the general tone and mood of each original image.\n\nThe grid structure is the most important element to preserve, as it defines the composition's visual impact. Using distinct colors for each \"photo\" maintains the variety and visual interest of the original while creating a clean, scalable vector representation.\n\n## Final SVG Code Implementation\n\n```svg",

The approach involves summing numbers, then applying various transformative rules to derive a consistent result. By examining max and min values, I've discovered a promising method: adding the sum, the difference between maximum and minimum values, and sometimes an additional adjustment. This technique successfully resolves several equation variations, showing potential for a generalized solution across different number combinations.</think>\n\nI'll analyze this puzzle image step by step and create an SVG representation.\n\n## Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n### 1.

  "v1_95": "<think>I'm looking at this image and need to analyze it step by step to create an SVG representation. Let me carefully examine what I can see.\n\nThe image appears to be a black and white/grayscale photograph showing what looks like a blurred or motion-blurred display or screen. I can make out some text that appears to say something but it's quite blurred and difficult to read clearly. There seems to be a rectangular display or screen in the center with some kind of interface or text on it.\n\nLet me go through the structured analysis:\n\n1. Visual Decomposition:\n- The image shows what appears to be a rectangular screen or display\n- There's significant motion blur or camera blur\n- The background is dark/black\n- The screen/display appears to be lighter colored (white/gray)\n- There appears to be text or interface elements on the screen\n- The overall image has a grayscale appearance\n\n2. Structural Analysis:\n- The main element is a rectangular screen/display positioned centrally\n- The screen appears to be tilted or at an angle\n- There are horizontal bands or sections within the screen\n- The blur creates streaking effects across the image\n- The proportions suggest a typical digital display format\n\n3.

Let me analyze this systematically:\n\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n### 1. Visual Decomposition\n- **Main elements**: A rectangular display/screen in the center\n- **Geometric shapes**: Primary rectangular form with rounded corners\n- **Colors**: Monochromatic grayscale palette - dark background with lighter display area\n- **Key relationships**: High contrast between dark surroundings and bright screen\n\n### 2. Structural Analysis\n- **Arrangement**: Central rectangular display with significant motion blur\n- **Proportions**: The screen appears to be in landscape orientation, roughly 16:10 or similar aspect ratio\n- **Layering**: Dark background layer with lighter screen layer on top\n- **Patterns**: Horizontal banding visible within the screen area, suggesting interface elements\n\n### 3. SVG Implementation Strategy\n- **Primary elements**: Rectangle for screen, gradient backgrounds for depth\n- **Drawing order**: Background first, then screen, then blur effects\n- **Complex shapes**: Use SVG filters to simulate motion blur\n- **Gradients**: Radial and linear gradients to create the lighting effect\n\n### 4. Technical Considerations\n- **Viewport**: 800x600 for good detail while remaining manageable\n- **Scalability**: Use viewBox for responsive scaling\n- **Optimizations**: Minimal filter complexity for performance\n\n## Complete Reasoning Process:\n\nThe image shows a heavily blurred digital display, likely captured with camera motion or subject movement. The blur creates streaking effects that suggest horizontal motion. The screen appears to have interface elements or text, though they're too blurred to read clearly. The lighting suggests the screen is the primary light source in a dark environment.\n\n## Final SVG Implementation:\n\n```svg",
