  "v1_0": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description of the image for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main objects, shapes, and elements\n\n- **Mathematical equation:** The only content in the image is a handwritten mathematical equation:  \n  **(X + 3)² = 4**\n- **Elements of the equation:**\n  - **Left Parenthesis**: A tall, curved, backward-“C”-shaped stroke.\n  - **X**: Two intersecting diagonal single-stroke lines forming an uppercase 'X'.\n  - **Plus Sign**: A vertical and a horizontal line intersecting at the center.\n  - **3**: A digit “3” drawn as a continuous curved double-arc.\n  - **Right Parenthesis**: Symmetrical to the left parenthesis, but facing the other way.\n  - **Exponent 2**: A small, superscripted “2” to the upper right of the right parenthesis; its baseline is well above the equation's main axis.\n  - **Equals Sign**: Two short, parallel, slightly wavy horizontal lines.\n  - **4**: A single-stroke “4” with a closed triangular internal space, drawn as a vertical stroke with a horizontal top line and a diagonal connecting the two.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, textures, and visual properties\n\n- **Color:**  \n  All elements are written in a uniform, bright neon green (#62d700 approx.).\n- **Stroke:**  \n  All symbols and text are drawn with the same thick, rounded, smooth “handwritten marker” style stroke.\n- **Texture:**  \n  The line quality is even and opaque, with smooth but slightly shaky/organic curves, mimicking actual marker or digital pen handwriting.\n- **Background:**  \n  The background is solid white (#FFFFFF).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial relationships and positioning\n\n- **Baseline:**  \n  All primary equation characters are horizontally aligned along a common baseline.\n- **Element Order and Spacing:**\n  - **Parenthesis:** The left parenthesis is at the far left; the right parenthesis closes around the \"X + 3\".\n  - **\"X + 3\":** The 'X', plus, and '3' are centered between the parentheses, evenly spaced.\n  - **Exponent \"2\":** The \"2\" is written as a superscript, above and to the right of the right parenthesis; it does **not** overlap any other symbol.\n  - **Equals sign:** Two horizontal lines, centered vertically on the baseline, to the immediate right of the superscript, with a small gap.\n  - **\"4\":** Right of the equals sign, slightly more space between '=' and '4' than between other characters.\n- **Proportions:**\n  - **Parentheses height:** Tallest elements, about 1.6 times the height of 'X' or '3', with the top and bottom curving above/below all other symbols.\n  - **Exponent \"2\":** About 0.5 the height of a regular character and sits fully above the main line, not touching any other symbol.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and artistic characteristics\n\n- **Handwritten style:**  \n  The entire equation is hand-drawn in a casual script, with organically varied line width and slight waviness in curves and straight lines.\n- **Boldness:**  \n  The stroke is relatively thick compared to the gap between symbols.\n- **Roundness:**  \n  All corners are rounded, no sharp points.\n- **Uniformity:**  \n  All symbols are in the same green color and stroke.\n- **No serifs or embellishments.**  \n  All characters are plain, with no decorations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, symbols, and specific details\n\n- **Text included:**  \n  - Uppercase \"X\"\n  - \"+\" sign\n  - Single-digit \"3\" (no loop overlap)\n  - Parentheses\n  - Superscript “2”\n  - \"=\" equals sign\n  - Digit \"4\"\n- **Symbol placement:**  \n  - The exponent \"2\" is clearly a superscript, smaller than all other symbols, and offset to the top-right of the right parenthesis.\n  - The equals sign consists of two parallel tilde-like (slightly wavy) lines, not perfectly straight.\n  - The number 4 is stylized with a closed internal triangle.\n\n---\n\n### SVG-specific geometric/layering guidelines:\n\n1. **Group the entire equation as a single <g> SVG group.**\n2. **Draw each stroke (parentheses, X, etc.) as a separate <path> or <text> element**, matching the described curvatures and stroke width (e.g., ~8-10% of the total glyph height for stroke width).\n3. **Overall layout:**  \n   - Equation *wide and horizontally centered* in the image.\n   - Place parenthesis first and last, with the equation filling the horizontal space equally.\n   - Ensure the superscript '2' is exactly above the midline of the equals sign, and raised about 3/4 of a glyph's height above the baseline.\n4. **All elements should use the same #62d700 stroke color** and no fill (except if closing the 4).\n5. **Left and right padding:**  \n   The leftmost part (left parenthesis) and the rightmost (end of the '4') should be about 5-10% of total width from the image edge.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nHandwritten mathematical equation \"(X + 3)² = 4\" in thick, round, green marker on a white background, with large, organic shapes, clear superscript on the exponent 2, and all elements aligned on a central baseline except for the exponent. The style is smooth and informal with slight waviness and no sharp edges.\n\n---\n\nIf you need any more geometric measurements or explicit SVG path pseudocode, just let me know!",

Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n\n- **Watermarks**:  \n  - The word \"alamy\" in a white semi-transparent, all-lowercase sans-serif font is repeated across the image in several locations:\n    - One in the upper left quadrant (overlaying the zebra and rocks).\n    - One in the upper right quadrant (over rocks).\n    - One in the lower left quadrant (over rocks and water).\n    - One in the lower right quadrant (over water).\n    - One in the lower right corner, smaller, overlaid and semi-transparent (the clearest, with \"alamy\").\n    - Text does **not** interact or obscure the main subjects.\n- **Other**:  \n  - No other notable symbols, logos, or signage visible.\n  - ID: \"Image ID: PPWORN\" in white, lower right corner, small size.\n\n---\n\n### **Proportions & Geometrics (for SVG Recreation)**\n\n- **Zebra**:  \n  - Length ≈ 2/3 image width, from tail tip to nose.\n  - Height ≈ 1/3 image height (ground to top of shoulder).\n  - Head: 18–20% length of the body, neck and head combined are about 40% of body length.\n  - Body oval with four slender rectangles for legs, tail as a thin curve with tuft.\n  - Stripes: evenly spaced, mostly vertical on body, horizontal/curved on rump, diagonal/angled on neck/face.\n- **Pond**:  \n  - Irregular rounded shape approx. 45% width by 30% height, lower center/right.\n  - Lightly outlined, reflective fill with a slightly blurred zebra reflection.\n- **Rocks**:  \n  - 4–5 major organic, lumpy polygons for foreground; smaller ovals/sub-rounded shapes scattered in background.\n- **Fence**:  \n  - 3–4 dark horizontal bands (rails), vertical posts behind, upper 20% of image.\n\n---\n\nIf you need the **visual description as geometric primitives or in SVG structure**, let me know!",
  "v1_112": "Certainly! Here is a detailed, SVG-oriented description of the image:\n\n1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n   - The central focus is on two people in the foreground. One person is carrying the other on their back, suggesting a piggyback position.\n   - The person doing the carrying is standing with both arms extended downward, supporting the legs of the individual on their back. The legs of the carried individual are bent at the knees and extend around the torso of the carrier.\n   - The background features an ocean shoreline meeting a sandy beach, with gentle waves and a low horizon.\n   - The sky occupies the upper third of the composition, with a bright sun near center-top, resulting in strong natural backlighting.\n\n2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n   - The color palette is dominated by blues and whites in the sky and ocean, soft beige and tan for the sand, and natural skin tones for the figures.\n   - The water has white foam at the shoreline, indicating gentle waves. The sun creates a bright, white glow and lens flare with gradual, circular fade.\n   - The sand texture at the bottom third appears smooth with slight shadowing around the figures.\n   - The individuals’ hair is distinct: one person has short, dark hair and the other has curly, voluminous hair with brown highlights.\n\n3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n   - The figures are placed in the foreground, occupying the central third vertically and horizontally, with their upper bodies extending into the middle/top third.\n   - The ocean starts about one-fourth from the bottom edge and occupies a large horizontal band, stretching fully across the width.\n   - The sun is high and slightly left of center, just above the line where the sea meets the sky.\n   - The horizon line is almost straight, broken only slightly by distant land at far left.\n   - The figures overlap, with the carried person’s torso offset slightly to the right and arms draped around the carrier’s neck and shoulders.\n\n4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n   - The image is a naturalistic, high-resolution photographic composition with strong backlighting, resulting in a subtle silhouette effect and luminous outlines around the figures.\n   - Colors are soft but bright, slightly desaturated by the sunlight, with smooth gradients in the sky and reflective highlights on the water.\n   - Visual emphasis is placed on the embrace and interaction of the two figures, with dynamic, energetic body angles.\n\n5. **Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n   - No text or graphic symbols are present.\n   - Background landmass is faint, appearing as a soft, bluish shape on the far left horizon.\n   - No objects like boats, umbrellas, or additional people are visible.\n   - The clothing of the figures: the carrier wears a short-sleeved, light-colored (white or very pale gray) T-shirt, while the carried person wears shorts and a similar-colored lightweight top.\n   - Both figures’ skin tones exhibit warm, natural hues, with sunlight creating rim-lighting effects on their hair and outlines.\n\n\n**Geometric/Proportional Notes for SVG Recreation:**\n- The main figures should be placed centered horizontally, occupying approximately 60% of the image width and from 30% (bottom) to 85% (top) of the image height.\n- The horizon line should be at roughly 38% of the total image height from the bottom edge.\n- The sun is a circle with heavy radial blur, centered about 10% from the top edge and 45% from the left edge.\n- Use polygonal approximation for arms, legs, and torso. The carrier’s torso is wider at the shoulders, slightly tapering down.\n- Create the hair of the carried individual with overlapping curly segments to form an irregular, wide, upper-right silhouette.\n\nThis structure and color description will facilitate an accurate SVG recreation of the image.",

  "v1_116": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description of the image, focused on details necessary for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Elephant:**  \n  The central and largest element is a single adult elephant, positioned facing the viewer, walking out of the ocean towards the right side foreground. Its ears are extended outward, trunk hangs down the center, slightly curved with tip turned back under itself. Both tusks are visible but short, with the left tusk more prominent.\n- **Seashore and Water:**  \n  The background consists of the ocean with breaking waves and white foam, receding in horizontal bands through the upper half of the image. The shoreline is a curving diagonal line that runs from lower left to upper right, dividing sea (left/top) from sandy beach (right/bottom).\n- **Birds:**  \n  Three small shorebirds, spaced apart, appear on the sand in the lower right quarter. They are upright, facing various directions, and each is a small, rounded body atop thin, short legs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Elephant:**  \n  -- Main color: Charcoal gray with pinkish hues inside the ears and freckling around the trunk and ears.  \n  -- Surface: Matte, rough textured skin with folds and wrinkles; visible highlights on wet areas, mainly the legs and trunk.\n- **Ocean:**  \n  -- Color: Deep blue, grading to lighter, greener-blue as it reaches the shore.  \n  -- Texture: Choppy, with white, irregular edged waves and foam. The foam forms organic, wavy shapes.\n- **Beach:**  \n  -- Color: Golden to ochre sand, with smooth gradients where wet sand meets dry, darker near the water, lighter further inland.  \n  -- Texture: Smooth with subtle, blended shading. No prominent debris.\n- **Birds:**  \n  -- Color: Brownish-gray bodies with lighter undersides, small dark beaks, and legs. Minimal detail required at this scale.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Elephant:**  \n  -- Vertically centered, but horizontally offset left of center, occupying about 1/4 the total width.  \n  -- The feet are at the water's edge, back legs still submerged. The head nearly touches the upper horizontal third.\n- **Shoreline:**  \n  -- Diagonal, slanting from the bottom left corner to the middle of the right edge, separating water (top/left) and beach (bottom/right).\n- **Birds:**  \n  -- Three birds are staggered along the dry sand, at increasing distances from the elephant, distributed along a gentle arc leading from mid-lower right towards the lower right corner.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Realistic photographic style** with naturalistic shapes and proportionate scale.\n- **No stylization or outlining.** Edges are defined by contrast, not by lines.\n- **Subtle gradients** used for shadows, contours, and water/sky transitions.\n- **Soft, blended highlights** on the elephant and the waves, with sunlight coming from upper left, subtly modeling forms.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details\n\n- **No text or artificial symbols** are present.\n- **Details for accurate reproduction:**\n  - **Elephant’s Size:**  \n    Should dominate vertical center; head takes up most of the upper center. Trunk almost forms a straight central vertical but the tip bends right.\n  - **Ear Shape:**  \n    Large, semi-triangular, with pink/gray texturing and speckling, outer curve extending from near the top of the head.\n  - **Trunk and Tusks:**  \n    Trunk is wide at the base, narrows at tip. Tusks emerge from the side of the mouth, visible as short, conical white arcs.\n  - **Wave Bands:**  \n    Irregular, repeating arcs of white, with mid-blue water between. Foam bands run horizontally.\n  - **Shoreline Curve:**  \n    A natural, S-shaped curve; not a straight line.\n  - **Birds’ Placement:**  \n    Spaced at roughly even intervals, about 1/10 the height of the elephant.\n\n---\n\n#### Proportions and Layout:\n\n- **Canvas:** Use a landscape (horizontal) rectangle, approx. 4 units wide x 3 units tall.\n- **Horizon Line:** Top third of the image. Sky occupies a small upper band.\n- **Elephant:**  \n  Height: 2/3 of canvas height, Width: 1/5 of canvas width.\n- **Each bird:**  \n  Height: 1/20 of canvas height; positioned at 1.5, 2.2, and 3 units from left edge (along bottom edge).\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nA single, front-facing adult elephant with dark, wet, textured skin and curved trunk stands at the shoreline, emerging from blue-green, choppy ocean water overlain with white foam. The boundless sea stretches to the horizon under an unobtrusive blue sky. On the golden sand, three scattered shorebirds walk, spaced to accentuate openness. The scene is realistic in style, using gradients and shading, no outlines, and emphasizes the grandeur of the elephant in context with the natural, unspoiled beach. No text, artificial markings, or stylization are present. The composition is balanced with the main mass (elephant) left of center and the small birds on the right for visual counterpoint.",

  "v1_118": "Certainly! Here is a precise and detailed description of the image above, structured to facilitate highly accurate SVG illustration.\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- **Foreground:** Horizontal blue river, covering the bottom sixth of the image. Numerous white yachts and small boats are moored along the riverside to the left.\n- **Middle Ground:** \n  - A band of green grassy parkland runs horizontally, with varied green and brown shading indicating perspective and vegetation. Several deciduous trees with brownish trunks and green canopies are scattered across the area.\n  - A row of light gray-beige, gabled-roof residential buildings (townhouse style, 2-3 stories) lines the green area, mostly at the left.\n  - Behind this, larger modern buildings and high-rises dominate the skyline. The buildings are varying in width and height, mostly rectangular and cuboid, with clearly demarcated sides.\n- **Background:**\n  - Hills with varying shades of green and tree lines are visible on the far left background.\n  - The clear sky occupies over half of the image in a uniform gradient of blue.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **River water:** Vivid blue, horizontal streaks and reflections.\n- **Green belt:** Variegated greens, fading toward yellowish near the base of the trees; brown paths and trunks.\n- **Buildings:**\n  - Predominantly white, gray, aqua-blue, and red-brown.\n  - Some glass buildings employ reflective blue glass textures, showing grid-like white or gray stripes (window divisions).\n  - The most prominent building is orange-red with horizontal pale stripes and a blue-gray pointed pyramid roof (KOIN Center).\n  - Next to it is a very tall, narrow black building with white vertical stripes along its facade (Wells Fargo Center).\n  - Shorter, blockier buildings include a stepped, reddish-brown structure (US Bancorp Tower), louvered horizontal white buildings, and cube-like glass towers.\n  - Yellow construction cranes are interspersed (three visible, mostly right of center).\n- **Style:** Photorealistic, but for SVG, use geometric forms (rectangles, triangles, ellipses) with gradients and flat fills to capture color and shadow.\n- **Sky:** Bright blue, uniform gradient (slightly darker at the zenith).\n- **Boats:** Simple white hull shapes with tall, thin masts (vertical lines), reflected in the river.\n\n**3.

  "v1_119": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description of the image, suitable for reconstruction as SVG:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Sheep:**  \n  There are three visible sheep with thick, textured wool. The two sheep in the foreground are standing and facing towards the viewer at a slight diagonal. A third sheep is lying down partially obscured behind the two standing sheep, while further wooly shapes suggest at least one more sheep lying down in the background.\n- **Feeding rack:**  \n  Above and slightly behind the standing sheep is a wooden (beige/tan colored) feeding rack holding hay. The rack is positioned diagonally from upper left to lower right, visibly slanted downward towards the right side. The rack is composed of slanted parallel slats, forming elongated parallelogram gaps.\n- **Hay:**  \n  Hay both fills the rack and is spread on the ground, with scattered pieces in front of and below the sheep.\n- **Fencing:**  \n  Behind the sheep, metal fencing painted green forms a vertical and horizontal grid/bar pattern, indicative of a pen or stall. It runs horizontally across the background.\n- **Wall:**  \n  The back and right wall is solid, painted dark green.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Sheep:**\n  - **Wool:** Light gray to off-white, shaggy, forming a rough, uneven edge at the bottom. The texture is frizzy and heavy.\n  - **Head and legs:** Black, with the face featuring a subtle gradient/light reflection on the fur, some white markings are present on the head.\n  - **Ear tags:** Small yellow rectangles attached to the sheep’s ears.\n- **Feeding rack:** Light beige-golden wood tone, with subtle shadows indicating depth and slats, forming an acute angle as it leans.\n- **Hay:** Light yellow-green, stringy, both in the rack and scattered on the floor. It has a thin, straw-like texture.\n- **Fencing:** Painted green metal, vertical and horizontal bars, smooth but slightly worn.\n- **Wall:** Flat, uniform dark green.\n- **Floor:** Covered in gold-yellow straw, thin, with uneven edges both under the sheep and background.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Foreground:**  \n  The two standing sheep occupy the center and right-center, with the left sheep standing more towards the front (right legs visible) and the right one more behind but facing forward. Both sheep are parallel and almost touching, with heads tucked under the angled rack, eating hay. Their bodies overlap slightly.  \n- **Background:**  \n  The lying sheep are mostly obstructed, visible as soft, irregular wool shapes, primarily to the lower right and midground behind the standing sheep.\n- **Top of image:**  \n  The wooden hayrack occupies the upper central part, mounted diagonally, extending from just left of center to the right side, above the sheep’s heads.\n- **Fencing and wall:**  \n  Horizontal banding in the background, above the hayrack, running from left to right edge. The dark green wall is visible behind the sheep and hayrack, taking up the upper right corner and mid-right side of the image.\n- **Floor:**  \n  The area beneath the sheep, rack, and around the pen is completely covered with straw/hay.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealistic:**  \n  The image is a photograph — not an illustration — with natural colors, organic lines, shadows, and highlights indicative of real barn lighting.\n- **Perspective:**  \n  The perspective is eye-level, close to the animals, slightly angled so that the left side of the image is slightly closer than the right.\n- **Proportions:**  \n  - **Sheep:** Each sheep is roughly a vertical oval for the body (about 1:1.3 width to height ratio), with thinner cylindrical legs extending downward. The heads are triangular, with white or gray “caps” on the faces.\n  - **Feeding rack:** About 2/3 the width of the image, 1/5 the height, slanted at approximately 30–35°.\n  - **Fencing/Wall:** The fencing is a band approximately 1/5 of the image height, near the top.\n  - **Floor:** Straw covers about 1/3–1/2 the bottom of the image.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **No visible text** in the scene.\n- **Ear tags:**  \n  On both standing sheep are small yellow rectangular tags on each ear, sometimes with tiny (unreadable) numbers or symbols commonly used in livestock identification.\n- **Sheep facial markings:**  \n  The sheep have black faces, with pale “caps” and some have white markings near the muzzle and above the eyes.\n- **Feeding rack:**  \n  Each slat is a parallelogram/rectangle, evenly spaced, forming a pattern of negative space.\n- **Hay details:**  \n  The hay is represented by thin, curving lines (SVG: random overlapping lines and clusters for organic texture).\n- **Shadows:**  \n  Gentle, soft-edged shadows are visible under the sheep and rack.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary for SVG Construction**\n\n- **Main shapes:** Ovals for sheep bodies, bent lines for legs, triangles/pear shapes for heads, rectangles/parallelograms for hayrack slats, rectangles for fencing bars.\n- **Color palette:** Light gray/off-white (wool), black (legs/heads/faces), yellow (tags, hay), green (fence, wall), tan/beige (rack).\n- **Layering:**  \n  - Background: Wall + fencing band\n  - Middle: Hayrack, hay\n  - Foreground: Sheep (centered), scattered hay/hay texture\n\nThis comprehensive breakdown should allow accurate reconstruction of the given farm scene as an SVG.

  "v1_130": "Certainly! Here is a detailed, SVG-oriented description of the image, excluding the blurred face:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Elephant**: Dominates the composition, occupying about 65% of both height and width, oriented in left profile. The elephant is shown mid-stride, with the front left leg lifted and trunk gently curving downward. The head is slightly lower than the back, with a distinct ear and visible eye.\n- **Person**: Seated centrally atop the elephant, straddling its neck just in front of the withers. The figure wears a wide-brimmed straw hat and blue clothing—loose shirt and pants. Hands rest on knees.\n- **Elephant Accessories**: Broad brown strap runs horizontally around the elephant’s midsection; another, thinner tether leads from the left side forward out of frame, diagonal to lower right. A padded, textured brown and black blanket/saddle is placed on the back, under the person.\n- **Flags**: Two vertical flagpoles on the right, with the Thai tricolor (red, white, and blue stripes) and a bright yellow flag.\n- **Background Elements**: Abundant green foliage forms the upper two-thirds. The river runs horizontally in the mid-ground. Trees with defined trunks are along the left and mid-right, one in the foreground (left), one behind elephant’s back, and both vertical.\n- **Ground**: Flat, light-brown dirt surface, transitioning to some green grassy areas near the river. Light patches and footprints are visible near the elephant’s feet.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Elephant**: Main body is a cool, dark grey with soft textural highlights. Subtle creases around knees, trunk, and ear. Lighter shading on the trunk’s underside and ear’s edge.\n- **Person**: Clothing is mid-blue, with the shirt slightly lighter than pants. Hat is pale tan/brown, with a visible woven texture and dark brown shadow at the crown.\n- **Accessories**: The belly strap is textured, warm brown; saddle blanket is dark brown/black, with shaggy edges.\n- **Flags**:\n  - *Left*: Red, white, blue striped (vertical).\n  - *Right*: Solid yellow, both on slim white poles.\n- **Foliage**: Various shades of green, predominantly deep and cool, with lighter, yellow-green highlights in sunlit areas.\n- **Ground**: Muted ochre and beige; damp areas have slightly darker brown tones.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Elephant**:\n  - Roughly three-quarters within the frame from left to right.\n  - Body tilts gently forward, trunk dropping near lower left quadrant.\n  - Left front leg raised, showing mid-step.\n- **Person**:\n  - Centered over the elephant’s shoulders, roughly 1/3 down from top of image, seated upright.\n- **Straps and Blanket**:\n  - Blanket centrally placed; strap diagonally wraps body in a ‘V’ shape, with upper anchor point behind the seating area.\n- **Flags**:\n  - Located in background, upper right quadrant.\n  - Positioned vertically, spaced evenly.\n- **Trees**:\n  - One foreground tree trunk on left edge (vertical, 10% width from border).\n  - Another tree behind elephant, serrated leaves above.\n- **River**:\n  - Stretches horizontally in the mid-ground, about 1/4 height from the bottom.\n  - Water surface is smooth, muted green.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealistic**, high detail in elephant skin, tree textures, and clothing folds.\n- Colors are naturalistic with slightly heightened saturation, especially in greenery.\n- Soft shadows and sunlight create varied highlight effects on elephant’s back and under belly.\n- Perspective is at standing eye-level, slightly from the right of the elephant.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **Flags**: Distinct patterns:\n  - *Thai Flag*: Five horizontal stripes (red-white-blue-white-red, with blue stripe twice the width).\n  - *Yellow Flag*: Solid fill, no visible emblem at this scale.\n- **No other visible text or symbols** on the elephant, accessories, or in the environment.\n- **Proportions**:\n  - Elephant body: Oval/rectangular, occupying 60–70% of width and about 50% of the height.\n  - Person: About 1:7 scale relative to the elephant.\n  - Trees: Full height, trunks about 5% of total width each.\n  - Flags: Poles about 1.5 times elephant’s height; flags themselves rectangular, with ratio approximately 2:3.\n\n---\n\n#### Additional SVG-Relevant Details\n\n- **Elephant Outline**: Smooth curves with defined ear outline, three toe nails visible on lifted foot, tail visible at rear.\n- **Person**: Hat is a roughly oval ellipse with a smaller arc for the crown; shirt sleeves end at elbows, pants tucked loosely.\n- **Straps**: Belt diagonally overlapping the elephant’s body, breaks at junction points.\n- **Background**: River is horizontal rectangular band, with near-shore line contour.\n\n---\n\nThis comprehensive breakdown offers key geometric, proportional, and layout information for accurate SVG image reconstruction.",

  "v1_149": "Certainly! Here’s a detailed and technical description of the image excerpting any reference to blurred faces:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- The image is a four-panel meme, arranged as a 2x2 grid, with a title above.\n- Each panel contains a photo representing one of four subjects: Zoom, Teacher, Wifi company, and Students.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- The overall background is white, giving strong contrast to the photo panels and black text.\n- Text is in a clean, black, sans-serif font, bold for titles.\n- Each quadrant contains a photographic image with a distinct setting and dominant color palette:\n  - Top left: Features a person in a black suit with arms raised, surrounded by a flurry of floating U.S. dollar bills, against a pale background dominated by the green and off-white of the cash.\n  - Top right: Depicts a person in a striped, dark top, leaning back relaxed with hands behind their head, in an office or classroom setting with neutral tones (grey, white, beige).\n  - Bottom left: Another suited figure, arms outstretched, more floating U.S. bills all around; the background shows an outdoor or possibly digital backdrop with blue sky and green land.\n  - Bottom right: Features a person wearing a red jacket and yellow vest, standing indoors. The foreground has pink handwritten text on glass (“Put on a happy f-”), under soft yellow and brown lighting.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- The panels are evenly spaced in a 2x2 grid.\n- The top row is labeled “Zoom” (left) and “Teacher” (right).\n- The bottom row is “Wifi company” (left) and “Students” (right).\n- Each subject is centered inside their respective rectangular panel.\n- The cash in the top left and bottom left panels appears to radiate outward from the figure’s body, suggesting abundance.\n- The text in the bottom right (students) is written directly on the glass in front of the person and is large enough to dominate the foreground.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The style is photo-collage for humor/meme effect; photographic realism in images.\n- The title “Studying online” appears at the top, large and centered, with a margin above the grid.\n- The black labeling above each panel is smaller than the title but still bold and clear for quick association.\n- Visual humor derives from the juxtaposition of content (e.g., money flying for companies vs. a somber, chaotic student panel).\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Title**: At the very top, in single line: \"Studying online\"\n- **Panel Labels**: Centered above each photo: “Zoom”, “Teacher”, “Wifi company”, “Students”. \n- **Money Panels** (Zoom & Wifi company):\n  - Numerous U.S. dollar bills (visually $1, $20, $100) illustrated as flying, mid-air, at various angles and overlapping.\n  - Both figures are depicted from the waist up, arms lifted, as if celebrating the money.\n- **Teacher Panel**:\n  - A horizontal, rectangular composition.\n  - Figure is leaning back at a desk or table, with hands intertwined behind head, exuding a relaxed posture.\n  - Desk or table is scattered with blurry, indistinct items in the foreground for depth.\n- **Student Panel**:\n  - A pane of clear glass or acrylic separates viewer from person.\n  - “Put on a happy f-” is written in large, uneven strokes with pink lipstick or marker on the glass.\n  - The person is standing straight, wearing a red blazer, possibly referencing the “Joker” film character (yellow vest, stark contrasting colors).\n  - Warm indoor lighting, with lamp and subtle wood grain visible in the background.\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, Layout:**\n- The 2x2 grid is equally divided: each panel is a square or nearly-square.\n- Spacing between panels is minimal but defined.\n- The title sits above the grid, centered, with enough vertical padding to visually separate it from the panel labels.\n- Panel labels are centered above each image, no bordering or boxing between panels.\n- Each person is roughly centered within their panel; cash/money effects and handwritten text help fill each frame for visual balance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Panel         | Subject      | Main Visuals                                                       | Dominant Colors     | Foreground Detail        |\n|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| Top Left      | Zoom         | Suit-clad figure, arms up, raining money, white/green background   | Black, white, green | Flying/falling bills     |\n| Top Right     | Teacher      | Relaxed figure at desk, hands behind head, window background       | Grey, white, beige  | Desk, office objects     |\n| Bottom Left   | Wifi company | Suit figure, arms wide, more flying money, blue sky background     | Black, blue, green  | Flying/falling bills     |\n| Bottom Right  | Students     | Red-jacketed figure behind glass with pink text (“Put on a happy f-”) | Red, yellow, pink    | Handwritten pink text    |\n\n**SVG construction notes:**  \n- Four equal-sized squares in a 2x2 grid, each with photographic image (or photographic-styled drawing).\n- Ensure monetary notes in two panels have a scattered, erratic layout around the suited figures.\n- Text on glass in Student panel should have uneven, lipstick-like strokes for authenticity.\n- Use clear, bold sans-serif font centered above each panel for labels and larger, top-center for main title.\n\nLet me know if you need this in a table format or as a step-by-step SVG construction guide!",

Placed on a white background with faint grid-like paper lines.\n- **Lined Paper Lines:** Light blue horizontal lines; each writing section shows 2–3 lines of ruled paper.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning:**\n\n- **Overall layout:** Image is vertically oriented, divided cleanly into three main horizontal panels. Each handwriting sample aligns below its respective label.\n- **Bands:** Equal thickness, spanning the width of the image.\n- **Text within bands:** Centered, all-caps for section labels, upper-case/lower-case mix for the title.\n- **Handwriting samples:** Margin of white or pale blue paper visible above and below text; text is centered within its writing area horizontally, with even side margins.\n- **ECG Line:** Sits within the lower writing area, not crossing the section’s edges, with even white space above and below.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics:**\n\n- **Font (labels):** Clean, sans-serif, bold (likely Arial/Helvetica or similar).\n- **Handwriting (first section):** Legible cursive, letters connected, regular letter height and spacing, text nearly parallel to ruled paper lines.\n- **Handwriting (middle section):** Messier cursive, larger and less regular, some letters blending together, text slants more, overlaps or touches lines above/below.\n- **ECG line:** Uniform thinness, mechanical/medical style, unlike natural handwriting, with sharp peaks and valleys.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, symbols, specific details:**\n\n- **Header:** \n  - Text: \"My Handwriting In Exams\"\n  - Font: Sans-serif, black, bold, centered at very top, largest text size.\n- **First black band:** \n  - Text: \"First two pages\"\n- **Second black band:** \n  - Text: \"Middle pages\"\n- **Third black band:** \n  - Text: \"Last two pages\"\n\n- **Handwriting sample 1 (first two pages):**\n  - Clearly reads: \"Global warming is definitely a very huge issue in front of this entire world. It's causing several disturbances in the\"\n- **Handwriting sample 2 (middle pages):**\n  - Less legible, appears to start: \"Also it's causing the melt down of gla... and making the ocean wate...\" etc. Text overlaps, letters less distinct.\n- **Handwriting sample 3 (last two pages):**\n  - No handwriting—replaced by a single thin black/gray ECG trace line, sharply zigzagging horizontally.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric details, proportions, layout specifics:**\n\n- **Image aspect:** About 3:4 vertical rectangle, i.e., taller than wide.\n- **Band height:** Each black band is about 12–14% of section height.\n- **Handwriting area:** Each fills roughly 60–65% of a section’s height.\n- **Margins:** Consistent spacing on all edges; black bands touch left/right edges, but handwriting and ECG have white/paper margins on left/right.\n- **Text (labels):** Height about 60% of band height, fully centered.\n- **Lined paper:** Horizontal lines equally spaced, parallel, faint blue, 3 per handwriting section.\n- **ECG area:** Line is centered vertically in its section; amplitude occupies 60–70% of area height.\n- **SVG recreation:** Use rectangles for bands, add text (centered), overlay handwriting/ECG as hand-drawn or path elements, and include subtle horizontal lines for paper.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Section        | Top Label Text       | Main Content                     | Layout Notes                        |\n|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Header         | \"My Handwriting...\"  | (Nothing in white background)     | Centered at top                     |\n| Section 1      | \"First two pages\"   | Neat blue cursive, 2 lines        | White lined paper (3 faint lines)   |\n| Section 2      | \"Middle pages\"      | Messy blue cursive, 2 lines       | White lined paper (3 faint lines)   |\n| Section 3      | \"Last two pages\"    | ECG-style line, no handwriting    | White \"paper\", grid/lines           |\n\n---\n\nThis description covers all required aspects for an SVG replica: object/shape layout, spatial relations, text labels and formatting, line style and sample text, as well as details for lined paper and band separations.",

Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- Background: Plain, solid white (#FFFFFF).\n- Head and shoulder area: Solid, filled black (#000000) with no gradation or shading.\n- Hair strands: Black lines, thinner than the outline of the head.\n- All text: Solid black, using a standard sans-serif, bold font for clarity.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- The bottom of the head is cut off, as if resting on the bottom edge of the oval, merging transitionally into the black shoulder area.\n- The oval head occupies roughly the central third of the image horizontally and the lower third vertically.\n- Hair strands emerge from the center-top of the head, fanning slightly rightward and leftward with waviness.\n- Text is centrally aligned, directly below the head and shoulder area, with visible separation between the two lines for legibility.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The drawing is minimalist and cartoon-like, with exaggerated simplicity.\n- No facial features or details are present except for the hair strands.\n- The overall look is a humorous or meme-like black-and-white cartoon, characteristic of quick digital sketches or doodles.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- There are two lines of Chinese text:\n    - Line 1: “除了睡觉时间不想睡觉”\n    - Line 2: “其他时间都想睡觉”\n- Meaning: “Except for sleep time, I don't want to sleep; at other times, I want to sleep.”\n- The font size of the text is relatively large and bold, visually balancing the head above.\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout for SVG:**\n- Canvas: Recommended aspect ratio close to 1:1.1 (height slightly larger than width).\n- Head shape: Centered oval, width roughly 60% of canvas, height about 35% of canvas.\n- Shoulder area: Extends laterally from the bottom third of the oval, rounding off smoothly and merging with the head’s outline.\n- Hair: Three wavy lines, each approximately 1/10 canvas width, curving gently to left, right, and upward.\n- Text: Each line occupies about 80% of the canvas width, stacked with equal vertical margins between head, first line, and second line.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides all necessary details for a precise SVG recreation of the image and its visual arrangement, focusing solely on structural and graphic elements.",

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The main subject is a grotesque, surreal rendition of a panda's face, rendered in a highly simplified and high-contrast manner.\n- The face fills almost the entire frame, cropped closely.\n- The panda face consists of:\n  - Two round, almost perfectly circular eyes, positioned wide apart.\n  - Two solid-black, symmetrical semicircles (ears) at the top left and top right, touching the edge of the image.\n  - A large, oval-shaped white facial area, with the outside edges forming a rounded head shape.\n  - The lower half of the face is dominated by an exaggerated open mouth, drawn in high-contrast black and white, showing upper and lower teeth, and a large, dark cavity.\n  - Above the mouth are two small, black nostrils.\n- The whole composition is heavily stylized for meme or surreal effect.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- The image is strictly monochrome (black and white only, no grays; some slight gradient artifacts may exist due to compression, but the intention is stark binary contrast).\n- The white areas (head/face) are flat, solid white, while the ears, eyes, inside of the mouth, and nostrils are deep, solid black.\n- There is no gradation or shading, only hard, sharp-edged shapes.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The face is centrally positioned and cropped tightly against both the left and right edges of the image.\n- Eyes: Small black circles, widely spaced horizontally, located in the upper third of the face (about 1/4 of the way from each side, horizontally; about 1/5 from the top, vertically).\n- Ears: Left and right, touching top corners of the image, are large semicircles partly cropped by the frame.\n- Nose: Just below the eyes, two tiny dots spaced closely together (like a colon).\n- Mouth: Occupies the entire lower third of the face, stretching horizontally almost from edge to edge. The mouth is essentially an ellipse, open very wide in an almost scream-like expression, showing rectangular teeth (upper and lower, white on black background).\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The style is surreal, meme-like, and intentionally disturbing.\n- The design relies on high contrast, minimal details, and exaggerated facial features to achieve a humorous and unsettling effect.\n- The presentation ignores anatomical accuracy, reflecting a blend of cartoon simplification and grotesque exaggeration.\n- The shapes are all regular geometric forms (circles, ovals, ellipses, rectangles).\n- No background is visible; the entire backdrop is the white facial area, filling the frame.\n\n**5.

Main objects, shapes, and elements**\n- The central subject is a close-up, front-facing photo of a domestic cat’s head and upper body.\n- The cat has its mouth wide open, with the mouth taking up a large, exaggerated oval shape in the center-bottom of the image.\n- Inside the mouth, there is white Chinese text (\"妈!\").\n- The cat’s head shape is rounded, with visible ears at the top.\n- There are stylized blue motion/teardrop lines extending from both of the cat’s eyes, representing cartoonish tears.\n\n**2. Colors, textures, and visual properties**\n- The cat’s fur is primarily white, with black patches—most notably, its left ear (on the right side in the image) is entirely black; some black fur is visible on the forehead and the top/back of the head.\n- Nose is a pale pink, positioned above the mouth and below or between the eyes.\n- The mouth interior is dark (deep brown or black) and fades slightly purple or pink toward the lips. The open mouth dominates the center of the image.\n- The tears are bright, opaque blue lines with a slight curve to each, simulating cartoon crying.\n- The eyes are closed, and the fur has a soft texture, with subtle shading for depth.\n- The background is plain, light gray.\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning**\n- The cat is centered in the square frame, with the open mouth taking up roughly the central third horizontally, and the lower half vertically.\n- The mouth oval is approximately 1/3 the width of the image, horizontally centered, and overlaps down to the lower edge of the chin.\n- Each ear points diagonally outward, situated at the top corners; the left ear (right side of the image) is mostly light with a black tip, while the right ear (left side of the image) is almost fully black.\n- Cartoon tears originate from the outer edges of the closed eyes, flowing diagonally downward and outward, covering the upper sides of the cat’s cheeks.\n- The Chinese text “妈!” (white, bold) is centered within the open mouth.\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics**\n- The photo exaggerates the outline and emptiness of the open mouth for a comedic, meme-like effect, possibly digitally altered to be larger than natural.\n- The tears are overlaid cartoon-style, simple curved blue lines without gradient.\n- Thick, smooth lines or feathered photo edges separate features (e.g., mouth, nose, ears).\n- The text is bold and clean, sans-serif, pure white, with a slight shadow for legibility.\n\n**5. Any text, symbols, or specific details**\n- The only text is the white Chinese character combination “妈!” which means “Mom!” or “Mother!” in English.\n- The text is centered and sized to fit within the open mouth, with equal spacing above and below.\n- No additional symbols present.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric / Proportional & Layout Details:**\n\n- **Canvas:** Square (e.g., 180x183px in original, use 1:1 for SVG).\n- **Cat’s Face:** Centered, face fills about 80% of width/height.\n- **Ears:** Each ear is triangular, the length from center to tip is about 1/4 of the face height.\n- **Eyes:** Closed, barely visible lines/creases, spaced symmetrically about a mouth-width apart, at upper third of face.\n- **Mouth:** Entered at the midpoint horizontally, main axis slightly tilted. Vertical oval; width ~1/3 canvas, height almost 1/3-1/2 canvas.\n- **Text \"妈!\":** Centered inside the oval, font size is about 1/3 of the mouth’s height.\n- **Tears:** Each side: ~5-7 curved blue lines, each about 1/5 the width of the canvas, radiating outward/diagonally down.\n- **Background:** Solid color (very light gray).\n\n---\n\nThis description should provide all necessary information for an SVG recreation, including key objects, spatial positioning, proportions, colors, and stylized elements.",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Pie Placement:**\n    - The pie is centered horizontally in the image, with the top crust dominating the view.\n    - The wooden rack is partially visible beneath the pie, with slats running mostly horizontally.\n- **Lattice Strips:**\n    - The lattice is composed of about seven strips running horizontally and vertically.\n    - The strips are evenly spaced, creating a grid of square/rectangular holes through which the filling shows.\n    - The strips are about 1/8 to 1/6 of the pie's diameter in width (roughly 7–8% of the diameter per strip).\n    - The strips are interlaced: horizontal strips go over, then under, each vertical strip, creating a woven pattern.\n    - Visible fruit filling is concentrated toward the holes created by the lattice.\n- **Crust Edge:**\n    - The border is irregular and wavy, sticking out slightly over the pie tin's edge, forming an undulating ring.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Photorealistic:** The overall style is photorealistic with natural colors and lighting.\n- **Composition:** Top-down view, almost perpendicular but with a slight angle from above (northwest).\n- **No added drawing or illustrative features; all elements are naturally rendered.\n- **Organic Geometry:** Both the edge and lattice strips are uneven, wavy, and hand-formed, not regular or perfectly symmetrical.\n- **No visible artificial patterns, symbols, or decorative motifs apart from the scalloped edge and lattice.\n\n**5. Any Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n\n- **No text** or symbols present anywhere.\n- **Key Details for SVG Reproduction:**\n    - **Shape and Proportion:** Circle for the overall pie; slightly undulating/sinusoidal path for the edge.\n    - **Lattice:** About 7 strips each way, with even spacing, each strip ~1/8 the diameter wide, and wavy/fluted edges created by a zigzag line.\n    - **Crust edge:** Follows a repeating wavy path (scalloped), amplitude about 2–3% of pie diameter.\n    - **Filling:** Random, organic shapes (irregular circles and blobs) peeking out of the lattice openings, red with shiny highlights.\n    - **Shading and gradients:** Base colors are tan/brown/yellow with deeper browns for crisped areas; reds with light spots for filling; may use subtlest of gradients for realism.\n    - **Pie Placement:** Centered over wooden rack; rack visible as several straight horizontal rectangles beneath.\n\n---\n\n**Sample SVG Structure** (for visual planning, not SVG code):\n\n- `<ellipse>` for the base (pie tin, if visible).\n- `<path>` for undulating pie crust edge.\n- `<rect>` or `<path>` for lattice strips (wavy fluted edges).\n- `<ellipse>` and `<blob>` shapes for the visible fruit filling.\n- `<rect>` for cooling rack slats beneath.\n- No text or icons.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want step-by-step SVG code guidance for this pie image!",
  "v1_162": "Certainly! Here is a precise, detailed description of the image:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- The image prominently features a stack of egg rolls or spring rolls. There are at least seven egg rolls visible.\n- Each egg roll is a thick, cylindrical or slightly rectangular-shaped tube, with rounded edges and a roughly consistent girth along its length.\n- The egg rolls are stacked on top of one another, mostly forming two layers.\n- They rest on a white napkin or paper towel, which absorbs excess oil and partially frames the lower portion of the image.\n- The background includes a brown, wooden surface (likely a table or countertop) visible in the upper left and lower right corners, partially obscured by the napkin and egg rolls.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- The egg rolls have a golden-brown to deep-brown color, indicating they are fried. The color is not uniform; some areas are more deeply fried, with some small, darker brown spots.\n- Their surfaces are dimpled and slightly bumpy, showing characteristic bubbles and uneven textures, indicative of crispiness.\n- The texture appears crunchy and well-fried, with visible patches where oil has enhanced the color.\n- The napkin/paper towel is plain white, soft, slightly crinkled, and absorbs some oil stains visible beneath the egg rolls.\n- The background wood is medium brown with visible wood grain and a mild gloss.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- The egg rolls are arranged semi-randomly, stacked in a loose pile so that some are parallel, while others are placed at slight angles to each other.\n- The majority align horizontally, but some are slightly diagonal.\n- The egg rolls dominate the central portion of the image, occupying almost the entire frame in two layers; the bottom-most layer is mostly covered, with just the edges and parts peeking out.\n- The napkin is underneath the pile; only corners and edges of it are visible along the bottom and right sides of the stack.\n- The wooden tabletop appears at the top left corner and bottom right, bracketing the white napkin and egg rolls.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- The image appears to be a straightforward, naturalistic, close-up photograph (not stylized artwork or digital rendering).\n- There is no deliberate stylization, abstraction, or artistic filter applied.\n- The composition is top-down, at a slight angle rather than perfectly overhead.\n- Lighting is soft and ambient, likely indoor, not causing harsh shadows.\n- The framing is tight, bringing attention almost exclusively to the food with minimal background.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n\n- There is no visible text or symbols present in the image.\n- Details to note: Each egg roll is roughly a rounded rectangle, about 3–4 times longer than it is wide (estimate width to length at around 1:3.5).\n- Edges of wrappers are visible, with some seams slightly separating or curling, and one or two have a partially exposed end where the filling might be slightly visible.\n- The napkin is folded, subtle creases and absorbent dots may be visible if recreated in detail.\n- At the very bottom, in the lower right, a corner of the wood surface can be seen more clearly.\n\n---\n\n**SVG Reproduction Tips (Geometric/Positional):**\n\n- Arrange 7–8 rounded rectangles with variable orientations, stacked in 2 layers, some partially obscured, at slightly diagonal angles.\n- Use a golden-to-brown gradient for each rectangle, noise or dot patterns for bubble texture.\n- Add a white polygon (napkin base) under the stack, extending beneath them with soft, irregular edges and subtle gray oil marks.\n- Add two background polygons (medium brown wood) at the upper left and lower right to define the surface.\n- If including wrapper seams: Indicate with narrow lines or slight curves at the short ends of the rectangles.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarifications or details!",
  "v1_163": "Certainly! Here is a detailed, SVG-focused description of the image:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n\n- The image displays a batch of round, sandwich-style cookies on a flat surface. There are at least eight cookies visibly in focus, several partially cropped or out of the frame.\n- Each cookie is a nearly perfect circle (diameter ≈ 50-60% of the height of each cookie), about twice as wide as its height, and has a smooth, domed top surface.\n- The cookies are individually decorated with small, flat sprinkles or confetti, distributed unevenly on the tops. There appear to be two main sprinkle types:\n  - **Colored round discs** (flat circles, ≈2-3mm diameter) in green, red, and white.\n  - **Small green tree shapes** (roughly triangular, uneven but still recognizable as stylized trees, ≈3-5mm high).\n  - (Upper center left) One cookie shows additional rod-shaped sprinkles (≈8-12mm long, thin, “jimmies”) in red, green, and white.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n\n- **Cookies:** Smooth, uniform, medium milk-chocolate brown coating. The surface has a gentle gloss, possibly from a chocolate or candy melt coating. Some minor pooling at the cookie bases.\n- **Sprinkles:** Bright, solid colors:\n  - Red: classic, medium-bright tone.\n  - Green: standard, medium-saturated, typical “holiday” green.\n  - White: solid, bright white.\n- **Background:** The surface beneath the cookies is a cool, semi-matte gray, likely wax or parchment paper. Slight parchment-like texture, but generally smooth.\n- **Texture:** Cookies are visually smooth, with minor drips or puddling at the base from chocolate coating. Sprinkles slightly raised atop the cookies.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- Cookies are loosely grouped, overlapping the frame edge on the left and top; all are viewed at a roughly 45-degree angle from above, giving a partial side view and perspective depth.\n- Most cookies sit flat, spaced about 1-2 cookie widths apart, not overlapping.\n- The closest cookie (bottom center) is largest, indicating it is nearest the viewer due to perspective. Cookies diminish slightly in size toward the rear and upper corners.\n- Sprinkles are distributed randomly on each cookie, covering 40–70% of the top surface. One cookie (bottom center) is covered mostly with green tree-shaped sprinkles, while others use a mix of red/green/white dots and rods.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic, no stylization**. The image is clearly a photograph with soft, natural lighting—no harsh shadows but visible highlights.\n- **Simple layout**, casual and unarranged, as if placed randomly on a tray to cool.\n- **No borders or artificial elements**; just the cookies and parchment/wax paper background.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n\n- **No text present** anywhere in the image.\n- **Symbols:** Only the green Christmas tree-shaped sprinkles function as icons or symbols, otherwise all decoration is abstract dots and lines.\n- **Proportions:** Each cookie is about 95–100% circular, 2:1 diameter-to-thickness ratio, with a visible sandwich “layer” at the midpoint (implied by a subtle contour/shadow).\n- The green tree sprinkles are irregular but all point “up” relative to the cookie orientation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for SVG Reproduction:**\n\n- Draw at least 8 circles, 2:1 diameter to thickness, brown fill (milk chocolate color: #8B5B2B or similar).\n- Add small pools at each base to show dripping chocolate (subtle brown ellipses).\n- Scatter small circles (2–3mm) and a few rods (1x8mm rectangles, slightly rounded ends) in red (#D72626), green (#41B619), and white (#FFFFFF) randomly on each cookie.\n- For select cookies (mostly two), cover tops in small, irregular triangular blobs in green, to mimic tree shapes.\n- Space the cookies irregularly apart, no overlap.\n- Add a medium-light gray (#CDCDCD) rectangle background, with very slight texture if possible.\n- Camera/viewing angle: Draw cookies in perspective, with the largest cookie at lower center, others receding with a 1.3:1 foreshortening toward the upper edge.\n- No text, no lines/borders, all soft-edged and naturalistic.\n\n---\n\nIf you need further breakdowns for paths, layering, or a schematic layout of sprinkle placements, let me know!",

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Main Focus:** A pile of cooked broccoli florets and baby carrots arranged centrally on a rectangular white ceramic platter.\n    - **Broccoli Florets:** Roughly 20-25 in various sizes, with thick branched stalks and rounded, textured tops.\n    - **Baby Carrots:** Around 15-18 pieces, generally small, cylindrical, rounded at both ends, and scattered amongst the broccoli.\n    - **Platter:** Rectangular, white, with rounded corners and placed at a diagonal tilting from the lower left (closest to the viewer) to the upper right of the image.\n- **Background:** Plain white, no discernible texture or shading.\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Broccoli:**\n    - **Florets:** Multiple shades of green; tops are deep to medium green, stalks are paler with a hint of yellowish-green.\n    - **Texture:** Surfaces appear rough and bumpy due to the tightly-packed buds; stalks are smooth and firm.\n    - **Visual Highlight:** Food appears slightly glossy (as if lightly coated in oil or butter).\n- **Carrots:**\n    - **Color:** Bold, saturated orange.\n    - **Texture:** Smooth, with slight glistening highlights indicating moisture or a coating.\n- **Platter:**\n    - **Color:** Solid white with gentle shading at the bottom left (indicating the lighting source from upper right).\n    - **Surface:** Smooth, glossy, reflective.\n- **Coating:** Both vegetables show a subtle, semi-transparent sheen (likely from a glaze, oil, or butter) with reflections of white light.\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Arrangement:** Vegetables are mounded in the center of the platter. Most of the pile stays within the dish bounds but some pieces are near or touching its edges. The mound stretches diagonally from bottom left (closest) to top right (furthest).\n- **Broccoli Placement:** Larger florets are primarily central, with smaller offshoots and broken pieces at the edges of the mound.\n- **Carrot Placement:** Interspersed through the heap, not laid out in a single layer — some partially hidden by florets, others on top.\n- **Platter Position:** Occupies most of the image area, with visible empty margins at all four sides; oriented so its longer sides run from bottom left to upper right.\n- **Depth:** The mound has visible dimensionality; lower left edge appears closer to the viewer, upper right recedes.\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealistic:** Strong emphasis on realistic shapes, colors, shading, and reflections.\n- **No Outlines:** Individual objects are defined by color contrast and shadow, not by black outlines.\n- **Shading and Highlights:** Light appears to come from the upper right, casting soft shadows mainly towards the lower left, creating gentle three-dimensionality.\n- **Absence of Background Detail:** Only the food and serving dish are present; no utensils or environmental elements.\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **Text:** None present.\n- **Symbols:** None.\n- **Details for Accurate Reproduction:**\n    - **Broccoli Flora Geometry:** Each floret is bounded by irregular, lobular outlines; average width per floret is about 1/8 to 1/6 the width of the platter; stalks visible on many of them.\n    - **Carrot Geometry:** Each carrot is a cylinder, 2–3 times longer than its diameter, with gradual rounding at ends. Carrots are smaller than most broccoli florets but larger than tiny broken pieces.\n    - **Distribution:** Broccoli likely covers 60% of the visible mound, carrots about 40%.\n    - **Gloss/Coating:** Reflective highlights can be indicated as thin white polygons or curved gradients along the tops of vegetables, roughly 5–10% the area of each piece.\n\n---\n\n**Tip for SVG Construction:**\n- Use grouped, irregular green shapes (with lighter green branching \"stalk\" extensions) for broccoli.\n- Use rounded, smooth, elongated orange shapes for carrots, layered and overlapped randomly with the broccoli pieces.\n- Overlay soft, semi-transparent white highlights to suggest gloss.\n- The white plate is a large, rounded rectangle beneath the vegetables.\n- Entire image sits on a white background.\n\nLet me know if you need anything translated into SVG code or want a schematic!",

  "v1_168": "Certainly. Here is a detailed and accurate description, suitable for recreating this scene as an SVG:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n\n- **Foreground Figure:**  \n  - A person is seated on the ground, leaning back against a rough, horizontally-oriented surface (likely a low brick wall or ledge).\n  - The individual's arms are extended forward, bent at the elbows, with hands loosely clasped together in front of their knees.\n  - The person is wearing a white sleeveless tank top and loose, somewhat rugged blue denim jeans. The setting and clothing suggest a casual or possibly work-related scenario.\n  - The posture is relaxed but introspective: knees are bent and pointed up, arms resting atop the knees.\n\n- **Background Structures:**  \n  - The individual is positioned against a rectangular stone or concrete ledge, with a coarse, grainy surface texture.\n  - Behind and rising from the ledge are metal railings or rods. One prominent vertical rod is on the left third of the image, attached to a horizontal metal plate with bolts or rivets.\n  - Two diagonal rods extend backward from the plate, creating a dynamic angle crossing the background.\n\n- **Additional Elements:**  \n  - The wall beneath the ledge is composed of dark, aged bricks.\n  - The background also includes a softly blurred distant structure, likely another wall or building, rendered in muted brownish tones.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n\n- **Colors:**  \n  - The color palette is naturalistic and subdued:  \n    - Skin tones: pale with slightly sun-kissed or tanned highlights.\n    - Tank top: off-white with shadowed areas.\n    - Jeans: faded blue with worn, dirt-stained areas.\n    - Ledge: slate gray with light and dark patches, consistent with weather-exposed concrete.\n    - Metal rods/plate: rusty, with dark brown to orange-red hues, indicating corrosion.\n    - Brick wall: deep brown, purple, and blackened bricks with rough mortar lines.\n    - Distant background: muted reddish-brown, soft due to defocused depth of field.\n\n- **Textures:**  \n  - Skin: smooth but slightly sweaty, with a sheen visible on arms and neck.\n  - Tank top: soft fabric, slightly wrinkled.\n  - Jeans: coarse, with visible seams and folds, hinting at denim’s weave.\n  - Ledge: pitted, gritty, with visible aggregate and weather stains.\n  - Metal elements: rough, rust-pocked with a matte finish.\n  - Bricks: uneven, with chipped surfaces and shadowed mortar seams.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- The main figure dominates the lower right quadrant, filling about half the canvas horizontally and three-quarters vertically, sitting against the ledge.\n- Arms and knees create diagonal lines from lower left (hands) to upper right (shoulder/head).\n- The ledge runs straight across the image about a third from the top, creating a horizontal division.\n- The vertical metal rod bisects the left side, with diagonal rods receding upward and backward from the plate, establishing depth.\n- The distant background is centered behind the ledge, contributing to a sense of space without distracting details.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photorealistic:** The image captures realistic lighting, textures, and anatomical detail.\n- **Color/lighting:** Warm, directional sunlight casts gentle highlights and deep shadows, creating strong contrast, especially on skin and concrete textures.\n- **Mood:** The composition is intimate and slightly somber, with a sense of solitude or reflection.\n- **Perspective:** Slightly above and in front of the figure, enhancing the feeling of enclosure.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n\n- **No visible text or explicit symbols** on clothing, wall, or background.\n- **Hardware details:** On the concrete ledge, a steel plate is affixed with six dark circular bolts; plate is rectangular and slightly offset left of the figure’s head.\n- **Metalwork:** The rods are of consistent width (about 1-2 inches), appearing old, with texture detail (rust bloom, subtle pitting).\n- **Seams on clothing:** Jeans have a prominent seam visible on the knee and thigh area, indicating classic jean design.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for SVG Recreation:**\n\n- Shape a seated human form with knees up, arms clasped around them; tank top and loose jeans.\n- Place this figure in the lower right foreground, body angled slightly toward the left.\n- Behind, extend a grainy-textured horizontal ledge topped with a rectangular, six-bolted plate near the left third.\n- Render metal rods: one vertical (left third), two diagonals receding.\n- Ground the composition with a textured brick wall under the ledge, and a soft blurred horizontal plane in the distance.\n- Use a palette of muted, natural tones; highlight gritty and worn textures.\n- No text, symbols, or prominent markings.\n\nLet me know if you need a geometric breakdown or SVG path suggestions!",

Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photographic Style:** High-contrast black-and-white, classic cinematic quality, likely from mid-20th century film or staged studio shot.\n- **Lighting:** Strong directional lighting from above and viewer’s left, producing defined highlights and shadows, especially on the jacket folds and hands.\n- **Outlines:** Crisp, with moderate shadow edges—jacket seams and hand outlines clearly defined against lighter surfaces.\n- **Texture:** Jacket and hands are rendered with soft gradation, background is smooth, door glass is misty, diffused.\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **Text:** On the frosted glass door, the word “WOMEN” clearly appears, all caps, sans-serif, horizontal, proportioned to the upper third of the door panel.\n- **Details:**\n  - Jacket lapels form an open triangle, collar points resting atop lapels.\n  - Tie is knotted in a traditional Windsor (triangular) shape, rail straight toward the bottom.\n  - Shirt cuffs barely visible at wrists.\n  - Hair is dark, parted at the side, slick.\n  - The chair/wainscot on the right consists of a horizontal wood bar (visible at the upper right third, extending rightward).\n\n---\n\n#### Geometric / Proportional Data & Layout for SVG:\n\n- **Central Figure:** Centered horizontally, shoulders span ~70% of canvas width, torso base 1/8 canvas height from bottom.\n- **Table:** Rectangle spanning entire bottom edge, height ~10% of canvas.\n- **Hands:** Largest hand area covers ~15% width, starting 20% from left edge, 10–25% from bottom.\n- **Door:** Rectangular, left edge flush, ~25% width, full height.\n- **Word “WOMEN”:** Horizontally centered on upper third of the frosted glass rectangle.\n- **Wall and Chair:** Background rectangle (wall) fills remainder, with a horizontal bar (chair) at bottom right, width ~25% of canvas, vertical height ~15% (from bottom right corner).\n\n---\n\nThis description provides the essential spatial data, key object detail, artistic style, and all elements necessary for an authentic SVG recreation.",
  "v1_172": "Certainly! Here is a comprehensive and precise image description for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- **Foreground Figure (Left/Center)**\n  - A man standing prominently in the foreground, dominating the left side of the frame. His body is angled slightly toward the camera, but he is looking to the right.\n  - His upper body fills approximately the left third of the image. His arms are raised, with both hands held together near chest height (possibly holding a small object).\n  - He wears a double-breasted suit jacket, with clearly visible lapels, a tie, and a crisp dress shirt. There is a rectangular pocket square poking out from his breast pocket.\n- **Foreground Figure (Right)**\n  - Another man stands to the right and slightly behind the first figure, facing forward. He occupies about the right quarter of the image.\n  - His clothes are darker and less formal; he wears a single-breasted jacket, a collared shirt, and a tie. A cloth badge or patch is pinned to the jacket.\n- **Midground Figure (Center-Right)**\n  - A woman stands further back, almost directly behind the main figure’s right shoulder.\n  - She is facing forward, holding a wrapped bundle or a blanket, arms folded across her front. She wears a coat with a large checkered/plaid pattern.\n- **Background Figures**\n  - The background is populated with several smaller, less distinct human figures, mainly grouped to the left and through the middle of the frame. They appear in shadow and detail is minimal.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- The image is entirely grayscale (black-and-white).\n- Contrast is moderate to high, with distinct outlines and clear separation of light/shadow (chiaroscuro effect typical of older cinema or photography).\n- Textures are realism-based: smooth, slightly shiny suit fabric and softer, matte outerwear.\n- Lighting is dramatic, with a strong source from the left and above, casting shadows and emphasizing the shapes of clothing and facial features.\n\n**3.

  "v1_182": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and structured description suitable for recreating this image as an SVG:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- **Central Figure (Standing on Shell):**\n  - A nude female figure occupies the central position, standing on a large scallop shell. She stands in a classical contrapposto pose with her legs close, left leg slightly bent, left hand covering her chest, right hand near her pelvis, partially covered by long flowing hair.\n  - Her long, wavy, golden-brown hair floats around, especially to her right (the viewer’s left).\n\n- **Left Group (Flying Figures):**\n  - To the left, two intertwined figures float above the water, just above the waves. The foremost figure is male, muscular, with light-blue wings, and wraps his arms around a female figure.\n  - Both are draped in flowing, light blue, wind-blown garments which create dynamic swirling shapes.\n  - Small pink flowers are scattered around them and blown through the air.\n\n- **Shell:**\n  - A large scallop shell, cream and tan, with detailed radiating grooves. It sits on the water near the shore, its open side facing upward, holding the central figure.\n\n- **Right Figure (Clothed Woman on Shore):**\n  - A cloaked woman to the right stands on land, slightly above the water’s edge.\n  - She wears a patterned white dress adorned with blue and red floral motifs and leaves, and a pale red, ornately decorated cloak that billows backward. Her right arm and leg reach forward, holding out a pinkish cloak, seemingly about to cover the central figure.\n  - Long, curly, reddish-brown hair flows behind her.\n  - She is partially backed by reeds, laurel, or myrtle trees.\n\n- **Background:**\n  - Horizontal bands of sea and sky occupy most of the background. The sea is rendered in gradations of turquoise, green, and blue, with visible wave patterns in the foreground.\n  - The horizon runs almost straight, positioned roughly in the upper third of the composition.\n  - The sky is pale blue, transitioning into softer, muted hues near the horizon.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Skin Tones:** Pale, peachy-cream, with soft shading and minimal harsh lines.\n- **Hair:** Golden, wavy and flowing (central figure); reddish brown and curly (right figure).\n- **Shell:** Light cream and beige tones, smooth shiny texture, with fine groove lines radiating outward.\n- **Drapery:** Light blue (left figures), white with blue and pinkish floral/foliage patterns and gold trim (right figure), and a rich red, patterned interior cloak (right figure).\n- **Water:** Variegated blue-greens, stylized white crescent shapes for waves, small pink flowers float atop.\n- **Sky:** Muted pale blue, faint cloudiness.\n- **Floral Elements:** Pink flowers (roses) with green leaves scattered prominently.\n- **Forested Area:** Dark green reeds and trees at the far right, contrasting with the pastel tones of the sky and water.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Left to Right Layout:** The flying figures are leftmost, central shell and nude figure in the exact center, clothed woman on the right. The land curves in from the lower right corner, supporting the position of the woman on shore.\n- **Depth:** Figures are fully frontal and occupy the foreground, with the sea receding into the background, establishing spatial volume.\n- **Proportions:** The central nude figure is about twice as tall as the shell below her. The clothed female on the right is slightly shorter, given her bent posture and positioning. The flying left figures are slightly smaller in scale, adding depth.\n- **Shell:** Its base sits at the bottom center, almost touching the canvas edge. The upper rim of the shell is at knee-level of the central figure.\n- **Horizon Line:** Located in the upper quarter of the image, just above the heads of left and right figures.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Technique:** Highly linear and detailed (contour lines are clear). The painting exhibits the refined, graceful forms, and flowing lines typical of Italian Renaissance art. Drapery and hair are stylized with intricate patterns and rhythmic lines.\n- **Color Palette:** Soft, harmonious, with pastel blues, pinks, creams, and earth tones.

  "v1_183": "Certainly! Here is a detailed SVG-oriented description of the image:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- **Seated Figure**: Dominating the right two-thirds of the composition is a person in side profile, sitting upright on a simple, straight-backed wooden chair. The figure’s head is slightly bowed forwards and hands rest calmly in their lap.\n- **Clothing**: The figure wears a voluminous, floor-length black dress with a high neckline, heavily silhouetted against the lighter gray background. There is a white lace collar around the neck and similar lace cuffs at the wrists.\n- **Headdress/Shawl**: A light, cream-colored headdress or shawl drapes over the figure’s hair and shoulders and forms a delicate contrast against the dark dress.\n- **Footrest**: The figure’s feet, clad in black footwear, rest on a small, low wooden rectangular footrest.\n- **Chair**: The chair's legs and seat are very minimally visible beneath the figure’s dress.\n- **Framed Artwork**: On the wall behind the figure, slightly above and in front of the head, is a horizontally-oriented rectangular picture frame containing a muted, brownish-gray landscape or cityscape.\n- **Curtain**: The left third of the image is filled by a dark, patterned curtain, hanging floor to ceiling, with a vertical edge that divides this section from the plain gray wall. The curtain features linear, wavy designs with clusters of pale yellow and white dots, giving the impression of stylized blossoms.\n- **Additional Details**: On the far right edge, a sliver of another vertical rectangle (suggestive of a framed artwork) is just barely seen.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Palette**: Dominated by muted grays, blacks, and off-whites. The curtain is charcoal gray with pale white and yellow dotted patterns. The wall is a flat, mid-tone gray. The picture frame is black with a white matte interior.\n- **Textures**: \n  - *Dress*: Soft and matte, heavily shadowed, especially under the seat and lower right.\n  - *Curtain*: Patterned, textured with wavy and dotted motifs.\n  - *Footrest*: Wooden, with visible grain.\n- **Contrast**: The black dress is the boldest large single shape, surrounded by lighter grays. White lace elements provide points of visual contrast.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Figure Placement**: The seated figure is positioned slightly right of center, occupying the lower right quadrant and up to about 60–70% of the image width.\n- **Wall and Curtain**: The vertical line where the curtain ends and the gray wall begins is roughly one quarter from the left edge.\n- **Artwork on Wall**: The framed picture is horizontally oriented, placed several inches above the figure’s head and a bit to the left (about where the back of the head is positioned). The bottom edge aligns just above where the back of the chair meets the wall.\n- **Footrest**: The footrest is centered below the figure’s knees and partially beneath the hem of the dress, on the floor, flush with the foreground plane.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Composition**: Very geometric, planar, and minimalistic, with large uninterrupted color fields (gray wall, black dress). The composition is highly orderly, with horizontal and vertical axes emphasized.\n- **Line and Form**: Crisp contours on the figure and furnishings; flowing, repetitive motifs in the curtain. Rectilinear geometric shapes dominate the rest (frames, footrest, wall).\n- **Lighting**: Flat and diffuse—minimal highlight or shadow, creating a calm, even atmosphere.\n- **Perspective**: Strict side view/profile with little depth, lending the scene an almost two-dimensional quality.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n- **Curtain Detail**: Near the upper left corner, a small, circular emblem or monogram is visible on the curtain, cueing subtle decorative detail.\n- **Framed Artwork**: The picture within the main frame is very muted—rectangles and blocks suggesting a pointillist or impressionist cityscape or riverscape, bordered by a simple black frame.\n- **Floor**: The floor is executed in olive and brown tones, with linear divisions suggesting wood planking or mats that recede in perspective toward the back right.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric/Proportional/Positional Information for SVG**\n- **Overall Layout**: Rectangle with vertical orientation (height about 1.25 times the width).\n- **Curtain**: Occupies leftmost 25-30% of width, with its edge a crisp vertical line.\n- **Main figure**: Sits with back approximately 65% from left, head at about 70% of height from bottom, facing left.\n- **Chair legs**: Front leg visible beneath the hem; rear leg barely visible against the floor.\n- **Picture Frame**: Rectangle, roughly 15% width by 10% height of canvas, centered horizontally over back two-thirds of the figure, with 5-10% margin from the top edge.\n- **Footrest**: Centered below knees, about 6-8% width.\n- **Decorative Circle on Curtain**: Near upper left, about 5% down and 10% from the left edge.\n\n---\n\nUse these details to construct precise SVG elements—rectangles (wall areas, picture frames, footrest), a semi-elliptical block for the figure, patterned fills for the curtain, and lace detailing near the hands and neckline.

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Dominant Central Mountain:**  \n  - A large, triangular/peak-shaped mountain dominates the left central area. It rises steeply from the lower edge toward the top center, with sweeping, curved contour lines indicating its slopes and ridges.\n  - The mountain surface is accentuated by vertical, slightly curved striations to show texture and elevation.\n  - Scatterings of small, rounded or pointed clusters indicate trees or shrubs clinging to the slopes.\n\n- **Secondary Masses:**  \n  - Lower-left: Smaller, rounded foreground rocks and hilly forms nestled at the mountain’s base.\n  - Mid-right: Cluster of smaller hills and plateaus, interspersed with dark, rounded tree canopies.\n  - Background: A receding vista of lighter, soft undulating mountains as a backdrop, sketched with minimal shading and fading into the upper horizon.\n\n- **Water Body:**  \n  - The mid-to-lower right section of the image is occupied by a wide river or lake, indicated by flat, almost unmarked space with occasional horizontal brush strokes for ripples and reflections.\n\n- **Vegetation and Architecture:**  \n  - The mountain and lower slopes are dotted with thin, vertical strokes for pine trees, their canopies depicted as dark, loose clusters of lines or brush dots.\n  - Near the summit of the central peak, a tiny pavilion or structure with a curved roof is perched precariously.\n  - Lower right foreground shows a denser forest, suggested by overlapping, rounded forms representing tree clusters with indistinct trunks.\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Colors:**  \n  - Monochromatic sepia or dark brown ink on a warm beige (aged paper) background.\n  - Ranges from light washes for distant mountains and water, to dark, opaque strokes for trees and architectural accents.\n\n- **Textures:**  \n  - The mountain has long, brushy vertical streaks for texture.\n  - Trees are represented with stippling or short, dense strokes.\n  - Water is left nearly clear except for a few smooth, horizontal lines.\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Composition:**  \n  - The central mountain occupies about 45% of the horizontal space, slightly left of center, and rises from the bottom edge almost to the image’s top.\n  - Foreground boulders extend a third of the way up on the left side.\n  - The water body begins about a third from the left and sweeps across to the right edge, narrowing as it recedes toward the horizon line (~1/3 down from the top).\n  - Mid-ground trees and hills are positioned to the right and slightly above the water for depth.\n  - Distant mountains fade into the background along the upper third.\n\n- **Proportions:**  \n  - The main peak has a height-to-width ratio about 3:2.\n  - Water body spans the lower half but is horizontally wide and visually thin.\n  - Trees range from very small dots (distance) to larger, stylized bushy forms in the closer areas.\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Technique:**  \n  - Traditional Chinese ink wash (shui-mo), emphasizing expressive brushwork and negative space.\n  - Minimalist use of color; emphasis on shaded gradient and ink density for depth.\n  - Elements are stylized and simplified rather than photorealistic.\n  - Outlines are soft or absent; forms are created through gradients and line direction.\n  - Foreground is detailed; background is blurred/faded.\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, and Details\n\n- **Text/Symbols:**  \n  - No overt text is visible in the image area described (top, bottom, and corners appear clear of inscriptions).\n- **Specific Details:**\n  - Pavilion on mountain top is very small, possible with only roof eaves and pillars indicated by a dozen short, fine lines.\n  - Trees are almost always clusters of dots or grouped lines, never detailed leaves.\n  - Rock faces marked by sharp, dark slashes imitating cracks and shadows.\n  - Water surface often “blank” or lightly marked to create contrast with the landforms.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary for SVG Reproduction**\n\n- Use layered polygons and curved Bezier paths for the mountain and hills, with varied thickness and opacity for brushstroke effect.\n- Overlay dark stippled patterns for trees on mountain slopes and clumped, rounded shapes for tree forests.\n- Draw a tiny, simplified pagoda at the peak, atop the mountain.\n- Render background mountains in low-opacity, soft-edged polygons.\n- Use minimal, semi-transparent horizontal lines for water.\n- Limit palette to gradients of sepia/brown.\n- Negative space is crucial, especially in the water and background sky.\n\n---\n\nIf you need explicit SVG instructions or further breakdown into coordinates and paths, let me know!",

The fruit is directly attached above the leaves.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photographic realism:** The image is a detailed, realistic photograph (not painterly or stylized).\n- **Depth of field:** Shallow—sharp focus on the main apple and the nearest rust-damaged leaves; background elements are soft and out of focus.\n- **Proportions:** The apple is about 1/3 the length of a full leaf beneath it, with the leaves extending roughly horizontally and diagonally across the frame.\n- **Edge treatment:** Leaves have crisply defined, serrated margins.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n\n- **No text or man-made symbols** present.\n- **Specific details:** \n    - **Diseased spots:** Irregular—some nearly round, others merging into larger blotches; rusty-orange, with darker borders occasionally visible.\n    - **Leaves:** Show secondary veins branching from the midrib at 30–45° angles, irregularly but clearly visible.\n    - **Fruit calyx:** The top of the apple (calyx end) is visible as a pale, small, star-shaped point where the stem meets the fruit.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric and Layout Information for SVG:**\n\n- **Central apple fruit:** Centered around the X:60%, Y:25% of the canvas, radius approx. 13% of canvas width/height.\n- **Main two foreground leaves:** Start near X:30-40%, Y:55-75%, curve outwards, each spanning about 40–50% canvas width, with lengths ~3x the apple’s diameter, broadest sections ~40% of their length from the base. Both have acute tips (~30–40° angle).\n- **Disease spots:** 6–12 per leaf, ellipses and blobs varying from 3–20% of the leaf’s surface area, clustered nearer the central and tip regions.\n- **Branch:** 8% width, entering at a ~40° angle from left to central upper canvas.\n- **Background fruit and leaves:** Circle for apple at X:80%, Y:20%, blurred/soft edges, 50% color intensity compared to foreground objects.\n\n---\n\nIf you need a more technical or numerically specified SVG layout, let me know!",
  "v1_189": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description of the image for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n**1. Main objects, shapes, and elements**\n- Central to the image is a single, large, broad leaf, most likely a lettuce or leafy green, oriented slightly diagonally from top left to bottom right.\n- The leaf features a pronounced central vein with several branching lateral veins, giving a distinct pinnate venation structure.\n- The central leaf is heavily damaged, with many irregularly shaped holes and tears, primarily concentrated toward the center and lower-left regions.\n- Surrounding the main leaf, but mostly out of focus, are additional similar green leaves, creating a background layer.\n\n**2. Colors, textures, and visual properties**\n- The leaf displays a range of green hues:\n  - Main healthy areas are medium to light green (#78AB46 to #A3C86B).\n  - Damaged areas along the veins appear yellowish or pale brown (#D6C87A to #BDAE6E) indicating dried or necrotic tissue.\n  - The holes are transparent, letting the shadowed and darker green of the background leaves show through.\n- Texture is slightly wrinkled with visible surface veination and minor glossy highlights, characteristic of natural leafy surfaces.\n- The damaged areas have a rougher, less glossy appearance.\n- The background leaves are darker, more muted green, and blurred or out of focus, enhancing the prominence of the central leaf.\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning**\n- The central leaf occupies about 60-70% of the image, centered slightly lower and to the right.\n- The leaf is oriented such that its stem emerges from the bottom center, with the tip of the leaf pointing toward the upper right corner.\n- Veins fan out from the base at regular intervals, dividing the leaf into five or six major sections.\n- The holes are concentrated along and between the veins, with the largest open spaces parallel to the central vein about one-third from the base.\n- Holes are mostly small (few millimeters wide), but some are larger, especially closer to the center and lower left quadrant.\n- Surrounding leaves are positioned behind and partially around the main leaf, providing a layered natural context.\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics**\n- The image is photorealistic, showing natural gradients, organic shapes, and irregularities.\n- No artificial outlines; color transitions are naturally blended with soft shadows and realistic highlights.\n- Holes and damaged areas have jagged and uneven edges, organic and random, not geometric.\n- The main leaf veins are broad, slightly raised, and lighter in color than surrounding tissue.\n\n**5. Text, symbols, or specific details**\n- There are no text, man-made symbols, or artificial markings.\n- Details to ensure SVG accuracy:\n  - The central vein starts at the bottom center and branches outward at roughly 30°–40° intervals.\n  - There are approximately 15-20 visible holes, varying from very small dots to more prominent oblong shapes (largest about one-tenth the leaf width).\n  - Holes cluster densely along the lower half, especially left of center.\n  - Damaged, discolored area at the lower left, faded with rough, uneven boundaries.\n\n**Geometric details and proportions:**\n- Main leaf: roughly heart-shaped, with a width:height ratio of about 1.2:1 (wider than tall).\n- Central vein: splits the leaf almost symmetrically; major lateral veins radiate in a slight upward curve.\n- Holes: Randomly distributed, with no clear pattern, but more densely packed near the base and central region.\n- The surrounding leaves (background) overlap about 5–10% of the main leaf at the edges, but are mostly out of focus and should be simplified in SVG as blurred or muted irregular shapes.\n\n**Summary for SVG recreation:**  \nThe SVG should feature a large, heart-shaped, green leaf with a branched central vein and realistic soft color gradients. Numerous organic, irregular holes of varying size (clustered near the base/center) should break up the leaf surface, with discolored, pale-yellow regions indicating necrosis. The background consists of similarly colored, but darker and blurred, overlapping leafy shapes. No text or symbols are present. The look is highly naturalistic, with emphasis on authenticity and the random, nonlinear distribution of damage.",
  "v1_190": "Certainly! Here is a detailed, SVG-relevant description of the image above:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The central focus is on several elongated, tear-shaped droplets of resin (tree sap) oozing down a rough bark surface.\n- There are three prominent, finger-like resin drips, roughly arranged in an inverted \"Y\" formation.\n    - The middle drip is longest and slightly bent, emerging from the center-top of the image and descending toward the bottom center.\n    - The two side drips branch outward and downward at a less steep angle.\n- The resin is semi-transparent with internal bubbles and some irregularities, but the overall forms are smooth and rounded.\n- In the background and to the sides/below the resin, the rough, uneven texture of tree bark is visible, with crevices, small protrusions, and embedded organic matter.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- **Resin:**\n    - Dominant color is golden amber (hex: #efa020 – #ffce73 gradient).\n    - High-gloss, glassy/shiny, with strong specular highlights, giving a wet/lustrous appearance.\n    - Inner bubbles or suspended particles add a speckled translucency.\n    - Edges of the resin are especially bright due to light refraction.\n- **Bark:**\n    - Very dark brown, almost black (hex: #181208 to #4d291b), with occasional touches of pale green moss or greyish lichen.\n    - Strong, rugged, craggy irregular texture (jagged polygons, variable heights, and indented crevices).\n    - Matte finish compared to resin.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- **Resin:**\n    - Largest drip (center) emerges from the upper third, about midpoint horizontally, curving down to touch the lower middle edge.\n    - The left drip starts from above the main drip and curves diagonally left and down.\n    - The right drip starts to the upper right, curving directly downward; it is slightly shorter and projects less toward the viewer.\n    - All resin drips project *outward* from the bark, appearing as raised or three-dimensional elements.\n- **Bark:**\n    - Fills the entire background, typically at about a 45-degree angle (upper left receding, lower right prominent).\n    - Resin sits atop a small mound or protrusion—giving the illusion that it’s welling up from a fissure.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- Hyper-realistic, photographic style.\n- Macro-level detail: the droplets and textures are highly magnified, emphasizing surface details and transparency.\n- Focus is sharply on the resin and immediate bark, as the background quickly blurs (shallow depth of field typical in macro photography).\n- No stylization, abstraction, or artistic exaggeration; the forms are organic and natural.\n- Lighting is soft but directional, coming from the upper right, causing pronounced highlights and shadows.\n\n**5. Any Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- No text, numbers, or recognizable symbols appear.\n- **Details for SVG:**\n    - All resin droplets are smoothly contoured (use Bezier paths for the rounded, viscous look).\n    - Internal \"bubbles\" can be modeled as lighter ellipses/circles within the droplets with low opacity.\n    - Bark texture should be indicated with irregular polygonal paths and overlayed spot shapes to mimic crags/depth.\n    - Use gradients and layered transparencies for both resin (highlight/shadow) and bark (depth/crevices).\n    - Edges where resin meets bark are irregular; resin often has tiny protrusions, suggesting viscosity.\n    - No sharp artificial boundaries; all transitions are organic and uneven.\n    - Primary relationships: resin protrudes and overlaps the bark, casting subtle shadows onto it.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Sketch Layout (for SVG):**\n- **Artboard:** Square, resin occupies central to upper third; bark fills background.\n- **Primary shapes:** Three main resin drips; central is dominant, left/right shorter and thinner, all overlap bark texture.\n- **Coloring:** Amber gradients with white/yellow shine for resin; dark, textured bark with scattered lighter spots.\n- **Detail:** Model “glassiness” with highlights on the resin's surface; add small circles/ovals for internal bubbles.\n\nIf you would like a schematic breakdown or direct pseudo-SVG for any elements, let me know!",

Several smaller, stubby offshoots or twigs branch off; one branch crosses behind the fruit.\n- **No leaves present**, only bare branches and twigs.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Fruit:**\n  - Dominant Color: Deep reddish-brown, indicative of rot and dehydration, with dark maroon and almost blackish accents, especially in shadowed ridges.\n  - Texture: Heavily wrinkled and pitted surface, uneven, almost crusty, with areas dusted with beige/grayish fungal powder (toward the upper right and side).\n  - Highlights/Shadow: Lighter tan or grayish crust where fungus is present; shadowed lower left is much darker.\n- **Branches:**\n  - Color: Dull brownish-gray with subtle gradients, hints of olive or greenish tinges from lichen or moss patches in a few spots (notably at some branch junctions).\n  - Texture: Smooth with occasional small bumps and lenticels, realistically rendered.\n  - Lichen: Small, roundish dabs of pale yellow-green (lichen colonies) at two or three points, most visible near a large knob on the limb in the mid-right of the picture.\n- **Background:**\n  - Out-of-focus, gradient sky, mostly pale blue and very light warm beige/off-white, with soft transition, suggesting shallow depth of field.\n  - No features or secondary objects in the background—entirely blurred for emphasis on the foreground.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Main Branch:** Enters from near the bottom left corner, curves upward, and exits at the upper right; thick enough to be an old limb.\n- **Fruit Attachment:** The fruit hangs freely from a short, slender stem that projects perpendicularly from the upper surface of the main branch, roughly at a 40-degree angle (upper left to lower right).\n- **Fruit Position:** Slightly to the left of the center of the image; fruit is the compositional focus.\n- **Other Branches:** Smaller sub-branches or twigs are present in the foreground (directly holding the fruit) and background (out-of-focus, upper left and right), crossing diagonally but staying thin, some blurred.\n- **Negative Space:** Sky and blurred background dominate the upper left and upper right quadrants.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photo-realistic rendering:** If recreating as SVG, keep texturing either through detailed pattern fills or stippling for fungal areas; use soft gradients for shadows and highlights on fruit and branches.\n- **No outlines on objects:** The photograph lacks cartoon outlining; shading and shape are defined through gradients and texture rather than stroke.\n- **Shallow depth of field:** Background is extremely blurred (bokeh), emphasizing main objects.\n- **Color Palette:** Primarily muted earth tones with a pop of lichen yellow, and a cold, pale blue sky for contrast.\n- **No symmetry; composition is organic and off-center.**\n\n---\n\n### 5.

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n\n- **Three Strawberries (centerpiece, foreground):**\n  1. **Top-Left Strawberry (Healthy):** Plump, heart-shaped, slightly rounded triangle with a smooth curve on both sides. Approximately 1.5 times wider than the smaller berry below.\n  2. **Bottom-Center Strawberry (Healthy):** Smaller and more conical, similar in shape but less plump than the top one.\n  3. **Top-Right Strawberry (Rotten):** Almost same size as the top-left but shriveled, with an uneven, withered surface. Distinctly overlaid by thick, dusty gray mold with small dark brown specks, covering most of its surface. The calyx above this berry is dry, brown, and curled upward.\n\n- **One Unripe Strawberry (Middle):**\n  - Very small, oval to peanut-shaped, pale green with visible, slightly raised seeds. Protrudes from between the larger berries, slightly right and downward from the main red berry.\n\n- **Leaves:**\n  - Large, green, serrated strawberry leaves cluster at the top and edges. Veins are detailed and prominent, with a slightly waxy, shiny texture.\n\n- **Stems:**\n  - Thin, greenish-yellow stems extend from above the berries, connecting to each fruit and leaf. The stem of the rotten berry appears slightly more withered and brownish.\n\n- **Background:**\n  - Wooden, weathered brown board/plank with visible horizontal lines/grains, faded and slightly textured.\n  - Lower left corner: More strawberry leaves, bright green with serrated edges, angled toward the foreground.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n\n- **Healthy Strawberries:** \n  - Bright, saturated red, glossy surface with small yellowish-white seeds scattered regularly across. Seeds are slightly recessed or protruding.\n  - Subtle dimpling around the seeds adds texture.\n  - The smaller healthy berry is red but slightly less saturated, possibly still ripening.\n\n- **Unripe Strawberry:** \n  - Pale to light green with a matte, bumpy surface dotted by pale yellow-green seeds.\n\n- **Rotten Strawberry:** \n  - Surface coated in fine, powdery, bluish-gray mold (Botrytis), obscuring the original red beneath.\n  - Mold is denser at the tip, less dense (fading) as it approaches the base under the calyx. The calyx is dried, light brown and curled upward.\n\n- **Leaves:** \n  - Deep green, shiny, with white to light green veins.\n  - Serrated edges; the surface shows shallow wrinkles or undulating contours typical to strawberry leaves.\n\n- **Background (Wood):**\n  - Light to medium brown, grainy, and rough texture with horizontal striations and occasional knots/imperfections in the wood.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- **Main Grouping of Strawberries:**\n  - The three main berries (two healthy, one rotten) are clustered centrally, hanging downwards with their tops nearly touching.\n  - The largest, healthy strawberry (top left) sits higher than the other two.\n  - The rotten berry (top right) slightly overlaps the smaller healthy berry (bottom center), both just below the largest one.\n  - Unripe berry (middle) protrudes diagonally to the right from beneath the largest healthy strawberry, almost touching the rotten berry.\n\n- **Stems:** \n  - Flow downward and outward, converging towards the berry tops. The stems and their angles create a gentle Y-like fork.\n\n- **Leaves:** \n  - Clustered above and to the left/right edges, framing the berries. One smaller, sharply serrated leaf points diagonally from the lower left outside the main berry cluster.\n\n- **Background:** \n  - The wooden plank forms the entire background, extending uninterrupted behind the plant elements.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- **Photographic Realism:**\n  - Shine, surface imperfections, and accurate colors with high detail in texture.\n  - Fine details visible: individual seeds, mold fuzz, subtle water droplets, veins in leaves.\n- **Natural Lighting:** \n  - No harsh shadows, lighting is soft but directional, coming from above/front. Berries have natural highlights and subtle reflected light.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, Specific Details:**\n\n- **No text or letterforms present in the image.**\n- **No overt symbols.**\n- Details of note:\n  - The rotten strawberry shows clear, fuzzy mold texture, contrast with the smooth, shiny healthy fruit.\n  - Seed distribution is very even over healthy berries, but more difficult to distinguish on the molded one.\n  - Calyxes (leafy caps at the top of strawberries) are green on healthy fruit, dried and brown on the rotten one.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, Layout (for SVG design):**\n\n- **Aspect Ratio:** Nearly square (assume 1:1).\n- **Berry Sizes (relative to canvas):**\n  - Largest berry: ~22% of canvas height, centered horizontally ~30% from left edge.\n  - Rotten berry: Slightly smaller, offset diagonally ~10° right-down from largest, top aligned.\n  - Small healthy berry: ~60% the size of largest, directly below rotten berry.\n  - Unripe berry: ~30% the size of large berry, placed between (overlapping) the two larger ones.\n- **Berry Arrangement:** \n  - Vertically stacked but offset horizontally, forming roughly a lowercase “y” shape group.\n- **Leaf Sizes:** \n  - Major leaves: 1.5× as wide/tall as largest berry, attached above and framing fruit; minor leaves ~30% the size, positioned lower left.\n- **Wood Plank:** \n  - Runs completely behind all objects, with visible grain; color bands are horizontal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Schema for SVG:**\n\n- 3x strawberry (2 red, 1 gray/moldy, 1 green unripe, from left/top to right/bottom)\n- Green/yellow-brown stems connect to berries, meet off-canvas top.\n- Leaf clumps (3–4 large, serrated, veined, overlapping upper boundary)\n- Wooden background with grain and weathering marks\n\n---\n\nIf you require a schematic diagram or geometric coordinate suggestions for actual SVG path drawing, please specify further, and I can break down into path primitives and anchor points.",
  "v1_197": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description of the image above, suitable for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- **Central Object:** A single, large, broad leaf occupies nearly the entire image, with the midrib running diagonally from the bottom left toward the upper right.\n- **Leaf Shape:** The visible section of the leaf is an irregular elongated oval, widest toward the left-middle and tapering slightly toward the top-right and bottom-left corners.\n- **Spots/Lesions:** Scattered across the leaf are approximately 10 irregularly shaped brown spots (lesions). These are polygonal to roughly circular in outline, each with wavy, uneven edges.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Leaf Color:** Predominantly green, but showing a yellowish tinge (chlorosis) across much of its surface, especially around the brown lesions.\n- **Lesion Color:** The spots are medium to dark brown in color, with lighter tan to grayish centers, and have a rough, wrinkled texture suggestive of dead tissue.\n- **Textural Details:** The rest of the leaf shows a slightly rough, almost granular or pebbled texture, with visible raised veins.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Veins:** The main midrib runs diagonally and branches out with visible secondary veins at shallow angles, giving a “netted” appearance.\n- **Lesions Placement:**\n  - Most lesions are near the center or aligned around the midrib, but some extend toward the leaf edges.\n  - The largest lesions (approx. 2-3 cm at their largest dimension in real terms) are located below the midvein, toward the bottom left quadrant.\n  - Other smaller lesions are distributed roughly evenly, with no lesion in the extreme right or left edges.\n- **Lesion Size:** Lesions vary from approximately 5mm to 20mm (in real dimensions); scaled proportionally for the SVG.\n- **Background:** Out-of-focus dark green leaves and brown soil are barely visible in the background, providing context but not detail.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Photo-realistic:** The image is a close-up photograph, so the SVG should aim to mimic natural irregularities and organic, non-symmetrical forms.\n- **Line work:** Veins are not perfectly straight but gently curve and branch off irregularly, creating polygonal patches across the leaf.\n- **Lesion Borders:** Each brown spot has a distinct, somewhat jagged and uneven border, perhaps outlined with a slightly darker edge.\n- **Texture suggestion:** Use subtle gradients and possibly a ‘wrinkled’ fill effect within lesions to mimic the rough, sunken look.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **No Text or Symbols:** The image contains no added text, symbols, or artificial markings.\n- **Proportion/LAYOUT:**\n  - Leaf covers ~90% of the image area.\n  - The largest lesion is about 1/10th of the leaf’s total visible area.\n  - Secondary veins create 5-7 major “sections” in the leaf between the midrib and the edge.\n- **Subtle Details:**\n  - Very fine white or pale stippling (possibly trichomes/hairs or droplets) is present on the leaf surface, best mimicked as a sparse, subtle texture.\n  - Lesions are sometimes ringed by a faint yellow halo, likely representing further tissue damage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for SVG Recreation:**\n- Draw a large irregular oval/elliptical leaf occupying most of the canvas.\n- Add a thick, gently curved midrib diagonally from bottom left to top right.\n- Branch thinner, gently curved veins from the midrib to the leaf margin.\n- Fill the leaf with a gradient of green to yellow-green, with yellow concentrations around the lesions.\n- Draw 8-10 irregular polygons for lesions, mostly near the midrib, with brown and tan gradient fills and slightly wavy, dark outlines.\n- Add subtle granular/stippled texture to the entire leaf; within lesions, use wrinkled textures.\n- Background: Out-of-focus green and brown shapes to imply plants/soil, low-detail.\n- No text, icons, or man-made features.\n\nThis detail should be sufficient for a precise SVG recreation of the image.

  "v1_198": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise SVG-oriented description of the image, focusing on the visible elements:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The central subject is a bust portrait of a person depicted from the chest upwards, wearing elaborate, voluminous curly hair typical of the 17th-18th century (often called a periwig or full-bottomed wig).\n- The clothing consists of a high-collared, white shirt or cravat, layered beneath a dark, somewhat loose outer garment.\n- The background is plain with fine cross-hatched lines radiating outward from the figure, giving a soft vignette effect.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- The image is grayscale (black, white, and various shades of grey).\n- The hair texture is rendered with detailed, swirling lines to create many defined ringlets and curls, conveying both depth and softness.\n- The clothing displays subtle, controlled crosshatching and stippling for shading, giving the cloth a velvet or woolen appearance.\n- The background texture fades smoothly from the figure outward with lighter crosshatched lines, producing a gradual transition to the white of the page.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The figure is closely centered in the composition.\n- The voluminous hair occupies nearly the top two-thirds of the vertical space and extends almost the full width.\n    - The hair starts in a central part at the top of the head, then cascades in large, even curls outward and downward to the shoulders and chest.\n    - On both left and right sides, the curls reach just past the shoulders, covering the upper arms—especially prominent on the right (viewer’s left) side where the hair overlaps the cloak.\n- The shirt/cravat meets at the sternum in a vertical, slightly opened V-shape, with small folds and a central button or decorative fastening.\n- The cloak/robe begins below the cravat, forming loose drapes at mid-torso and extending down out of the frame.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The entire portrait is executed in classic engraved style, reminiscent of 18th or early 19th-century copperplate engravings.\n- Individual lines, especially in the hair and clothing, are fine and crisply rendered, with visible linework for shadows.\n- The portrait’s proportions are naturalistic and slightly elongated, with the hair exaggerated for stylistic effect.\n- There is no visible background scene, only soft, radiating hatching.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- There is no visible text, signature, or emblem within the visible crop of the image.\n- Details include:\n    - Each curl in the wig is drawn as a spiral or loose loop, overlapping neatly with neighboring curls.\n    - The outer garment has gentle folds and subtle creases, indicated by changes in line density and direction.\n    - The vignette effect is purely linear, fading radially outward.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric Details and Proportions for SVG:**\n- Figure occupies center 75% width, 90% height.\n- Wig: Plan for multiple overlapping elliptical spirals (approx. 2–3 per row, 3–4 rows per side).\n- Shoulders: Curve downward from just below bottom curl clusters.\n- Shirt/cravat: Central vertical shape (slightly bulbous triangle), with a narrow opening/horizontal crease, and faint fold lines.\n- Outer garment: Two broad, curved planes starting beneath wig’s lowest curls on each side, meeting at lower center.\n- Background: Radial, densely spaced lines behind the upper portion of the figure, thinning outward.\n\n---\n\nThis description should allow for a high fidelity SVG recreation of the scene, maintaining the original’s period style, texture, and balanced layout.",
  "v1_199": "Certainly! Here’s a precise and comprehensive description suitable for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Central Figure**: The image centers on a standing statue in traditional robes. The figure is depicted from the mid-torso up, occupying roughly 80% of the frame's vertical axis and nearly the full width horizontally.\n- **Hands & Gesture**: The figure’s hands are foregrounded at the chest, forming a crossed gesture—right hand clenched and supported by the left hand below.\n- **Attire**: The figure wears a robe with wide, rounded sleeves and a thick collar. The collar is detailed with an ornate, repeating pattern. The outer robe has a visible lapel on the right.\n- **Accessories**: A rectangular object resembling a ceremonial jade tablet or symbol rests vertically across the left shoulder, attached with binding lines carved into its surface.\n- **Headgear**: At the very top is a rounded, low-profile hat encircling the upper head.\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Color Palette**: The statue is a uniform dull gray-green patina, typical of aged bronze, with slight reflective highlights on protruding surfaces. The background contrasts with a terracotta reddish roof featuring rows of vertical tiles and occasional green mossy patches.\n- **Texture**: The statue’s surface is weathered, showing smoothness on broad areas and subtle pitting or roughness where details occur (like folds, patterns, and fingers). The roof in the background displays a repetitive ridged texture due to the tiles.\n- **Materiality**: The statue’s metallic quality is revealed by soft highlights and gentle shadow transitions.\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Statue Position**: Centered both horizontally and vertically. The top of the head is near the top edge, and elbows/midriffs are cropped at the bottom.\n- **Hand Placement**: The crossed hands are placed approximately halfway down the visible torso, at chest height. Hands are oriented diagonally, angled left (viewer’s perspective), overlapping in front of the body’s centerline.\n- **Accessory Position**: The rectangular motif on the left shoulder is vertically aligned, parallel to the statue’s length, partially protruding upward.\n- **Background Relationship**: Background is out of focus, providing layered depth. The parallel roof tiles run diagonally up from left to right, creating a visual band, while darker sections/wooden eaves provide contrast below.\n- **Proportions**: Figure head to visible torso is approximately a 1:1.5 ratio. Arms and sleeves are wide—suggesting a generous robe fit.\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Realism**: The statue is realistic, with attention to anatomical accuracy (fingers, hand gesture, robe folds) but also stylized through the exaggerated width of the sleeves and the sharp angularity of collar details.\n- **Symmetry**: The statue maintains near-perfect bilateral symmetry: both shoulders equally broad, collar uniformly patterned, hands equally proportioned and tightly clasped.\n- **Embellishment**: Collar/lapel area displays repeated, shallow-relief rectangular or circular motifs.\n- **Cultural Style**: The clothing and objects are indicative of traditional East Asian scholarship or officialdom, with iconography appropriate for a Confucius or similar sage statue.\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **Patterned Trim**: The robe’s collar is adorned with a repeating, interlocked motif, possibly stylized clouds or geometric scrollwork, running the full length of the collar’s edge.\n- **Jade Tablet Detail**: The vertical accessory on the left shoulder is rectangular, bounded by straight lines, and features closely spaced horizontal incised stripes or crosshatching.\n- **Finger Detailing**: Fingers are defined by sculpted joints and lines, realistic in proportion, positioned in a precise gesture (right hand clenched, left hand cupping from beneath).\n- **No visible inscribed text** on the statue’s surface in the cropped area.\n- **Roof Detail**: The background consists of alternating ridges and furrows (arranged diagonally), possibly capped with ceramic or painted tile endings.\n\n---\n\n**SVG Reproduction Notes:**\n- Use a central vertical axis for the statue.\n- Robe base should be a broad \"U\" with ample width, sleeves flared and draping toward the bottom corners.\n- Hands should overlap in an ‘X’ orientation at mid-chest.\n- Collar: trace two parallel curved lines framing the neck, fill with repeating motifs.\n- Accessory: a tall rectangle with crosshatching, slightly angled, attached to the left shoulder.\n- Background: wide rectangle, fill with repeated short vertical lines for roof tiles, over darker bands for shadowed eaves.\n- Proportions: Head (height):torso (exposed height):overall width ≈ 1:1.5:1.25. Arms project just beyond the torso's outer width.\n\nLet me know if you need explicit geometric values or path coordinates for SVG coding!",

Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n\n- The figure takes up the central 75% of the image, with head and shoulders almost reaching the top, and the arms extending to the lower third.\n- The outer cloak drapes symmetrically over both shoulders, with angular, architectonic folds suggesting a voluminous cut.\n- The shirt is framed by a wide, square neckline and is visible beneath the open cloak.\n- The visible hand on the chest is slightly right of center, fingers delicately bent, thumb to the left and pinky to the right; the forearm and wrist slope diagonally downward, terminating near the opposite hand.\n- The canvas background is a uniform, cool gray-brown, subtly textured, with faint color gradation.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n\n- The style is highly realistic, with meticulous attention to chiaroscuro (contrast of light and shadow).\n- Drapery and flesh are rendered with smooth, blended brushstrokes.\n- Lighting is soft and diffused, falling from the left, creating gentle shadows across the figure and clothing folds.\n- Pearl-like bracelet or chain visible at the wrist of the hand on the chest, suggesting wealth or status.\n- Garment edges and folds are clear, geometric, and structural, typical of Renaissance portraiture.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n\n- Inscribed gold Latin lettering spans the very top edge horizontally, pressed against the upper border of the image, extending nearly full width.\n- Lettering is uppercase, serifed, and of small to moderate size, aligned horizontally.\n- A small, secondary inscription is visible at the upper-right quadrant, smaller and fainter than the top inscription, also in gold or ochre color.\n- No symbols or coat-of-arms are visible on the clothing.\n- No background objects; the setting is nondescript.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric/Proportional Information:**\n\n- The torso forms a tall rectangle, approximately 1.6 times taller than it is wide.\n- Shoulders span about 2/3 the width of the canvas; elbow-to-elbow length is about 3/4 the width.\n- The hand on the chest’s longest finger spans about 1/4 the width of the torso; the hand’s position is about 1/3 down from the top.\n- The hat’s brim projects outward, width roughly equal to head-height, with an angled peak.\n- All items are centered; the head and torso are symmetrically aligned.\n\n---\n\nThis should provide all the information necessary for an accurate SVG recreation, including layout, shapes, color, and key details.",
  "v1_202": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description of the image for SVG recreation purposes:\n\n**1. Main objects, shapes, and elements:**\n- The central figure is an upper torso and head of a person, with the face area intentionally obscured by a large, symmetric rectangle.\n- The most prominent feature is an expansive, frizzy mass of hair radiating outward from the head in all directions, occupying roughly the top third of the image.\n- The person is wearing a textured coat with a prominent collar and dark buttons aligned vertically at the center front.\n- There are blurry, rounded foreground shapes in the bottom left and bottom right corners which appear to be out-of-focus portions of other people.\n- The background consists of an uneven scatter of leafy, natural elements, suggesting an outdoor setting with bokeh or shallow depth of field.\n\n**2. Colors, textures, and visual properties:**\n- The image is in grayscale (black and white) with a full range of midtones, highlights, and shadows.\n- The hair is a very bright, almost white tone with soft, wispy, and chaotic texture.\n- The coat has a medium to light gray tone with noticeable visual grain or pattern (suggesting a woolen or textured textile).\n- The collar of the coat is distinct with strong shadow lines suggesting thickness and depth.\n- The background foliage is rendered in blurry, mottled gray tones.\n- The obscuring rectangle covering the central area is a uniform medium-gray with mild gradient/blur.\n\n**3. Spatial relationships and positioning:**\n- The figure dominates the image and is centered horizontally, occupying most of the vertical span from just beneath the top to just beneath center.\n- Hair extends outward in all directions, forming an irregular but generally circular or oval silhouette, with the widest point being at ear/cheek height.\n- The obscuring rectangle is vertically aligned with the head and placed exactly over where facial features would be, roughly square in format and extending from hairline to chin.\n- The coat's collar forms strong upward-angled lines from the center front, breaking at the point where the button area meets collar.\n- The blurry foreground objects enter from the lower corners and are out of focus, soft-edged, and rounded.\n\n**4. Style and artistic characteristics:**\n- The image is in a documentary or candid black-and-white photographic style.\n- Natural outdoor lighting is suggested by the soft shadows and varying highlights on the hair and coat.\n- The background blur and depth-of-field are photographic, not artificial.\n- Grain and subtle blur are consistent with mid-20th-century photographic film.\n\n**5. Any text, symbols, or specific details:**\n- There is no visible text or symbolic imagery present in the photo.\n- Details of the coat: two visible dark round buttons (one at the base of the collar, one below), with the possibility of a third button further down (not clearly visible due to angle/crop).\n- The coat’s collar is large, roughly semicircular on each side, and sits symmetrically on the shoulders, with a gentle fold/crease pattern radiating from the buttons.\n- The proportions: the head-with-hair area occupies approximately the central two-thirds horizontally and one-third vertically from the top. The obscuring rectangle is centered, covering ~60% of the hair's width and extending vertically from ~5% below the top of the head (hair) to just under the base of the chin (allowing both collar points and buttons to remain visible).\n\n**Geometric and layout details for SVG:**\n- Canvas: Landscape rectangle.\n- Large concentric, irregular ellipse/circle for the hair, filled with feathery linear strokes.\n- Central upright rounded-shoulder trapezoid (coat/body), with two semicircular collar shapes extending from the neckline.\n- Two small filled circles aligned vertically down front center (for buttons).\n- Large, centered rectangle with slight gradient blur effect (for the obscured face), perfectly vertical orientation.\n- Background: random array of soft, blurry, organic ellipses/circles for leaves, with some darker splashes to the right and left side at upper levels.\n- Foreground occlusions: two large, softly faded ovals at the bottom corners, fading out to background across their upper edge.\n\n**Proportions and layout (approximate, for SVG):**\n- Hair: 80% width, 40% height of canvas, starting 5% from top.\n- Obscuring rectangle: 35% width, 45% height of canvas, centered on x and starting at 20% from top.\n- Head (beneath hair): ~20% width, 25% height of canvas, centered.\n- Coat: bottom 40% of canvas, width ~50%, centered.\n- Buttons: 1-2% diameter, centered vertically at 55% and 60% from top.\n\nThis should allow a faithful SVG recreation focusing on geometric features, layout, and textural cues present in the original photograph.",

  "v1_214": "Certainly! Here is a precise, detailed description of the image, structured as requested for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- The image contains **four 3D pie charts** in two rows (two charts per row).\n- **Each row** represents the electricity production by fuel source in a specific country: the first row is Australia, the second is France.\n- **Columns** represent time: the left charts show data for 1980, the right for 2000.\n- Each pie chart has multiple colored sectors, each labeled with value numbers.\n- Charts have **shadows** underneath for a 3D effect.\n- Each row is topped by a teal-colored title describing the charts in that row.\n- Under each chart are two lines of text: the year (large) and “Total Production: XXX units” (smaller).\n- A **legend** (vertical, right of each 2000 chart in France & Australia) is present only on the bottom row. The legend has colored boxes next to text labels for each source: \"Natural Gas\" (blue), \"Oil\" (yellow), \"Coal\" (black or dark brown), \"Nuclear Power\" (brown), \"Hydro Power\" (red).\n- The background is white with a subtle diagonal line texture filling the chart areas.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n### Pie Segment Colors:\n- **Natural Gas:** Dark blue\n- **Oil:** Yellow\n- **Coal:** Green\n- **Nuclear Power:** Brown\n- **Hydro Power:** Red\n\n### 3D Effects:\n- All charts have a slight vertical thickness (dark shadow below).\n- Sectors look extruded to give 3D “sliced” appearance, especially more pronounced for the “Hydro Power” and “Oil” slices in the 2000 charts (they are pulled out).\n\n### Chart & Background:\n- The pie charts are on a light gray background inside their frames.\n- Frame borders are subtle; grid-style 2x2.\n- Heading and year/text labels are in teal or black sans-serif fonts.\n- All text is sharp and modern; unit numbers are white on their respective segments for visibility.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Full Layout:** 2x2 grid, evenly spaced horizontally and vertically, centralized.\n    - Top label: \"Units of electricity by fuel source in Australia\" - centered above the top row\n    - Bottom label: \"Units of electricity by fuel source in France\" - centered above the bottom row\n\n- **Within Each Chart:**\n    - Each pie chart is a circle, occupying most of the cell it’s in.\n    - Below each pie chart: \"1980\"/\"2000\" (centered), and under it, \"Total Production: xxx units\" (smaller font).\n\n- **Legend (bottom row, France charts):**\n    - Positioned outside charts, to the right in the case of France 2000, lists each fuel source with its color, vertically aligned, colored square at left of each label.\n\n- **Data Labels:**\n    - Each slice has a value label (number), centrally placed on the slice.\n    - In the 2000 charts, the smallest slices (2 units) for Oil and Natural Gas are separated (“exploded” out) with values outside connected by thin black leaders.\n    - Australia, 1980: all numbers inside pie.\n    - Australia, 2000: yellow (Oil) 2 and blue (Natural Gas) 2 slices are exploded.\n    - France, 1980: all numbers inside pie.\n    - France, 2000: yellow (Oil) 2 and blue (Natural Gas) 2 slices are exploded.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

  "v1_215": "Certainly! Here’s a detailed and comprehensive description of the image for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Road system**: The most prominent feature is a set of thick, curved black lines representing *main roads*. On the right-central side is a large roundabout/junction from which four roads radiate outward, each curving in different directions:\n    - One extends upwards/north (slightly curved left).\n    - One extends right/east (slightly downward).\n    - One extends south (straighter).\n    - One extends left/west (curves to upper left).\n- **Railway line**: A thick, black-and-white dashed line runs horizontally from the left-middle edge to the right-middle edge, just below the roundabout, passing *through* the main road and roundabout structure. Near the left, the railway runs close and parallel to the main 'left' road, diverging after the station.\n- **Motorway**: A thinner, black-and-white double line, running diagonally from bottom left to right, slightly above the railway—crosses the road system.\n- **Development regions**: There are multiple irregular closed polygons (areas), each distinctly patterned (with different hatching/dots), marking the development during various periods:\n    - Top-left: Large area, densely dotted\n    - Bottom-left: Two adjacent regions—one densely dotted (mirrors the top-left pattern) and another with diagonal (bottom-left to top-right) parallel lines, wider spacing.\n    - Center: Small region left of the station, light gray, no pattern.\n    - Center-right: One small horizontally hatched region above the railway, one much larger hatched region below the railway\n    - Top-right: Two separate regions, both with the diagonal-line pattern\n    - Right-central: Another irregular hatched region\n- **Chorleywood Station**: Small solid black rectangle/rectangular area at the intersection of the railway and the main road near the left center; labeled “Chorleywood Station” below it.\n- **Golf Course**: The text “Chorleywood Park and Golf course” is centered in the map above the railway, with no border or distinct region.\n- **Map legend**: A key at the bottom gives meaning to line styles and area patterns (hatchings, dots) with corresponding years.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Primary color**: All lines, text, and patterns are in grayscale (black, white, and shades of gray).\n- **Main roads**: Thick solid black lines.\n- **Railway**: Thick white (or empty) center band, bordered by solid black, broken by regular black horizontal bars (dashed).\n- **Motorway**: Double parallel black lines with narrow white/empty space between them.\n- **Development regions**:\n    - **1868–1883**: Pale/white fill, thin border, no pattern.\n    - **1883–1922**: Horizontal parallel lines, moderate spacing.\n    - **1922–1970**: Dotted pattern (fairly dense).\n    - **1970–1994**: Diagonal parallel lines (bottom-left to top-right), wider spacing.\n- **Chorleywood Station**: Solid black filled rectangle.\n- **Legend**: Small line/area samples with text labels.\n- **Labels**: All in simple black sans-serif font.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **Framing**: The entire diagram is centered within a thin black rectangle margin.\n- **Roundabout** (junction):\n    - Just right of center.\n    - Four roads radiate from it—top, right, bottom, left.\n    - The railway crosses immediately below the roundabout, with a slight curve.\n- **Chorleywood Station**: \n    - Slightly left of center, just above its own label (to the right of the main left-hand road, above the railway).\n- **Development areas**:\n    - Top-left (dotted region) is largest, extends diagonally from the railway/road intersection to the top left edge.\n    - Bottom-left (dotted and diagonally hatched regions) span from the railway down to the left/bottom margin.\n    - Center area (1868–1883, empty) is the smallest, leftward of the station.\n    - Center-right (horizontally hatched above, diagonally hatched below the railway) fill the right of the map.\n    - Top-right areas are above/right of the roundabout.\n- **Roads**: Intersect mostly at the large roundabout, except for the main left-hand road, which curves to meet the railway near the station.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Technical/Informational style** — clear outlines, pattern fills for areas (no color), geometric but hand-drawn appearance (slight irregularities in borders), strong emphasis on legibility.\n- **Patterns**: Simple repeating patterns (dots, parallel lines at regular angles).\n- **Sans-serif typeface** for labels.\n- **Legend/Key**: Simple lines and patterned rectangles with labels.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

  "v1_28": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description suitable for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The central focus is a tightly packed group of motocross racers on off-road motorcycles, poised at the start of a race.\n- There are twelve visible racers, each on a dirt bike, forming a staggered horizontal arc across the lower-middle half of the image.\n- Background elements include a large billboard/sign, grassy patches, a segment of a yellow safety barrier, and churned-up dirt — denoting a race track.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- Bikers’ uniforms are highly vibrant, featuring bold solids and graphic patterns in red, yellow, green, black, blue, and white, along with sponsor logos and number plates on the chest and front fender.\n- Motorcycles match or complement the rider uniforms, with color-coordinated body panels and numbers: green (Kawasaki), red (Honda), orange (KTM), blue (Yamaha), yellow (Suzuki), and black/white variants.\n- The dirt on the ground shows heavy texture, in earthy browns, scattered with shadows and chunks kicked up by tires, creating a sense of motion.\n- The billboard background is primarily blue, with a large white emblem (“LUCAS OIL PRODUCTS INC”) on the left, a larger rectangle in the upper center (“LUCAS OIL PRO MOTOCROSS”) in white and red, and some blurred sponsor logos.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- Racers are bunched close together; the focal point is just left of center where the leading bikes (#9, #16, #23, #25, #27, #51, #15) are angled slightly toward each other, as if converging.\n- Front tires of most motorcycles are level with each other (nearly on the same horizontal plane), indicating simultaneous motion; back tires are mostly obscured.\n- Relative height: motorcycles occupy roughly the lower two-thirds of the image, with tires aligned to the bottom edge.\n- A tall, cylindrical, bright yellow barrier is visible on the far left.\n- The large billboard dominates the top one-third, receding into the distance above the riders.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The image is photorealistic with a dynamic, high-energy composition and strong sense of movement — dust and dirt fly into the air, and some tires are slightly airborne.\n- Riders' postures convey action, leaning forward and gripping handlebars.\n- Protective gear (helmets, gloves, boots, goggles) is prominent; helmets are rounded, goggle straps visible.\n- Proportions are lifelike; bikes and people are in natural scale relative to each other.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n- Number plates: each primary rider's motorcycle has a large black number on a white background attached to the front and sometimes side of the bike (for instance, “94,” “9,” “16,” “23,” “25,” “27,” “51,” “15”).

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The central focus is a tightly packed group of motocross racers on off-road motorcycles, poised at the start of a race.\n- There are twelve visible racers, each on a dirt bike, forming a staggered horizontal arc across the lower-middle half of the image.\n- Background elements include a large billboard/sign, grassy patches, a segment of a yellow safety barrier, and churned-up dirt — denoting a race track.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- Bikers’ uniforms are highly vibrant, featuring bold solids and graphic patterns in red, yellow, green, black, blue, and white, along with sponsor logos and number plates on the chest and front fender.\n- Motorcycles match or complement the rider uniforms, with color-coordinated body panels and numbers: green (Kawasaki), red (Honda), orange (KTM), blue (Yamaha), yellow (Suzuki), and black/white variants.\n- The dirt on the ground shows heavy texture, in earthy browns, scattered with shadows and chunks kicked up by tires, creating a sense of motion.\n- The billboard background is primarily blue, with a large white emblem (“LUCAS OIL PRODUCTS INC”) on the left, a larger rectangle in the upper center (“LUCAS OIL PRO MOTOCROSS”) in white and red, and some blurred sponsor logos.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- Racers are bunched close together; the focal point is just left of center where the leading bikes (#9, #16, #23, #25, #27, #51, #15) are angled slightly toward each other, as if converging.\n- Front tires of most motorcycles are level with each other (nearly on the same horizontal plane), indicating simultaneous motion; back tires are mostly obscured.\n- Relative height: motorcycles occupy roughly the lower two-thirds of the image, with tires aligned to the bottom edge.\n- A tall, cylindrical, bright yellow barrier is visible on the far left.\n- The large billboard dominates the top one-third, receding into the distance above the riders.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The image is photorealistic with a dynamic, high-energy composition and strong sense of movement — dust and dirt fly into the air, and some tires are slightly airborne.\n- Riders' postures convey action, leaning forward and gripping handlebars.\n- Protective gear (helmets, gloves, boots, goggles) is prominent; helmets are rounded, goggle straps visible.\n- Proportions are lifelike; bikes and people are in natural scale relative to each other.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details:**\n- Number plates: each primary rider's motorcycle has a large black number on a white background attached to the front and sometimes side of the bike (for instance, “94,” “9,” “16,” “23,” “25,” “27,” “51,” “15”). These numbers take up about one-third the width of the bike’s front.\n- Uniform logos: visible brands/sponsors such as SUZUKI, FOX, FLY, and Rockstar are placed prominently on jerseys and helmets.\n- In the background, two large signboards are present:\n  - Left sign: White, crest-shaped, outlined in black with \"Lucas Oil Products Inc\" in red/black with a small American flag/checkered flag motif.\n  - Central sign: Big white block letters on a blue rectangle, with \"LUCAS OIL\" in red, \"PRO MOTOCROSS\" in smaller white/gray.\n  - Above, smaller white text: “PROMOTOCROSS.COM”\n- Dirt track: Churned, granular, rich brown, with deeper shadowed ruts and elevated mounds where bikes have disturbed the earth.\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout Information:**\n- Each bike’s front wheel: circular, with visible spokes, 1/10th the image width.\n- The riders’ bodies cover 2/3 the height of each bike, with slightly bent elbows and legs; helmets slightly larger than the width of the tires.\n- The main arc of motorcycles extends from approximately 5% from the left edge to 95% from the right edge, curving slightly toward the foreground center.\n- Yellow barrier: cylindrical, 1/15th of image width, situated ~5% from the left edge.\n- The billboard sign occupies the full width of the image, starting ~10% from the top edge, covering the upper 25–30% of the image height.\n- Each number plate is rectangular, roughly proportioned 1:1.2 (height:width), and centered on the bike’s front forks.\n\nThis should provide all the geometric, color, and compositional data required for a highly accurate SVG reproduction.",

  "v1_30": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and accurate description of the image, broken down according to your specified points for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n- **Primary Object:** Two F-14 Tomcat fighter jets in flight, viewed from a rear-left angle, above clouds and over the ocean.\n- **Jet in Foreground:** Viewed in ¾ perspective, dominated by swept-back wings, two upward-canted tail fins, large jet engines at the rear, elongated nose, and the cockpit canopy. Most details and markings are visible on this jet.\n- **Jet in Background:** Smaller, higher, and further back in the composition, partially overlapping the horizon and clouds. Its details are less pronounced due to distance.\n- **Background:** Expansive layer of billowy clouds (cumulus formations) with breaks showing the sunlit ocean surface below.\n- **Sunlight:** Warm golden sunlight streams in from the top right, casting highlights and soft shadows on the jets and clouds.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Jets:** Overall light gray with subtle cool/metallic blue undertones. Panel outlines and mechanical details are traced in darker gray or black. Edges of panels and surfaces show light weathering and some yellowish-brown wear.\n- **Markings:** Black and white insignias, numbers, and navy badges; yellow, white, and red warning labels.\n- **Cockpit Canopy:** Transparent with reflective highlights; dark silhouettes of two pilots visible inside.\n- **Clouds:** Voluminous and soft, colored in warm shades—creamy whites, pastel peach, and light gold due to the low-angle sunlight.\n- **Ocean:** Deep twilight blue showing through breaks in the clouds, shimmering with sunlight in gold and white.\n- **Lighting:** Strong contrast between sun-facing (highlighted) and shadowed sides of the aircraft (more blue/gray). The image overall is suffused with orange-pink/golden hues due to sunset or sunrise.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- **Foreground Jet:**\n  - **Wings:** Swept backward at about 35–40°, extending almost parallel to the tail fins.\n  - **Tail Fins:** Two, canted outwards approximately 15°, spaced symmetrically from the jet centerline.\n  - **Fuselage:** Runs diagonally from lower right (nose/cockpit) to upper left (tail).\n  - **Engines:** Two cylindrical exhausts at the rear, aligned with the tail fins.\n  - **Cockpit:** Near the right edge, showing forward tilt toward the viewer.\n  - **Overall Proportion:** Jet fills about 60% of the image width, dominating the lower and central portions.\n- **Background Jet:**\n  - Smaller, positioned upper middle, flying in a similar attitude and orientation, BUT at a higher altitude and further back, giving a sense of depth/perspective.\n- **Clouds/Ocean:**\n  - Clouds cover the bottom ¾ of the image except for sunlit gaps showing water below. Clouds thin out toward the horizon line at the top.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- **Realism:** Photo-realistic rendering with high attention to metallic surface details, accurate reflections, and nuanced edge wear.\n- **Lighting:** Uses warm/rich natural light with visible highlight gradients and cast shadows.\n- **Perspective:** Dynamic, with foreshortening on the jet’s wings and body. Vanishing points converge diagonally toward upper right.\n- **Detail Emphasis:** Focus on technical and mechanical details (rivets, panel lines, decals).\n- **Atmosphere:** Slight haze and bloom around light sources for realism; some motion blur/softness at edges of distant objects.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Nose Number:** Large, black \"101\" on the fuselage below and in front of the cockpit.\n- **Tail Fin (left, foreground jet):**\n  - Large black “41” inside a white diamond with “A” and “A” above/below and “BLACK ACES VF-41\" written in two lines on the base of the fin.\n  - Additional “USS ENTERPRISE” in smaller black text.\n- **National Insignia:** Black U.S. NAVY star-and-bars roundel, mid-fuselage behind the cockpit.\n- **Unit Identifier:** “NAVY” and “VF-41” on the aft fuselage; “F-14A” and “AC” in various places.\n- **Warning Labels:** Yellow rectangles near intakes and on side; other smaller service stencils in gray/white.\n- **Exhausts:** Circular, dark inside, with metallic reflections and faint glows suggesting heat.\n\n---\n\n#### **Geometric / Proportional & Layout Information**\n- **Jet Body (foreground):** Roughly 3.5:1 length to width (excluding wings).\n- **Wings (foreground):** Each wing is trapezoidal, root (at fuselage) is ~0.6x the total length of the jet, wingtip is ~2/3 the root length, wings extend ~45% of jet length backward.\n- **Tail Fins:** Each about 1/3 length of body, set apart by 1/4 jet width at base; inclination outward at ~15°.\n- **Cockpit Canopy:** Oval, extending about 1/8 jet length, slightly raised profile.\n- **Distance to Background Jet:** About 2–2.5x the foreground jet’s length apart, upward and small offset left, with angle and scale indicating perspective recession.\n- **Cloud Layer:** Clouds uniformly distributed, lightest near sun.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\nTwo highly detailed, realistic F-14 Tomcat fighter jets, one large in the foreground with visible navy and squadron markings, flying above a warmly lit cloud layer over the ocean. The composition emphasizes sharp panel lines, reflective cockpit, and detailed tail markings, all under golden sunlight with visible cast shadows and volumetric cloud formations beneath. The perspective and foreshortening demonstrate dynamic aerial movement and depth.\n\n---",

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **Line graph**: The central feature is a stepped blue line plot representing Japan’s GDP (in billion U.S. dollars) for the years 1980 to 2028. The line connects data points marking each year's GDP value. A circular blue dot highlights each data point.\n- **Data labels**: At some data points, above or near the blue dots, black text with the GDP value for that year is shown. Not every year is labeled—selected (not all) years are annotated.\n- **Axes**:\n  - **X-axis (horizontal)**: Runs along the bottom, marking the years. Years (in 2-year increments) are labeled in gray, slanted slightly upward to the right.\n  - **Y-axis (vertical)**: On the left, marks GDP values in increments of 1,000 (1,000 to 7,000). Labeled in gray, grid lines extend horizontally across the plot area at each 1,000 increment.\n- **Grid lines**: Thin, light gray horizontal lines at every 1,000 increment on the Y-axis. These lines run the full width of the chart.\n- **Title and Labels**:\n  - **Chart title**: Bold, centered, black text at the top.\n  - **Y-axis label (\"GDP in billion U.S. dollars\")**: Rotated 90° vertical, along the left-hand side, in gray.\n- **Footnotes/Source text**: Small, gray text at the bottom left (“Source IMF © Statista 2023”), and at the bottom center (“Additional Information: Japan; IMF; 1980 to 2022”).\n\n---\n\n### 2.

  "v1_64": "Certainly! Here is a detailed description focused on all visible aspects to facilitate faithful SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\n- The composition is a side-by-side image split vertically through the center, featuring two individuals positioned from the mid-torso upward.\n- Both are standing upright, facing forward, filling the height of the image.\n- Shoulders, neck, and the upper torso are visible for both figures.\n\n**Left Side Elements:**\n- **Hair:** Loose and naturally wavy, extending to the chest area, with a center parting. The hair is voluminous and covers the shoulders.\n- **Dress:** The dress has short, transparent, slightly puffed sleeves. The fabric is gathered at the waist by a subtle seam, creating a slight flare below the bust and gentle vertical folds.\n- **Necklace:** A delicate chain necklace is visible, doubling around the neck, with a small cross pendant as a central focal point.\n\n**Right Side Elements:**\n- **Hair:** Short, straight, and parted off-center. The length is above the shoulders, ending around the neck. The ends of the hair curve slightly inward.\n- **Dress:** Features a high, rounded neckline and short sleeves. The fabric covers the upper torso, tightly fitting the shoulders and sleeves.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n**Backgrounds:**\n- **Left:** Deep charcoal/black with faint text partially visible in white at the top.\n- **Right:** Pale gray with faint, sketch-like illustrations suggesting an architectural backdrop.\n\n**Left Side:**\n- **Hair:** Rich chocolate brown with subtle highlights.\n- **Dress:** Solid pastel yellow with a slightly translucent overlay, creating a soft mesh or tulle texture. The dress has a subtle sheen and gentle folds.\n- **Necklace:** Silver color, smooth and reflective.\n\n**Right Side:**\n- **Hair:** Medium brown at the roots with lighter, soft blonde highlights, giving a gentle ombre effect.\n- **Dress:** White satin-like fabric, glossy in texture, densely decorated with a pattern of pink, red, and occasionally brown floral and leaf motifs. The flowers and leaves are various shapes and sizes, scattered evenly across the visible fabric with high detail and realistic color gradation.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- The image is split precisely in half, with each individual occupying a vertical 50%.\n- Both figures are centrally positioned within each half, with similar cropping: the top of the head is nearly at the upper edge, and the base is slightly below the bust line.\n- Shoulders are nearly parallel to the image edge, with only subtle variations in posture.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Photorealistic:** The image is a photograph with clear details and natural lighting, capturing fabric textures, color nuances, and the natural flow of hair.\n- **Fashion Portrait:** Lighting highlights the details of both outfits and textures without harsh shadows.\n- **Contrast:** The left side has a darker background, making the yellow dress and silver necklace stand out. The right side uses a pale background that softly blends with the colors in the dress pattern.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details**\n\n**Left Side:**\n- **Necklace:** The small cross pendant is smooth, symmetrical, and slightly reflective.\n- **Partial Background Text:** White sans-serif uppercase letters appear near the top. Only portions are visible: \"THE CINEMA S...\" and \"MA...\" (likely event or venue text).\n- **Dress Details:** Soft gathering at the waist, subtle seam lines.\n\n**Right Side:**\n- **Floral Motifs:** The pattern is detailed, with each flower stem and leaf outlined in fine lines and filled with varying shades of pink, red, green, and brown. The distribution is denser around the bust and slightly more spaced on the sleeves.\n- **No visible jewelry or accessories.**\n- **Dress Fit:** The sleeves and body of the dress are smooth and form-fitting without gathered fabric.\n\n**Proportions and Layout:**\n- Both subjects are proportionally similar, with head, shoulder, and torso placement nearly symmetrical relative to the vertical split.\n- The left subject's hair extends just past the bottom of the visible area, while the right is cropped well above.\n- The floral dress neckline sits slightly higher than the yellow dress’s neckline.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Notes for SVG Recreation:**\n\n- Use a sharp vertical split to delineate both halves.\n- For the left: echo the softly crinkled look of the tulle, and add subtle mesh texture lines in the sleeve and bodice area; ensure necklace and pendant are proportionately small and centered near the collarbone.\n- For the right: implement a repeated floral vector motif with natural, uneven spacing — some flowers should overlap, vary flower sizes (some ~3% of the dress width, some ~8%), and mix stems, petals, and leaves.\n- Ensure realistic hair rendering: full, loose waves for the left (length to bust), smoother, chin-length contours for the right.\n- Both should be depicted with necks visible, collarbones subtly shown where possible.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need further technical breakdowns or example SVG paths!",
  "v1_65": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description for recreating the image as an SVG, strictly excluding any reference to the blurred face:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- **Female Figure (Bust-Up):** The primary object is the upper torso of a woman standing with her left hand placed flat over her upper chest and her right hand clutching a gold statuette (Academy Award / Oscar).\n- **Oscar Statuette:** The statuette is held in the right hand, centrally positioned near chest level, featuring a stylized human figure standing on a round black base.\n- **Dress:** The garment is white, sleeveless, with delicate thin spaghetti straps and a feathery or fringed texture. The neckline gently curves across the chest.\n- **Long Hair:** Dark brown to black wavy hair falls over the right shoulder (viewer’s left) with some locks going behind the left shoulder and a sparkling headband visible along the crown.\n- **Jewelry:** A large gemstone ring on the left ring finger, long dangling earrings, and a glittering headband.\n- **Microphone:** Prominently in the lower center foreground—a cylindrical, matte black microphone round at the top, extending upward but not reaching shoulder height.\n- **Background:** The background is an out-of-focus view of a wide, gold-lit stage or aisle, with two sharply converging parallel lines suggesting a path or walkway. The main colors are warm browns, golds, and hints of yellow.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- **Skin:** Light, natural skin tone with smooth texture.\n- **Dress:** Pure white, with a soft, semi-sheer appearance and a tactile, almost fluffy or feathery fringe that extends outward at the edges.\n- **Oscar:** Highly reflective gold for the statuette, with a metallic sheen. The base is solid black, smooth, and polished.\n- **Microphone:** Deep black, matte texture.\n- **Hair:** Dark brown-black, glossy with volumized loose waves.\n- **Background:** Gradient tones of golden brown, tan, and muted ochre with a blurred and bokeh-like texture emphasizing depth.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The woman occupies the vertical center and extends from lower chest to just above the head.\n- The Oscar is held on the right side (viewer’s left) at roughly chest height.\n- The left hand (viewer’s right) is pressed against the collarbone/sternum, fingers elegantly spread.\n- The microphone is centered, in immediate foreground, and positioned between the woman and the viewer but below the Oscar.\n- The background walkway converges toward the top center, emphasizing perspective and drawing eye to the subject.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- **Photorealistic style:** Crisp details on fabric, hands, jewelry, and Oscar.\n- **Soft focus/background bokeh:** The background is blurred, ensuring the foreground subject stands out distinctly.\n- **High contrasts:** Reflective surfaces (Oscar, jewelry, and hair) catch light, while fabric diffuses it.\n- **Elegant, formal motif:** The attire and setting evoke a prestigious or high-fashion environment.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details:**\n- **Oscar Statuette:** Depicts a classical stylized human male holding a sword across the front, characteristic of the Academy Awards trophy.\n- **No visible text** on the Oscar base in this view.\n- **Jewelry details:** The ring is large, possibly a rectangular or oval gemstone surrounded by smaller stones; earrings are linear and drop below the earlobe, sparkling.\n- **Dress details:** Feathered or fringed elements radiate outward, especially around the arms and torso, creating a textured lower border and dynamic edge.\n\n**Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout Information:**\n- **Figure Proportion:** The torso and arms make up the bulk of the vertical frame; width is about half the frame, with arms extending slightly outward.\n- **Oscar Size:** About one-sixth the total height shown; the statuette is vertical with the human figure shape clearly visible.\n- **Microphone:** Centered horizontally, its top aligns with the lower part of the Oscar and does not obscure any key elements.\n- **Dress Neckline:** A gentle horizontal curve, with very thin straps barely visible against the skin; feathers or fringe extend unevenly past arms and lower torso.\n- **Headband:** Thin, silver/white, arched upward across the scalp's apex from ear to ear.\n- **Stage Lines:** The gold-brown lines in the background are straight and parallel, forming a trapezoidal path converging as they recede upward in the frame.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed account covers all elements necessary for precise SVG recreation of the image, focusing on clarity, proportion, color, position, and styling while omitting the blurred face.",

Surfaces are matte with subtle shadows accentuating carvings.\n- **Water:** Bright turquoise with subtle gradient toward light aqua nearer the waterfall, and light foam where the water falls.\n- **Statues:** The same pale stone as the façade; smooth texture; deep shadows in recesses highlight three-dimensional form.\n- **Background Façade:** Slightly warmer white/ivory tone compared to pool rocks.\n- **Right Side Building:** Warm, terracotta orange, smooth stucco with white window frames.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Vertical Layout:**\n  - Bottom quarter: Pool water.\n  - Middle half: Rock formation and statues set atop rocks.\n  - Upper quarter: Architectural façade with three large vertical niches aligned above rocks.\n- **Horizontal Layout:**\n  - Fountain pool occupies the lower width edge-to-edge.\n  - Central axis: Tallest rock formation and largest, most prominent statue align with the central niche of the façade.\n  - Left and right sides: Smaller rock clusters and statues, receding in height and prominence.\n  - Far right: Cropped, flat wall of the adjacent orange building.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Baroque Architectural Style:** Highly ornate, dynamic, and dramatic effect. Heavy use of curves, classical columns, sculptural embellishment, and deep set niches.\n- **Sculptural Group:** High-relief, naturalistic portrayal of human anatomy and mythological themes; figures are in dramatic, flowing motion, common in Baroque art.\n- **Rocks:** Irregular geometric shapes with rough faceted texture, suggesting natural stone but carefully composed for visual drama.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n\n- **No visible text** in this image section, though the actual location includes inscriptions higher up (not visible here).\n- **Statues' details:**\n  - The central figure (Oceanus/Neptune) holds a staff or trident (not clearly visible here) and stands atop a large shell chariot.\n  - Sea horses (hippocamps) with rearing poses; one to the left, one to the right; guided by muscular male figures (tritons).\n  - The two other alcove statues flanking the central figure represent Abundance and Health, each holding their own symbols (possibly amphora and wreath; details limited by image).\n- **Water Movement Details:** The main waterfall has a straight, horizontal drop with white foamy water at the base, and smaller jets and rivulets emerging among the rocks.\n\n---\n\n### **Geometric Details and Proportions for SVG:**\n\n- **Image Ratio:** Roughly 16:9 (landscape).\n- **Pool:** Elliptical shape spanning roughly 90% of width; water edge irregular, mimicking the rocks.\n- **Main Central Statue:** Positioned at image center, occupying about 1/5 the image height, elevated on rocks.\n- **Horizontal Columns:** Four in total, equally spaced, divide the wall into three main bays.\n- **Rock Formation:** Spans entire width above the pool, with several peaks but tallest at center.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is the Trevi Fountain in Rome, presented in daytime, straight-on view. The composition centers a grand marble Baroque fountain against an ornate façade: a large turquoise pool below, jagged pale rockwork in the midground, and dramatic mythological marble statues in the center, all backed by a white-stone palatial wall with columns and niches. Statues are elevated and densely grouped, with the tallest and most prominent centrally positioned. Shadows model the deep reliefs, and water animation is visible in the bright pool and active waterfall. No text is present; the scene is iconic, highly detailed, and full of movement both in architecture and sculpture, with a palette of pale stone and blue-green water accented by a touch of adjacent orange building edge at the far right.",

  "v1_80": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and precise description focusing on all visible elements except for the intentionally blurred area:\n\n---\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements:**\n- The main focus is a British £10 banknote, placed diagonally with its long side running from bottom-left to top-right.\n- Prominent on the note are intricate geometric patterns, a detailed architectural illustration (the building's facade), ornate line designs, security features (such as a clear rectangular window and a metallic patch), and scripted text.\n- The note’s corners are rounded, consistent with standard currency proportions (aspect ratio approx. 2:1, width to height).\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties:**\n- Dominant colors are warm peaches, oranges, tans, and browns, with gradients transitioning softly between areas.\n- Fine yellow, orange, and pink linework forms guilloche security designs and flourishes, often interweaving.\n- The building illustration is rendered in a semi-transparent salmon and biscuit hue, with fine hatch lines for shading.\n- Shadowing and three-dimensional effects lend realism, particularly around the text and ornate elements.\n- Metallic accents (notably lower left) include a small golden “Big Ben”-like tower with reflective qualities.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning:**\n- The “Bank of England” script is placed horizontally near the upper left in flowing black calligraphy, slightly slanted but running mostly parallel to the banknote’s top edge.\n- Below and slightly right is the text “Ten Pounds” (the denomination), in a prominent, large black cursive: “Ten” sits above “Pounds,” both set over the image of the classical building (centered in the note’s lower third).\n- The lower left area contains a detailed metallic foil patch, a gold color and partially transparent with a complex architectural motif—likely Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben).\n- Guilloche patterns—the swirling, intricate linework—are spread across the upper left and gently frame the Bank’s name, extending to the center and housing the building illustration.\n- The background architecture (a neoclassical building) occupies the central area of the banknote, behind the main text, sized to take up roughly a third of the note’s height.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics:**\n- The design is highly detailed, formal, and symmetrical, characteristic of modern banknote engraving style.\n- Linework is precise and clean, forming interlacing security patterns and flourishes that deter duplication.\n- Cursive scripts are elegant and airy, contrasting with the more rigid geometric backgrounds.\n- The architectural illustration is finely shaded, emphasizing both depth and a sense of solidity.\n- Metallic and transparent security features are seamlessly integrated, and show iridescent or holographic effects.\n\n**5.

  "v1_87": "Certainly, here is a comprehensive and precise description of the image for accurate SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n- The main object is a wooden bookshelf filled with books arranged in three horizontal rows (shelves).\n- All visible books are upright with their spines facing outward.\n- Across all three shelves, the books are tightly packed together, with virtually no horizontal gaps between them.\n- Most books are rectangular cuboids (standard book form), but thickness varies.\n- There are no decorative items, plants, or other non-book items visible.\n- Several fabric bookmarks/tassels, mostly white or red, protrude from the tops or bottoms of some books.\n\n## 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n- **Book Spines:** Dominant colors are red, dark blue, emerald/dark green, and black. Some spines are lighter blue, sky blue, brown, or maroon, with a few yellow and gold design elements.\n- **Spine Text:** Most titles and text are gold, white, or yellow, with occasional red or blue. Serif and sans-serif fonts appear. Some books feature Christian symbols (crosses) in white or gold.\n- **Textures:** Many spines have a faux-leather or leather grain/texture, with visible embossing or gold/leather stamping for titles and symbols. Some spines are smooth, glossy, or matte, depending on the material.\n- **Books:** Some book spines contain decorative borders, lines, or panels in gold/white.\n- **Bookshelf:** The shelf is a light-to-medium natural wood, with visible vertical and horizontal lines for each shelf and divider. The shelves have a flat, smooth texture.\n\n## 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n- **Shelves:** \n  - Three evenly spaced horizontal shelves span the image; the books fill the complete horizontal length.\n  - The shelves are rectangular boxes with height slightly larger than the tallest book on each shelf.\n- **Books:** \n  - All stand vertically, upright against the back of the shelf, with heights and thicknesses varying notably between books (ranging from slim to thick).\n  - The height of books is relatively consistent within each shelf but varies more noticeably across shelves.\n  - Book widths (thickness) also vary, with some books about 2x or 3x the width of the thinnest.\n  - Some thicker books are prominent, e.g., the second red book from the left on the bottom shelf and a thick green book mid-bottom.\n- **Arrangement:** \n  - Books are flush with one another, filling the horizontal span with little to no visible gaps.\n  - Some bookmarks are draped over the edges of the shelves.\n\n## 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n- **Photorealistic Style:** The image is a clear color photograph, not an illustration or drawing.\n- **Geometric Precision:** Books are precise rectangles standing upright, mostly aligned at the base with small height variations.\n- **Composition:** The image is tightly cropped, showing only the shelves and books, no background or floor.\n- **Perspective:** The camera/viewer is facing directly at the bookshelf front-on, with minimal perspective distortion.\n- **Lighting:** Soft indoor lighting provides even illumination across spines, but not enough for strong reflections or glare. There are mild shadows between some books and shelves.\n\n## 5. Text, Symbols, Specific Details\n- **Titles and Languages:** \n  - Identifiable words on spines include \"Biblia\", \"Bible\", \"Bibel\", \"Biblija\", \"Bibelen\", \"Biblia Święta\", \"Holy Bible\", \"Sväté Písmo\", etc., representing \"Bible\" in many languages.\n  - Other readable words: \"Testamenti i Ri\", \"Novo zákon\", \"Apokrifa\", \"Pismo Święte\", etc.\n- **Symbols:**\n  - Several spines have white/gold crosses or Christian symbols (at least four visible).\n  - Decorative horizontal/vertical lines, boxes, or motifs frame some titles.\n- **Formatting:** \n  - Most titles run vertically (top to bottom), but a few run horizontally.\n  - Some titles are centered, while others are left-justified on the spine.\n  - A variety of fonts/styles are used, but most are legible, blocky, and capitalized.\n  - Some spines have publisher logos, numbers, or edition marks embossed at the bottom.\n\n---\n\n## **SVG Construction Advice**\n\n**Books:**\n- Represent each book as a precisely placed vertical rectangle.\n- Use varying widths (approx. 20-60px per book at typical SVG scale); heights vary per shelf (but are similar among books on a single shelf).\n- Set three \"rows\" but align all spines flush to a virtual base line on each shelf.\n- Apply base colors of maroon/red, deep blue, black, dark green, with occasional yellow/cream/blue, in a pseudo-random but balanced sequence.\n- Overlay each rectangle with text elements (dominantly \"BIBLIA\", \"BIBLE\", or the local equivalent), colored primarily gold, white, or yellow using an SVG font.\n- Add thin lines or crosses as simple SVG paths for symbolism, referencing visible spine designs.\n\n**Bookshelf:**\n- Construct shelves as thick-edged rectangles beneath each row, colored with a warm, pale-to-medium wood gradient/flat fill.\n- Place thin vertical dividers/side edges at appropriate places (start and end of shelves).\n\n**Details:**\n- Add narrow, thin vertical/diagonal bookmarks (SVG lines) in white/red/yellow emerging from select books' tops, sometimes extending down the book front.\n- For realism, shapes for symbols (crosses) can be drawn as white or gold path elements.\n- Spacing between books should be minimal or zero.\n- Make sure all uppercase text is vertical or horizontal to match the majority layout.\n- For proportion: Each shelf approx. 1/3 of vertical SVG canvas; number of books per shelf (approx): Top 18, Middle 18, Bottom 17 (exact count may vary per actual design).\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Elements**\n\n| Layer         | Element Type    | Count   | Proportion/Position                 | Color/Main Textures |\n|---------------|----------------|---------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Back         | Shelf           | 3       | Evenly divided horizontal bands     | Pale/medium brown  |\n| Rows         | Book (rect)     | ~18/layer| Aligned rectangles, heights vary    | Red, blue, black, green, others |\n| Foreground   | Text            | 1/book  | Vertical/horizontal on spine        | Gold, white, yellow |\n| Symbols      | Cross/decor     | Several | Overlay on select books             | White/gold         |\n| Detail       | Bookmark        | 6-8     | Thin lines near top/bottom          | White/red/yellow   |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need a specification in a different format (e.g., step-by-step SVG coordinates) or further breakdown!",

The curl at each corner is depicted as a circular arc, representing the rolled paper, with a thin blue outline.\n- The parchment area is bordered by thin blue lines (top and left edges) that trace part of the curl.\n- The background outside the scroll is a dark wooden table texture.\n- The main content is centrally aligned black text across three lines, written in an ornate, calligraphy-style typeface resembling historical handwriting.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n- **Background:** Deep brown, wood-grain texture (horizontal, slightly diagonal lines and variations in color).\n- **Scroll / Parchment:** Light tan or beige, with a subtle fabric or canvas-like weave/texture effect.\n- **Borders & Scroll Curls:** Thin blue lines (HEX #3573BA or similar), suggesting ink or ribbon.\n- **Text:** Solid black (#000000), crisp, with no shadow or embellishment.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n- The scroll/parchment takes up approximately 92% of the total image width and 80% of image height, centered horizontally and aligned toward the top (leaving more wood at the bottom).\n- The left and right scroll curls are circular: each about 1/8 of the parchment height in diameter, intruding slightly into the parchment area by about 1/3 of their diameter.\n- Blue borders run vertically down the left edge (from bottom to below the curl) and horizontally across the top (from the left curl to the right curl). No blue line across the bottom or right side.\n- The text is centrally aligned, with generous top and bottom margins inside the parchment.\n- The first line (\"Connecticut law of 1642\") is separated from the main body of text with slightly more vertical spacing.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n- The visual style mimics an antique, colonial-era legal document:\n  - The parchment has soft, rounded corners except where there are curled scrolls, which are noticeably circular and protruding.\n  - The texture conveys age—something like rough cloth or parchment, not perfectly smooth.\n  - The blue lines are thin and simple, giving a hand-drawn impression.\n  - The font is cursive, stylized with flourishes, and varies in line thickness, emulating calligraphy or old print.\n  - The whole presentation has a formal yet somewhat rustic feel.\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n- **Text Content and Formatting:**\n\n  (All centrally aligned, with capital letters and long \"s\" where used in the font)\n\n  ```\n  Connecticut law of 1642\n\n  If any man or woman be a witch—\n  that is, hath or consulteth with a\n  familiar spirit—they shall be put to\n  death\n  ```\n\n- Dashes used are long, en dash/em dash length.\n- All punctuation is standard.\n- The font is consistent for all text; size of \"Connecticut law of 1642\" is slightly larger (~20–25% larger than body text).\n- The text area centers in the available parchment, leaving at least 1/10 of parchment height as margin at both top and bottom, and similar side margins.\n\n**Proportions and Layout Information for Reproduction**\n- **Overall image aspect ratio:** approximately 4:3 (e.g., 960x720 px).\n- **Parchment:** Rectangle, width ~88–92% of canvas, height ~80–83%, positioned evenly top/bottom and left/right.\n- **Scroll curls:** Radius ~10–12% of parchment height, centered at the top corners, with thin blue outline and transparent fill. Left/right edge curls are symmetrical.\n- **Blue borders:** 0.8–1% of image width in thickness.\n- **Wooden border:** Visible above and below the parchment as a background, with a subtle diagonal grain.\n- **Text box:** 70–75% of parchment width, centered.\n- **Font style:** Resembles Blackletter or Old Script (e.g. “IM Fell” or “Cloister Black”).\n- **Paragraph line spacing:** ~1.3x font height.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Element         | Shape/Size            | Position                         | Color/Texture         |\n|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Background      | Rectangular           | Full image                       | Dark brown wood-grain |\n| Parchment       | Rounded rectangle     | Centered, 88–92% W, 80–83% H     | Beige, woven texture  |\n| Left scroll     | Partial circle        | Top-left corner, r=10–12% of H   | Thin blue outline     |\n| Right scroll    | Partial circle        | Top-right corner, same size      | Thin blue outline     |\n| Blue border     | Line                  | Top & left parchment edges       | Thin blue            |\n| Main text       | 3 lines, calligraphic | Center of parchment, centered    | Black, cursive        |\n\n---\n\nThis should provide all the geometric, color, style, and layout details to guide SVG recreation with high fidelity.

  "v1_95": "Certainly! Here is a detailed and comprehensive description of the image, intended for accurate SVG reconstruction:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements\n\n- **License Plate**: The primary object in the image is a rectangular license plate situated centrally and slightly towards the lower half of the main frame.\n- **Car Grille/Background**: Behind the license plate, there's a horizontal, grille-like pattern indicating the front of a car, darker in shade.\n- **Application UI Elements**: The image is displayed in a classic Windows application window (possibly MATLAB), showing a menu bar at the top and a light gray background outside the image.\n\n### 2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties\n\n- **Color Palette**: The main image (license plate and car) is in grayscale (black and white). The UI/frame outside the image is light gray.\n- **Blurring Effect**: The entire central image is heavily motion-blurred (diagonal blur from upper left to lower right), causing all elements to be indistinct and smeared.\n- **License Plate**: The plate itself is a medium/light gray rectangle with slightly rounded corners and a thin dark border.\n- **Text/Numbers**: Dark, bold alphanumeric characters are present on the license plate, highly blurred.\n- **Visual Texture**: The blur gives a smooth, streaked appearance to what normally would be hard lines and shapes.\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning\n\n- **License Plate**: Placed roughly at the center, occupying most of the middle-lower portion (about 60% width, 40% height of the inner image area).\n- **Text Positioning**: Large text/numbers, aligned horizontally across the central plate, with a dash/hyphen separating two groups of characters.\n- **UI Elements**: \n  - Menu bar at the very top (File, Edit, View, Insert, Tools, Desktop, Window, Help).\n  - Standard toolbar icons beneath the menu bar (file open, save, hand, pointer, etc.).\n  - The main image is centered on the application’s canvas, with a light gray background filling the unused areas around it.\n\n### 4. Style and Artistic Characteristics\n\n- **Photorealism**: The visual content aims for realism but is heavily compromised by the strong diagonal motion blur.\n- **Digital Blur**: The diagonal streaks make the plate, the car’s grille, and even the text almost illegible.\n- **UI Style**: Classic Windows application GUI, rectangular window, minimal flat color (system gray).\n\n### 5. Text, Symbols, or Specific Details\n\n- **Plate Characters**: Large, black, bold, sans-serif or block font. The characters appear as follows (best discernible guess due to blur):\n  - Left group: \"A2D-\" (the \"2\" could be a \"Z\" or similar character), about 40% of plate width.\n  - Right group: \"632\", about 40% of plate width.\n  - Hyphen \"-\" is between the groups, centered on the plate.\n- **Smaller Text**: There appears to be a smaller line of text or symbol below the main characters on the plate, running parallel, but it is illegible due to the blur.\n- **Application Text**: The menu bar at the very top, with the default options for a Windows app: File, Edit, View, Insert, Tools, Desktop, Window, Help.\n- **Toolbar Icons**: Small and classic (file, save, pointer, zoom in/out, hand, color palette, etc.), immediately below the menu bar.\n\n### 6. Geometric Details, Proportions, and Layout\n\n- **Image Aspect Ratio**: Approximate ratio 4:3 (wider than tall).\n- **License Plate**:\n  - Occupies roughly 60% of the image width and 40% of its height.\n  - Centered horizontally, vertically in the lower middle region of the image.\n  - Corners slightly rounded.\n- **Text Proportion**:\n  - Character height: ~60% of plate height.\n  - Hyphen/dash: horizontally centered, smaller than characters.\n  - Spacing: Even, slightly more space between the two groups.\n- **Motion Blur**:\n  - Direction: From top-left to bottom-right (about a 45-degree angle).\n  - Spread: Entire plate and immediate nearby area, with fading streaks radiating outward from the center.\n- **Window Frame**:\n  - Light gray rectangle with a thicker top section for the menu/toolbars.\n  - The actual image has a black frame around it (photo margin).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of SVG Considerations**\n\n- Reproduce a gray rectangular license plate at the center, on a horizontally lined dark background (replicating a car grille).\n- Overlay slightly rounded, large, black, sans-serif text: \"A2D-632\" (best approximation), split by a hyphen.\n- Add a highly prominent diagonal motion blur effect, streaking all elements from top left to bottom right.\n- Include a software window frame: light gray outer rectangle, menu bar at top (\"File Edit View Insert Tools Desktop Window Help\") and a toolbar below with small classic icons.\n- The picture should have a 4:3 aspect, with the photo inside a black margin against the overall gray UI window.\n\n---\n\n**If you need further precision (e.g., pixel-level coordinates) or wish to omit the UI and focus solely on the plate and car portion, please specify.**",

On the right, there is a sliver of a laptop/computer screen with a blue gradient showing.\n- **Book Cover Elements:**\n    - **Main Graphic:**  \n      An abstract, impressionistic cityscape with mid-rise and tall buildings, painted in blocky rectangles, occupies the bottom third to half of the cover. On the left, a diagonal, faint, and painterly bridge element extends from the bottom left toward mid-center.\n    - **Text Elements:**  \n      - At the top center, small black Chinese characters give the author: **\"马虫——著\"**\n      - Large, bold black Chinese text roughly center-top: **\"细细密密的光\"**\n      - Below it in smaller, lighter, spaced-out black text:  \n        **\"每个人都有自己的困境，  \n        却总会被光亮吸引，身不由己地慢慢靠近\"**\n        \n### 2. **Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Background Gradient:**\n  - Ocher, pale gold, yellow, and light peach/pink spread with brush-texture effects and semi-transparent transitions.\n  - Some thicker impasto-like strokes are visible on the left and right edges, giving a canvas/oil-paint look.\n- **Cityscape:**\n  - Buildings are painted with vertical oblong rectangles and vary in color: deep purples, reds, burgundy, orange, blue-violet, and some whites, layered with visible brushstrokes.\n  - Many white/yellow/blue horizontal lines suggest windows, further highlighted with slightly reflective colors.\n  - The bridge (bottom left) is rendered in more closely spaced red/burgundy lines, semi-transparent over the cityscape.\n- **Text:**\n  - All text is black and overlays the painted background. The largest text is bold and clear, the rest smaller and lighter, sans-serif font.\n  - The author’s name and 'author' mark are separated by a horizontal line.\n\n### 3. **Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n- **Book Boundaries:**  \n  The book forms a near-rectangle, with the visible left edge gently curved toward the reader.  \n  The book fills most of the image, with the left and top edge running at a slight angle.\n- **Cityscape:**  \n  - The buildings cluster from the left edge to about two-thirds of the way right, their heights decreasing from right (tallest, near center-right) to left.\n  - The bridge emerges from the bottom left, leading right-upward, but fades before the book’s center.\n- **Text Placement:**  \n  - The large title text is horizontally centered, its vertical midpoint roughly in the upper third.\n  - The subtitle block is centered beneath the main title.\n  - The author name is upper-center, smaller, with a long dash before “著”.\n\n### 4. **Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- **Illustrative Style:**\n  - Heavily painterly, impasto, and impressionistic. No sharp lines; all building and background elements are created with visible brushstrokes.\n  - The buildings are suggested rather than realistic, using stacks of mostly rectangular/rounded rectangles, often overlapping.\n  - The bridge is loosely defined, with lines that bleed into the background.\n- **Typography:**\n  - Clean, sans-serif, and modern typefaces, with clear hierarchy based on font size and weight.\n  - All text is left flat in color, without gradients, shadow, or effects.\n- **Color Palette:**\n  - Warm and luminous: ocher, gold, yellow, peach, with purples and reds for contrast in the cityscape.\n  - Accents of blue add depth in windows and buildings.\n\n### 5. **Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n\n- **Chinese Text:**\n    - **Top:**  \n      ```\n      马虫          ——著\n      ```\n      (Author name at left, a long dash, and “著” (author) at right.)\n    - **Title (centered, bold):**\n      ```\n      细细密密的光\n      ```\n    - **Subtitle (smaller, two lines, lighter):**\n      ```\n      每个人都有自己的困境，\n      却总会被光亮吸引，身不由己地慢慢靠近\n      ```\n- **Details in Buildings:**\n    - Rectangular, slightly tapered forms; each window is a horizontal rectangle, with placement both even and somewhat randomized.\n    - The tallest building is about 1/4 the book’s cover height and is right-of-center.\n- **Other Background:**\n    - At the top, green heart-shaped leaves overlap, with midrib and veins visible (Monstera/Philodendron-like).\n    - Right edge shows a black laptop casing and a blue, blurred screen, with a vertical division.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary in SVG Terms:**\n\n- **Main layout:** Rectangle for the book, angled; background rectangles and polygons for buildings stacked/layered; color-gradient background. Painterly effects with added SVG filter or masks for visible brushstroke effect. Overlay all text elements in specific positions, in sans-serif font, with proportional sizing.\n- **Building proportions:**  \n  Buildings range from 1/10 to 1/4 the cover height, widths vary from 1/30 to 1/8 the cover width, spaced and overlapped.\n- **Bridge Dividers:**  \n  Diagonal, semi-transparent lines, curved slightly.\n\n---\n\nIf you need **precise coordinates, proportions, or font-size estimates**, please specify your canvas size and I’ll help you lay out every element in SVG coordinates.

  "v1_98": "Certainly! Here is a precise and comprehensive description of the given image, focusing on the aspects needed for SVG recreation:\n\n---\n\n**1. Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**  \n- The image displays a Robinson-projection style world map silhouette with only the shapes of continents and large islands shown (no country borders, labels, or fine geographic detail apart from coastlines and a few large inland lakes).\n- Asia is highlighted in solid red; all other landmasses are in solid white.\n- The map includes all seven continents, with clearly delineated coastlines and separation between them (e.g., gaps for oceans and seas).\n- The outline of each continent is sharp and well defined; there are no internal boundaries or topographical details.\n- Small secondary islands are included where proximate to the main landmasses.\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**  \n- **Asia:** solid fill in bright red (#FF0000 or equivalent).\n- **All other landmasses/continents:** solid fill in white (#FFFFFF).\n- **Oceans/background:** solid medium-dark gray (#606060 or similar); no gradient, pattern, or texture.\n- **Separation:** Thin, consistent black outlines (~1-2px relative to the image size) edge every landmass, neatly defining coasts and the highlighted continent. These outlines are the only lines visible.\n- **No shadows, gradients, or additional visual effects** are seen beyond pure flat fills.\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**  \n- **Projection/layout:** The map uses a typical rectangular, pseudo-cylindrical projection (like Robinson or Miller), so the globe is \"flattened\" with distortion at the poles.\n- **Asia** appears to the right-central side of the image, extending from the far left (Ural region near Europe) across the top-center, to the right edge (Japan and Eastern Russia).\n- **Europe** is immediately left of Asia, separated by the Ural line.\n- **Africa** is centered beneath Europe, fully visible, not overlapping with Asia.\n- **North America** is at the top left quadrant; **South America** is bottom left; both are fully in white.\n- **Australia** is at the bottom right quadrant, shown in white.\n- Spacing between the continents reflects their positions on a standard world map, though there are minor distortions due to the projection.\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**  \n- **Minimalist, modern, infographic-like:** Only silhouettes with no country borders, gridlines, or decorative elements.\n- **No text** annotations, compass roses, or legends appear.\n- The design is intentionally flat for clarity and contrast; only two fill colors plus border lines are used.\n- Shapes are scaled such that the entire map nearly fits the height of the image with some margin on all sides, horizontally centered.\n\n**5.

Main Objects, Shapes, and Elements**\n\nThe image is a food web diagram depicting various marine and coastal animals and their feeding relationships, connected with solid black arrows indicating the flow of energy (who-eats-whom). There are 13 main illustrated objects (organisms), each with a corresponding label. These include both animals and plant-like elements, arranged spatially with arrows radiating between them. The elements are as follows (listed approximately from top left to bottom right):\n\n- Blue whale\n- Seagull\n- Leopard seal\n- Fish\n- Krill\n- Zooplankton\n- Phytoplankton\n- Seaweed\n- Penguin\n- Killer whale\n- Elephant seal\n- Squid\n- Crab\n\nEach animal or organism is depicted as a cartoon-like, simple illustration, generally in left or right profile view.\n\n---\n\n**2. Colors, Textures, and Visual Properties**\n\n- **Blue whale**: Large, blue-gradient (light to dark blue on top, with lighter bluish gray bottom), smooth texture, simplified details, small black eye, several ventral pleats indicated with curving black lines.\n- **Seagull**: White body, gray wings (one, in darker gray, visible), yellow beak, red legs and feet, and black at wing tips and tail.\n- **Leopard seal**: Medium blue-gray, streamlined body, black spots, visible mouth with small teeth, one black eye visible.\n- **Killer whale**: Black upper body, white underbelly, white side eye patch and underside patch, tall gray dorsal fin.\n- **Elephant seal**: Brown body, rounded, with large pronounced nose/muzzle, one lighter-tan flipper, black eye.\n- **Penguin**: Black back, white belly, orange/yellow beak/feet/patches, black flippers pointing out.\n- **Fish**: Bright blue with darker stripes along body, yellow fins and tail, white underbelly, expressive black eye, small red gill line.\n- **Krill**: Segmented, orange-brown elliptical body with white underbelly, long antennae, visible legs, small black eye.\n- **Squid**: Elongated light blue-lavender body, two long arms, shorter tentacles, dark blue spots, triangular dorsal fin.\n- **Crab**: Red shell, orange tint on legs, black-tipped claws, beady black eyes on eyestalks.\n- **Zooplankton**: Clustered oval and irregular shapes (red, orange, green, yellow) with black lines, legs/antennules, one with visible eye dot.\n- **Phytoplankton**: Green, various geometric forms (trees, triangle, ellipse, coil), simple and outlined in black.\n- **Seaweed**: Green, three separate blades with simple undulating lines and cut edges, thick clustered stem base.\n\nArrows: All arrows are solid, black single-headed, of uniform stroke width, angular or curved as required by layout.\n\nLabels: Each organism is labeled immediately above, below, or beside it in black sans-serif type.\n\n---\n\n**3. Spatial Relationships and Positioning**\n\n**General layout (clockwise, from top):**\n- Top left: Blue whale (largest object)\n  - Mid-left: Seagull (just right and below Blue whale)\n  - Lower left: Fish; to its right are Krill and then Zooplankton/Phytoplankton/Seaweed clustered at the lower left/bottom.\n- Center: Leopard seal, slightly down and right from blue whale.\n- Directly right of leopard seal: Penguin.\n- Center-right: Killer whale (top right), below it Elephant seal, then further down Squid to the right, and bottom right Crab.\n- Zooplankton at bottom left above Phytoplankton and next to Krill; Seaweed to right of phytoplankton.\n\n**Relative sizes:**\n- Blue whale is the largest, takes up about 1/5 of total width.\n- Seagull about 1/4 the width of blue whale.\n- Killer whale, elephant seal, leopard seal: similar size, smaller than blue whale.\n- Crab, penguin, fish, squid: smaller, about the size of seagull or slightly smaller.\n- Krill, zooplankton, phytoplankton: considerably smaller, with phytoplankton being the smallest.\n\n**Specific Arrow Paths:**\n- Each arrow clearly indicates direction (who eats whom) starting from prey to predator. For instance:\n  - Zooplankton —> Krill, Fish, Blue whale\n  - Phytoplankton —> Zooplankton, Krill\n  - Seaweed —> Crab\n  - Fish —> Seagull, Penguin, Leopard seal\n  - Krill —> Fish, Blue whale, Penguin, Seagull\n  - Squid —> Elephant seal, Penguin, Killer whale\n  - Crab —> Seagull\n  - Penguin —> Leopard seal, Killer whale\n  - Leopard seal —> Killer whale\n  - Elephant seal —> Killer whale\n- Some arrows overlap, but do not obscure the objects or text.\n\n---\n\n**4. Style and Artistic Characteristics**\n\n- Illustrations: Hand-drawn, cartoon-like, thick black outlines, smooth contours.\n- Colors: Bright, solid fills with minimal shading or texturing; simple gradients (e.g., on blue whale, squid), but not sophisticated rendering.\n- Black single-stroke arrows with triangular heads.\n- Labels: Clean, sans-serif, black, legible and not heavily stylized.\n- Overall: Playful and educational, with simplified biologist-style iconography.\n\n---\n\n**5. Text, Symbols, and Specific Details**\n\n- All text consists of the common names of the depicted animals/plants. No scientific names, all in lowercase except for initial capitals.\n- No additional symbols or legends.\n- No background color—transparent or white.\n\n---\n\n**Geometric/Proportion Details for SVG Recreation:**\n\n- Center the blue whale at the top, spanning roughly 20% width.\n- Place the seagull just right and below blue whale, about 10% width.\n- Main path-line arrows: straight or gently curved, with black stroke and triangular head (arrow size about 1/5 the width of the organism it's coming from).\n- All organisms should fit into a roughly circular/oval compositional layout with the relations as above.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table (left-to-right, top-to-bottom approximate positions):**\n\n| Object         | Position        | Relative Size             |\n|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Blue whale     | Top left       | Largest                   |\n| Seagull        | Mid left       | 1/4 blue whale            |\n| Leopard seal   | Center         | 1/3 blue whale            |\n| Penguin        | Center right   | 1/4 blue whale            |\n| Killer whale   | Top right      | 1/2 blue whale            |\n| Elephant seal  | Mid right      | 1/2 blue whale            |\n| Squid          | Lower right    | 1/3 blue whale            |\n| Crab           | Bottom right   | 1/4 blue whale            |\n| Fish           | Lower left     | 1/5 blue whale            |\n| Krill          | Lower left     | 1/7 blue whale            |\n| Zooplankton    | Bottom left    | 1/10 blue whale           |\n| Phytoplankton  | Bottom left    | Smallest (1/15 blue whale)|\n| Seaweed        | Bottom center  | 1/8 blue whale            |\n\n---\n\nThis description contains the detailed geometric, color, label, and stylistic information required to accurately reproduce this food web as an SVG illustration."
