# mm-vet-visualizer

This is a simple, self-contained web-based tool to visualize and compare results from the **MM-Vet benchmark**. It provides an intuitive interface to analyze the performance of vision-language models on a set of evaluation questions.

The key feature of this visualizer is the side-by-side comparison of model performance on original images versus three synthetically generated variants (created by Claude Opus4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL-72B). The visualizer can display predictions from two models: **Qwen2.5-VL-7B** and **Qwen2.5-VL-3B**.

## Features

-   **Model Selection**: Easily switch between `Qwen-7B` and `Qwen-3B` results.
-   **Side-by-Side Image Comparison**: View the original image alongside three synthetic versions in a single row.
-   **Interactive Data Display**: Click on images, questions, answers, or predictions to view the full content in a modal popup.
-   **Dynamic Search**: Instantly filter the entire table by any keyword.
-   **Capability Filtering**: Narrow down the results based on specific AI capabilities (e.g., OCR, Math, Spatial Recognition).
-   **Color-Coded Scores**: Prediction scores are color-coded (green for correct, red for incorrect) for quick visual assessment.
-   **Zero-Setup**: Runs entirely in the browser. No server, dependencies, or build process needed.

## Project Structure

The project is organized to keep data files neatly separated from the main application logic.

```

│

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have all the data files and folders (`prediction/`, `score/`, `images/`, `mm-vet.json`) in the correct locations as described in the Project Structure.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The application will load the data and be ready to use.
