Typically, a dashed line indicates that the runway is in use for takeoff or landing. If the airplane is aligned with the centerline, it could be either taking off or landing.\n\n3. **Aircraft Configuration**: In a real-world scenario, if the airplane is taking off, it would typically be at full throttle, and the nose would be slightly elevated. Conversely, during landing, the airplane would be descending with its landing gear extended.\n\n4. **Surroundings**: The background shows buildings, which suggests that the airplane is near an airport.
