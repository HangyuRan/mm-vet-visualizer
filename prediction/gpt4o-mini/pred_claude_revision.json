However, a notable spike occurred in 2004, where immigration surged to approximately 500,000, marking the highest point in the decade. This increase could be attributed to various factors, including changes in immigration policy or global events that encouraged migration to the UK.\n\nIn contrast, emigration remained relatively stable throughout the period, hovering around 200,000 to 300,000 annually. The emigration rate peaked in 2004 as well, but it did not experience the same dramatic rise as immigration. \n\nThe net migration, calculated as the difference between immigration and emigration, shows a clear upward trend, particularly in 2004, indicating that the UK became a more attractive destination during this time. Overall, while immigration saw significant growth, emigration remained consistent, leading to a substantial increase in net migration figures.",

In contrast, industrial and domestic uses have increased at a slower pace, with industrial use reaching around 1,000 km³ and domestic use remaining the lowest, just above 500 km³.\n\nThe accompanying table compares water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, has a significantly higher water consumption per person at 359 m³, alongside a substantial area of irrigated land (26,500 km²). In stark contrast, the DRC, with a much smaller population of 5.2 million, has an extremely low water consumption per person of just 8 m³, despite having 100 km² of irrigated land.\n\nOverall, this data underscores the disparity in water consumption between developed and developing nations, with Brazil exhibiting higher agricultural and domestic water use compared to the DRC, reflecting differences in infrastructure, agricultural practices, and population needs.",

In contrast, divorce rates showed a steady increase, particularly notable in the 1980s and 1990s, with a peak of about 1.5 million divorces in 1990, before slightly decreasing to around 1.2 million in 2000. This indicates a growing trend of divorce relative to marriages during this period.\n\nThe second chart highlights the marital status of adults in 1970 and 2000. In 1970, a significant majority (around 70%) were married, while the percentage of those never married was relatively low at about 10%. By 2000, the percentage of never-married adults rose to approximately 30%, while the married population decreased to around 50%. The percentages of widowed and divorced individuals remained low but showed a slight increase over the 30 years.\n\nIn summary, the data reflects a decline in marriage rates alongside an increase in divorce rates and a growing proportion of adults who have never married, indicating a shift in societal attitudes towards marriage during this period.",

Initially, between 1868 and 1883, the village was primarily rural, with limited infrastructure. The establishment of Chorleywood Station in 1909 marked a pivotal moment, enhancing connectivity and encouraging residential growth.\n\nFrom 1883 to 1922, the village began to expand, as indicated by the development of new housing areas. This period saw the introduction of main roads, facilitating easier access to surrounding regions. The construction of the railway further accelerated this growth, attracting commuters seeking a suburban lifestyle.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1970, Chorleywood continued to evolve, with additional residential developments and amenities, including Chorleywood Park and Golf Course. The completion of the motorway in 1970 further transformed the village, making it more accessible and appealing to new residents.\n\nBy 1994, Chorleywood had developed into a thriving community, characterized by a blend of residential, recreational, and green spaces, reflecting its evolution from a small village to a suburban hub.
