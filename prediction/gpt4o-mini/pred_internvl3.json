However, a notable shift occurred in 2004, when immigration surged dramatically, peaking at around 600,000. This spike can be attributed to various factors, including the expansion of the European Union, which likely encouraged more individuals to migrate to the UK for work and opportunities.\n\nFollowing 2004, immigration levels remained high but began to decline slightly by 2007 and 2008. In contrast, emigration remained relatively stable throughout the period, fluctuating between 200,000 and 300,000. This resulted in a significant net migration increase, particularly in the mid-2000s, where the net figure reached its highest point.\n\nOverall, the data indicates a clear trend of increasing immigration to the UK during this period, with emigration remaining consistent, leading to a growing net migration rate.

    "v1_214": "The pie charts illustrate the changes in electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France for the years 1980 and 2000. \n\nIn Australia, total electricity production increased from 170 units in 1980 to 200 units in 2000. In 1980, the majority of electricity was generated from coal (green), followed by oil (red) and gas (blue). By 2000, while coal remained the dominant source, there was a noticeable increase in the contribution from gas, indicating a shift towards cleaner energy sources. Oil's share decreased significantly during this period.\n\nConversely, France's total electricity production rose from 180 units in 1980 to 480 units in 2000. In 1980, France relied heavily on nuclear energy (yellow), which accounted for a substantial portion of its production. By 2000, nuclear energy's share remained significant, but there was also an increase in renewable sources (green), reflecting a diversification of energy sources.\n\nIn summary, while Australia saw a modest increase in total production with a shift towards gas, France experienced a more substantial growth in production, maintaining a strong reliance on nuclear energy while incorporating more renewables.",
    "v1_215": "### Report on the Development of Chorleywood\n\nChorleywood, a village located near London, has experienced significant growth since the mid-nineteenth century. The development of the village can be traced through key infrastructural changes, particularly the construction of main roads and the motorway.\n\nBetween 1868 and 1883, the establishment of main roads facilitated better connectivity, encouraging residential and commercial development. This period marked the beginning of Chorleywood's transformation from a rural settlement into a more accessible community. The improved transport links attracted new residents, contributing to a steady increase in population.\n\nThe construction of the motorway, completed between 1883 and 1922, further accelerated this growth. The motorway provided direct access to London and other regions, making Chorleywood an attractive location for commuters. This accessibility not only enhanced the village's appeal but also led to the establishment of various amenities and services, catering to the growing population.\n\nOverall, the strategic development of transport infrastructure has played a crucial role in shaping Chorleywood into a thriving village, reflecting broader trends in suburban expansion around London. The ongoing population increase signifies the village's continued relevance in the region.",
    "v1_216": "The map of Garlsdon presents two potential sites for a new supermarket, labeled S1 and S2. \n\nSite S1 appears to be located in a more central area of the town, which could enhance accessibility for a larger number of residents. Being centrally positioned may attract more foot traffic and encourage local shoppers, potentially leading to higher sales. Additionally, proximity to other amenities could create a more vibrant shopping environment.\n\nIn contrast, Site S2 is situated further from the town center. This location might be less convenient for residents who rely on walking or public transport. However, if S2 is near major roads or highways, it could attract customers from surrounding areas, possibly compensating for the reduced local foot traffic.\n\nIn summary, Site S1 offers better accessibility for local residents, while Site S2 may benefit from external traffic. The decision on the supermarket's location should consider these factors to maximize customer reach and overall success.",
    "v1_217": "The diagram illustrates the systematic approach taken by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) to gather real-time weather data, which is essential for generating accurate forecasts. The process begins with data collection from various sources, including satellites, radar, digital systems, and synoptic observations. \n\nSatellites provide comprehensive imagery of weather patterns, while radar systems offer detailed information on precipitation and storm movements. Digital data sources contribute additional metrics, enhancing the overall understanding of atmospheric conditions. Synoptic observations, which involve the analysis of weather maps and patterns, further support this data collection.\n\nOnce the information is gathered, it undergoes analysis to interpret the data accurately. This analysis is crucial for preparing forecasts, which are then disseminated through multiple channels, including television news, radio broadcasts, and digital platforms. The integration of these diverse data sources and communication methods ensures that the public receives timely and reliable weather information, enabling them to make informed decisions based on current weather conditions. Overall, the BOM's structured approach exemplifies the importance of technology and collaboration in meteorological practices."
